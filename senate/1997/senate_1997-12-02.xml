<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Chair, I would suggest that, if there is something else we can move to, it might be appropriate to do so in terms of the amendments before us. I think amendments 269, 269A, 270, R271 and R272 in many respects are technical, and I do not know that they have been fully circulated at this stage. I can probably speak to them while you are trying to find other work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of 270 in particular, we are trying to ensure there is capacity for a dual stream registration test. Given the fact that Senator Minchin is not here, I think at this particular stage we should defer these amendments. Lots of them are consequential, and I would like to get further advice as to which ones we need to pursue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Chair, I suggest that we put the amendments individually. Proposed amendment 273 clarifies the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> power of the Federal Court regarding material on which the court may base its decision when reviewing a decision of the registrar. Basically, it will allow the court to pick up information and material that may not have been available to the registrar, so it is a minor amendment. In this sense it is an important one in that it makes the court process a bit more comprehensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed amendment 274 gives the power to the Federal Court to extend the statutory period for the registration of applications on two conditions: if the court is of the view that the claimant has a reasonably arguable case, and, as importantly, if the court is also of the view that the opposing side will not suffer unjustifiable hardship. We say that is a bit of a balance to ensure protection for both sides. We argue that obviously in some circumstances there is a need for the extension of the statutory period. As I said last night, the period as now proposed is excessively rigid and, through no fault of the claimant, the claimant could find themselves struck out because of the activities of someone else, particularly the tribunal. The transitional application is one that was also canvassed broadly last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed amendment 353 is an amendment which deals with the application of the new registration test to applications lodged after 27 June 1996, which, as I said last night, is the date upon which the government announced that the new registration test was to take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process that we are proposing in amendment 353 provides for the appropriate minister to request that the registrar apply the new registration test to applications lodged after 27 June. In the first instance, the registrar must give representatives of claimants and rep bodies the opportunity to comply with the new test, but only for 60 days when the registrar will then assess the application against the new test, if there is a need for him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point we were making last night was that in respect of the registration test it is important that, if we are to go back past the end of June last year, then we will be constitutionally secure in terms of what we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9976"> doing. We claim that the government's proposal is retrospective and discriminatory and is possibly at the end of the day either invalid or compensable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal we are suggesting is for the registrar to involve the rep bodies and give them six months to try and get a conciliation of all the common rights of interest and make them subject to one application. If that does not happen within that period, then the National Native Title Tribunal or, if there is a state or territory body, that body will arbitrate the amalgamation applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that is a practical way to go, particularly given the amount of work the tribunal will be doing over the next six months anyway. It is a practical way to go. It involves the parties. Basically, it can get the rep bodies to do a lot of the work of the tribunal. But, if the work is not done in a timely manner&mdash;and six months is not a long time given the numbers of applications we might be talking about here&mdash;then the tribunal can intervene and ensure a conciliation process. All these proposals are put up in the interests of workability.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I did comment on these amendments yesterday, but the government is unable to accept them. Amendment 273 relates to the review by the Federal Court and we have an appropriate review section in 190D where an applicant may apply to the Federal Court for effectively judicial review. The effect of the opposition's amendment would be to allow the court itself to remake the registrar's decision and put itself in the place of registrar in determining whether a claim had met the registration test. We think this would amount to a proposal that would add considerable uncertainty, be inappropriate legally and procedurally and should be unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also amendment 274 allows the applicant to apply to the Federal Court for an extension of time for registration after the issue of a section 29 notice. Again, this is nothing more than a recipe for tremendous uncertainty in that it can significantly delay the whole right to negotiate process. If you are talking about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> multimillion dollar proposals where you want to get the negotiation process under way, see if agreement can be reached and, if not, go to arbitration, this allows an enormous opportunity to stall and delay the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not provided for in the current Native Title Act and there is no such mechanism. It was not thought appropriate then. Why is the ALP now wanting to insert such a proposal which does not go to its professed standard of certainty, but will simply produce enormous uncertainty for those seeking to invest in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have extended the registration period by our own amendments, which we think will satisfy the obvious desirability of native title parties having appropriate time to have their claims registered. But we do not believe that the Federal Court having the capacity to have a full hearing and then extend the time period is conducive to anybody's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to amendment 353 concerning the application of the registration test, there is no point in the new registration test if most of the claims currently in the system are not tested in some way or another. Already nearly 50 per cent of country has been claimed, so we are whistling in the wind if we talk about a new registration test exempting one way or another most of the current claims from it when a section 29 notice is issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively we introduced this new registration test back in June last year and made the statement then that claims made after that date would be subject to the new registration test, so there is no retrospectivity in that sense. That is the way governments operate in many fields of endeavour. Where the legislation is introduced, notice is given and claims or activities made after that date are subject to the new test. In relation to claims made before that date, it is not at all inappropriate that, where a section 29 notice is issued after the commencement of these provisions, an existing claim is then subject to that new registration test in respect of a section 29 notice issued after the commencement of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems to us again not to entail any retrospectivity. The claim is there and of course the claim can proceed as a claim for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9977"> determination of native title. But as to the appropriate registration of the claim in response to a section 29 notice, it does not seem at all inappropriate that, when the notice is issued after the commencement of these provisions, the new test is then applied to that claim to determine whether the claimants may be parties to the negotiation in relation to that section 29 notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Otherwise the test is not going to be applied to many of the claims already in the system and not solve the problem which we thought the ALP agreed needed to be solved. For those reasons, as I think I said yesterday, we cannot accept those amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.43 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a strange response from the minister. It is a curious one, because I do not know whether he actually understands what we are doing or trying to do, or in fact wants to admit that there are some deficiencies in his own proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the last point first. We have no problem with the starting date for the test being 27 June 1996. We have said that, but what we say is that our provision to go back before that date is a much broader one than the government's. His does not pick up cross claims. He does not pick up comprehensively the question of overlaps. He picks up some in respect to those where the section 29 process is initiated, but what we say is that our process is there to pick up all cross claims and all overlapping claims prior to 27 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the problem is in trying to do that. We are trying to do it and we are trying to do it in a way which we think is constitutionally sustainable by involving the rep bodies in the process first. If they cannot get people to sit together and conciliate it, then after 60 days&mdash;in this broader category, not just the section 29 overlaps&mdash;the tribunal can get into the action and conciliate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are really concerned about overlapping claims, the WA goldfields and so on, the government would be looking at our proposal, because it is broader. It catches more than the government's and, in the way that we propose it, it is constitutionally sustainable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point the minister makes is, why bring in the court process now? In that argument he wants to have it both ways. He says, `They bring in the court process' and fair enough they do, but then he says, `But you cannot bring in the capacity to go to court.' Why not? We are actually saying that the court process should be used for particularly good reasons&mdash;for example, where there are allegations of fraud or so on. We think where it is necessary&mdash;and we are not suggesting it as a broad measure&mdash;it is important to invoke the capacity to go to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says, `Well, it was not in your act, so why are you bringing it in now?'

<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem of overlapping claims is a serious one. We have sought to address it in the registration test so that the registrar is acting to minimise the extent to which there are overlapping claims, without prejudicing anyone independently making a separate claim, but to avoid the problem whereby people are making multiple claims when they are in the same claim group&mdash;they are in one claim group and in another claim group. Clause 190C(3) was designed to prevent that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of our much upgraded rep body provisions, we have also sought to ensure that rep bodies have a primary role in this. Under 203BE(3) we talk about `overlapping applications for determination of native title' in relation to the rep bodies' responsibilities to minimise that problem. The trouble with the ALP's approach of saying, in relation to claims already lodged before 27 June 1996, `Let's throw that back into the arms of the rep bodies to see if they can work it out,' is that up to this point that clearly has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the Goldfields Land Council has used its best endeavours to try to seek some resolution of the enormous problem it has there, but it has no legislative backing or capacity because of the current registration test. There is no capacity for them, as a matter of law or direction, to achieve that outcome. It is all based on good faith and goodwill. There are break&hyphen;outs on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is perfectly proper that if a new registration test has been designed it should apply to claims already in the system, but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only when a new section 29 notice is issued. It is not retrospective in that sense. The registration test is for parties wishing to be involved in the right to negotiate process in response to section 29 notices, so the test will only apply in respect of section 29 notices issued after these provisions come into effect. The claimants in the system would then need to satisfy the registrar of the new registration test in order to participate in the right to negotiate in respect of the new section 29 notices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that is the only sensible way to ensure that you minimise the number of frivolous or vexatious claims, or those of less worth, that are involved in the right to negotiate process so that the parties that are involved are those that are able to satisfy the new registration test and, therefore, parties with the greatest likelihood of ultimately succeeding in their native title claims and, therefore, the most appropriate to be parties to the negotiation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regime is one which gives the rep bodies very little time, but the compulsion is the fact that if the rep bodies do not work it out within six months, then the tribunal can conciliate and arbitrate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having that sort of threat down the line&mdash;I suppose that is the best way to put it&mdash;would put pressure on parties to conciliate before it got to the tribunal.

There are instances I know of where the company itself has been involved with cowboy practices and has engaged in actions that have encouraged multiple claims because they were not really prepared to sit down and negotiate through the issues.

That is the kind of issue that should be addressed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the points I made earlier in the debate was the question of the constitutionality of what you are proposing. We have not had a chance to address that this morning, but I think it is important that we do. I think the government acknowledges that what they are doing here is taking away an existing right. I would like to put on the record in this part of the debate the comments of Justice McHugh in the Waanyi case. It is important to put this before us because I think there are some real constitutional problems with what the government is proposing. What they are proposing takes away an existing right of any claimant. Mr Justice McHugh said the following on page 52 of that judgement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ignore the procedures of the Act and to determine the extinguishment issue before the Waanyi People had had an opportunity to utilise their rights under the Act would be both a breach of the Act and an injustice to the Waanyi People. To refuse to correct that breach because to do so would serve the social or economic interests of other persons would be a step calculated to undermine the rule of law in our community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are some pretty strong words here. He goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9984">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community will quickly lose confidence in the courts of justice if a perception arises that the courts are ready to ignore the legal rights of individuals whenever intervening governments or litigants urge that public or private convenience requires such rights to be by&hyphen;passed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those comments could be made about the parliament as they could be made about the court. What we draw from those comments is a real concern from the bench about taking away people's property rights. What we are talking about in your reaching&hyphen;back provisions is taking away existing rights&mdash;the right to negotiate&mdash;by reassessing a claim which was lawfully lodged and accepted under the law. People exercise their rights under the law. They start off the process by putting their claims in. What you are saying is let us reach back and let us cut apart their legal capacity to pursue those claims because of the new test that you are proposing that we take back retrospectively to pre 27 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the real problem you have with your proposal, putting aside time lines and whatever. Justice McHugh was not in the majority in many of these cases, but on this point he reflects probably a seven&hyphen;nil position of the court in respect of property rights. You have problems here. Why we say ours is better is because what we involve in the process is a capacity for consent. There is a capacity for the different parties in terms of overlapping claims to be brought together and to consent to an outcome. The aspect of consent is an important aspect when it comes to constitutionality. That has also been made very clear by the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, the easy question to ask you is: have you had advice on the constitutionality of this point? Will you make that advice available? Don't you acknowledge that, by stripping away a pre&hyphen;existing property right, you would have constitutional problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before you go to the question of legal advice, in the last couple of months we had the Newcrest case involving Coronation Hill in the Northern Territory where the court on a four to three majority found against the government. We have had the Mewett case&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> case&mdash;where the court held seven&hyphen;nil that the sorts of rights to action that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we are talking about here are property rights and cannot be taken away retrospectively, particularly in a racist manner which this proposal does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say to you is that, on a constitutional basis, you have to look at our proposal because of the capacity to involve the claimants and to get consent through the process. If you do not do that, you have some problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think sometimes we get so caught up with the legal arguments that we fail to acknowledge there are moral questions here as well. Many Aboriginal groups and representatives have spoken to me and have acknowledged that there are some difficulties with the process, but they have also told me it is a question of acknowledging the difficulties and requiring time to sort them out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not just dealing here with a legal right. Aboriginal people think the government is stripping back their rights. They see that there are problems in realising their rights under some of the current situations that have been created in the way the 1993 legislation was drafted, but they are asking&mdash;and I do not think it is an unreasonable thing&mdash;for the ability to sort this out. If we leave anything for indigenous Australians, we should at least acknowledge that right to sort out some of these difficulties so we cannot continue to point to them and blame them for any difficulties and hold-ups within the court system, because that is what has happened so far. There has been the creation of this blame, when in fact there are many people within indigenous Australia who wish to have the opportunity to sort out these difficulties for all concerned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The right to negotiate is a statutory procedural right, not a per se property right, and that is the government's clear view.

That is not retrospectivity or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9985"> the denial of a right. The claim is in the system. The right to pursue the property right&mdash;that is, the common law right to native title&mdash;is not affected in anyway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not say that. You read his advice. His advice is very clear and he says that the bill is constitutional. But even if that argument were sustainable or you were to accept it&mdash;that is, that a statutory procedural right could be argued to be an acquisition of property&mdash;by providing full, just terms compensation, which we do in the catch&hyphen;all provision in the bill, there is no question about any constitutionality. So the argument has no legs whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do not understand is where the ALP is coming from. If you think your process will weed out, so to speak, the frivolous claims, will merge claims or will lead to a minimisation of the number of overlapping claims, then presumably there will be claimants who will, in effect, not be part of the claims process. So by your own argument, you condemn your own provisions. On the other hand, you are saying that all the multiple claims can and should be able to stay there. I think there is a convoluted logic in the argument you are putting in respect of your attempt to seek to rationalise the number of claims in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are saying is that the common law right to claim native title remains. There is a statutory procedural right. The application of that in the future shall be subject to the new registration test. There are many instances at law where that would apply and I am just trying to think of equivalent procedures. For example, if you have a right to drive, then the laws relating to the exercise of that right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change all the time and in the future that right is affected. That happens in a whole range of legal fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the parliament deems that in future when an act giving rise to the right to negotiate is given notice of, it is quite appropriate for claims already in the system to be subject to a new threshold test. Otherwise, all the claims in the system up until June 1996 will forever be entitled to participate in the right to negotiate on any part of the land claim, and some of these claims cover huge parts of Queensland and other states. So whenever there is any mining development, they automatically participate in the right to negotiate, regardless of whether they are frivolous or otherwise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Minister, you have not really answered the question. Firstly, I asked you to take note of the fact that, when we talk about the right to negotiate, let us acknowledge that we are talking about a right that was traded and obtained when the Aboriginal communities cashed in some general common law rights in this area&mdash;the capacity, I suppose, under the common law to effectively drag out processes for a long time. There is a mixture here of a common law right and a statutory procedural right. If, for instance, people felt they had been unfairly denied a right under your proposal, they would be able to go to court for a claim in terms of a reduction of not only their statutory procedural right but also their common law right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, you argue that we are convoluted, but I made the point&mdash;and for some reason you were not listening&mdash;that in these matters, as has been evidenced before both committees, the consent of the communities involved is fairly critical. What we do is put up a process whereby that consent can be obtained in the early parts of the process. That gives it some constitutional security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, I suppose we go back to the point that you are denying people and denying them retrospectively, whether it is a statutory right or the capacity to pursue their rights under this act. They can go alternatively to the common law. To the extent that it can be compensatable, it may very well be, but there are other questions of just terms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9986"> compensation which also go to your regime here. As you full know, Justice Deane in the Tasmanian dams case indicated that there needs to be some contemporaneous aspect to the mechanism to provide for just terms compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point needs to be made, and I will go back to Justice McHugh in the judgment of Waanyi where, a few paragraphs before the last section I quoted, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt some miners, pastoralists and other persons believe that the procedures of the Act are unfair, that they create uncertainty and delay that can force interested parties to buy off unmeritorious claims, and that they prevent or impede the exploitation of important national resources. But such beliefs are beside the point. Parliament has laid down the law. It has attached valuable rights to an accepted claim, rights that are exercisable by a claimant before the validity of the claim is judicially determined. The Act has given claims of native title an economic as well as a spiritual and physical dimension.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The court acknowledges that what we are talking about here are valuable property rights laid down by law. All we are asking is for you to treat them with the degree of legal and moral respect that you would have others treat any such rights that you might have in any process you may be involved with in respect of your property. Do not turn a blind eye to these constitutional and compensatory provisions. That is what we are asking of you. When you get a message from Justice McHugh saying that there are some real problems involved here, do not turn a blind eye to Justice McHugh because his position is one that is often quite critical in the court and he has made it very clear of what he thinks of the rights here. Once again, you are doing it unilaterally, from the top, taking away property rights and causing constitutional and compensation problems. We are suggesting to you a way through it and a way through it which should form the basis of a solution to this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all fascinated to know what sorts of deals were done back in 1993. You say now that the Aboriginal leaders you dealt with cashed in their common law rights in return for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right to negotiate. That is a quite extraordinary proposition. Are you suggesting that this parliament allowed a veto over the question of whether or not everything done prior to the Native Title Act was to be validated? The parliament had a clear responsibility&mdash;as you well know; you stated it many times&mdash;to ensure the legal validity of everything done prior to the Native Title Act, and you did it and you needed to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking of deals, we understand&mdash;and this has been stated many times&mdash;that a deal was done in relation to pastoral leases. There was an acknowledgment that native title had been extinguished on pastoral leases so, as part of the deal, you set up the Indigenous Land Fund to enable Aboriginal people to buy $45 million worth of pastoral leases every year forever. On current value, they could buy, as I understand it, every pastoral lease on Cape York in one year out of that deal. The land fund stays, but now we have native title on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to deal with this in terms of the current problems caused by the operation of the Native Title Act&mdash;many of the problems which you have acknowledged. One of them is the extraordinary problem of multiple overlapping claims in respect of a whole lot of mining and exploration in this country&mdash;a lot of it not involving the BHPs and the Western Minings but the Jack Otways of the world that I mentioned yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that a statutory procedural right in the future should be accessed by an appropriate registration test&mdash;a registration test which, I accept through no fault of your own, was watered-down by a number of interpretations and court decisions about its operation. It is essential that a new registration test be put in place. It is not being applied retrospectively. It is being applied prospectively whenever a future section 29 notice is issued. It is entirely, as Justice McHugh was saying, a matter for the parliament to determine what administrative procedures should be in place to access a statutory right in the future. It does not go to the common law property right of the claimants, which can be pursued through this act in respect of all claims lodged before 27 June 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9987"> 1996. We think this is entirely an appropriate matter for the parliament to legislate on in respect of future access to the right to negotiate to solve many of the problems which are, self-evidently, a consequence of the operation of the act over the last four years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Minchin, you know full well what I meant by `traded off'. In fact, it is very much on the public record. We do not have to go through it comprehensively, but we do know that, in the interests of certainty for themselves and for other stakeholders, Aboriginal Australians did trade-off some capacity to pursue common law rights and that was reflected in the legislation. So do not come in here acutely suspicious of what went on at that particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what went on at that time, we have you well and truly on the record telling people that pastoral leases did not extinguish native title necessarily. That is very clearly on the record as well, despite the fact that you now claim that it was your obligation as a loyal member of the team to argue that particular point. You knew then. In terms of those trade&hyphen;offs, we do not have to revisit that comprehensively this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one point that we do need to address this morning is the constitutionality of your provision. I think you gave the game away when you said that indigenous Australians can in respect of those pre-1996 rights pursue their claims under common law. Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to actually encourage them to pursue them under the Native Title Act? Isn't that what this act is all about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are saying to those who feel unfairly handled by the process, `You still have your common law rights,' why not take the extra step and process what we are suggesting to try to give them some confidence in the processes of the act? You are not going to give certainty to those people in Kalgoorlie or elsewhere in terms of overlapping claims if you are saying and acknowledging, as you have this morning, that people feeling aggrieved can pursue their common law rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly in response to that, the claim can be pursued under the act. The native title claim for determination of native title can be pursued under the act. The question is whether, additionally, there is access to the statutory right to negotiate. There is general agreement, as stated by the deputy chair of ATSIC, that there are a lot of frivolous claims participating in the right to negotiate process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that the new test to ensure that only legitimate claims participate in the right to negotiate process in respect of future section 29 notices should be applied. Otherwise, you solve nothing; you do not solve the problem at all. You are still left with claims which cannot meet even the standards of the new registration test as amended by the Senate and therefore are participating in it and therefore, frankly, are acting against the interests of legitimate native title claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your process is a wing and a prayer to try to rationalise them. As I said, you have not answered this question: if your intention is to rationalise the claims, what about their rights? You are saying that you want to try to minimise and reduce the number of claims involved in the right to negotiate. As I say, you are hoisted on your own petard of your own argument if what you are saying you will achieve is achieved. We think it much better simply to put in place the application of the new test. Whenever a section 29 notice is issued in future, the claim itself, if it fails to meet that new test, can of course be dealt with as a claim for determination of native title under the Native Title Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In short, these amendments will prevent, so far as is appropriate, overlapping native title applications and they will also reflect the general law of joint ownership of property. We propose that we allow the overlapping of applications only in rare situations where the rights claimed in a later application are different to but consistent with those claimed in the former application. I think it would be very unfair to bounce those sorts of rights where the right claimed in a later application is different to but consistent with the earlier one. With respect to overlapping applications claiming common rights, we propose that the later application cannot be registered unless it asserts that the common law rights are held jointly with the earlier applicants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9989">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals provide a degree of fairness. If one were to look at the two situations we are trying to pick up, it would be very hard to argue that people in those two circumstances should not be able to lodge a claim even though to a certain extent it could be recognised as overlapping. They are two very tight circumstances. Where someone is claiming common rights, there has got to be an assertion that they are held jointly. Of course, there is capacity thereafter for the registrar to ensure that they are handled and processed together. With respect to the earlier proviso, we are talking about a very rare situation where the rights claimed are different to but consistent with the overall application. People might in fact be claiming for a different access, different definition of the native title rights from a different application. I think these are very fair proposals. That is a word which I suppose is used very unfairly these days but, looking at it from the perspective of the two groups we are trying to protect, you cannot argue that it is not fair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe there is a misunderstanding about what is intended here. There is a problem which has been brought to our attention by Aboriginal people, that you have situations where the same people are parties to different claims and therefore members of a variety of competing claims. That is a fact and one which Aboriginal groups themselves are seeking to prevent. What our 190C(3) merely seeks to do is to say that the registrar must be satisfied that no person included in the native title claim group for the application was a member of a claim group for any previous application&mdash;that is, that is already on the books&mdash;so that you do not get the situation of the one person being a member of two or more competing claims. We think that is important, and this amendment 269 removes that therefore allows that problem to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I do not know whether this is an actual misunderstanding, but there is absolutely nothing in our amendments which prevents claims to the same area of land being made by different native title claim groups and

It does not matter how many there are, if they are all capable of passing the registration test they can all be registered if they involve different claim groups. All we are trying to do is minimise that overlap of people between groups which has been brought to our attention by indigenous groups as a problem. Our bill will not prevent different groups making applications for registration in respect of exactly the same area. There is no attempt to mathematically limit it in any way. If there are 100 groups that all pass the test, they can all be registered. All we are seeking to do is ensure&mdash;in response, frankly, to something that has come from indigenous people&mdash;that we are talking about different groups. At the end of the day they may all get native title. If there were, for the purposes of this debate, 100 different groups that exercised traditional law and custom in that area, they will all get native title. I am not sure whether there is a misunderstanding of the effect of what we are proposing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to explain that the Democrat and Greens (WA) amendments were certainly the position of the National Indigenous Working Group. They are an improvement on what the ALP is proposing, I have got to say. Our amendments would prevent, in so far as that is appropriate, overlapping claims. However, they would permit such claims where different rights and interests are claimed by different groups and where common rights and interests are jointly held by different groups. We believe the ALP amendments do not take sufficient cognisance of that, and certainly the amendments we are putting forward would improve on that. However, to avoid muddying the water, I think the National Indigenous Working Group would be prepared to go with the ALP amendments, and so we would also.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments by the minister would indicate that he speaks to some of the problems but not necessarily the source of the problems. That is often the problem with coming and saying things like, `I have been told by groups that there are problems with overlapping claims.' As I have mentioned before, the problems are not necessarily the creation of indigenous groups. The problems are often the creation of the way companies have operated and the way pressure has been put on people and the way people have been picked off, marginalised or isolated by the way the process has taken place. It is also often a problem of inadequate resources to rep bodies; not just land councils but those more localised rep bodies for which people have a greater affinity. That could be their corporations. Some of them are just setting up now in order to speak to and liaise with land councils and so on. So those problems are ones in relation to the way the operation has taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible within Aboriginal society, depending on the nature of the group and the context in which that group is put together, for a person to be correspondingly a member of a clan, a moiety and a larger group, all at the same time. Those claims will be different in their size and scope, depending on the time of year and so on that those groups get together on a normal basis. So the reality is that it is actually possible for one person to be legitimately on more than one claim. It is a bit like you being a member of society, a member of the parliament and a member of a family. You are actually a member of all of those groups simultaneously. It is a different context, but I would ask the minister to listen a little more carefully. Yes, there are problems with the way claims are operating in some ways, but I believe the problems are associated with the way the law has been drafted, and often the problems are with resources and with the way corporations and companies have acted towards indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is whether or not you can have one person on three different claims. It is possible for that to happen legitimately. To 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suggest that that is an oddity that we cannot cope with is not necessarily showing a great deal of understanding of indigenous culture. There may also be problems that are sorted out in relation to resourcing, and that is the sort of thing that over the last couple of hours we have been asking the minister to take seriously. I think that the opposition's amendments do at least take those kinds of issues into consideration, and I really think the government is going about it the wrong way. I would urge the Senate to support in preference the National Indigenous Working Group amendments, but I am indicating that I could also be prepared to support the opposition amendments in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I also respond to Senator Minchin. We have just adopted your regime in terms of overlapping provisions. What we are trying to do here is to recognise that there are some circumstances where overlapping may very well take place. You say that your legislation already allows for it, but I have got to say to you that your 190C(3) makes it very clear that no person included in the native title claim group for a current application could be so included if he or she were a member of a native title claim group for any previous application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do you do with situations where people have got&mdash;as I think Senator Woodley put on the record last night very clearly through Professor Marcia Langton's work&mdash;affiliations with more than one clan or more than one group, either through marriage or for some other reason? Those people would not be able to pursue their claim in a subsequent proceeding under your 190C(3). It is very clear there. That is the sort of concern that we have. What we say is: you have got your regime in terms of overlap, put a bit compassion into it and acknowledge that people can in fact be members of two different clans, and as a consequence recognise that your 190C(3) is too rigid, too inflexible and will deliver injustice to quite a few people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not acknowledge that. As I say, the driving 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9991"> force for this was the thing that I found in all my consultations last year, and that was that the greatest complaint from Aboriginal groups&mdash;and indeed Mr Pearson himself&mdash;was the problem that any individual could go and make a claim, an individual could be a member of a number of claim groups, and that led to the problem of multiple claims. I acknowledge what Senator Margetts is saying about companies. There are, as I understand it, some companies which quite improperly have encouraged this sort of behaviour and I condemn it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you allow a situation where families or clans can each individually make claims and they can be parties to different claims, and then they all participate in the right to negotiate, you end up with the situation we have got now, with 20 or 30 different claimant groups all of whom need to be negotiated with. The chances of reaching agreement are absolutely minimal in those circumstances. And that is the complaint coming from Aboriginal groups that are seeking to reach agreement: you get agreement from 20 of the 21 but one holds out&mdash;no agreement. Of course, that is a big part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are saying that we want like&hyphen;minded groups to consolidate their claim and make their claim, but if there are genuinely different groups with different native title rights which they seek in different tradition and law and custom, then of course there is nothing in our act which prevents that occurring. If the right to negotiate is all about ultimately trying to reach agreement in relation to the prospective mining development, then that is going to be facilitated by the operation of clauses like 190C(3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not oppressive. It simply says that a claim cannot be registered if a person who is in the claim group is already in another claim group&mdash;they are part of the process. It simply means that you make sure there is not that overlap of people across claims. It has no effect on the number of claims that can be made, and if they are all capable of being registered, they will all be registered and all participate. Otherwise, you will end up with a situation where you are not dealing with this current problem of 20 or 30 different 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claimants and the real difficulty of ever reaching agreement in those circumstances.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What you are doing is purely and simply stopping people from asserting the full range of their common law rights. And you are doing that to individuals. In respect of those people who you are stopping from being able to claim the full range of their common law property rights, what will they do? They get bounced by your 190C(3), they have a common law right, they go to court and they get compensation because their rights have been extinguished. What we are asking for here is a bit of sense and justice. If you want a sensible and a certain outcome, then you try and encourage these people to stay under the umbrella of the act. Under this particular provision, anyone who has their rights denied, under a whole body of existing common law, has a compensatable claim and in the process there is uncertainty for the respondents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A bit of justice would not go too far astray here either, when you are talking about stopping a subsequent claim by a native title group because one person may have had an affiliation with a previous group, and as a consequence of that affiliation the subsequent application cannot be proceeded with. Their families are like ours, I suppose. People do have affiliations across clans, across different parts of our community. Why can't we acknowledge that in the multicultural dimension of Aboriginal Australia people can in fact have different clans and affiliations? They do, in the same way that we do. But what you are saying is, if they do, then they cannot pursue and exercise their full range of common law property rights by that very rigid application of 190C(3).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support what Senator Bolkus is saying. Don't think that overlapping rights are simply something that native title claimants dream up. There has been more than one occasion when mining companies themselves have interfered with native title claimants in their own areas and have caused overlapping claims. If we apply a rigid test, what we do is make it impossible to sort out not only the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9992"> overlapping claims by native title claimants, but also the interference which has occurred on more than one occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to give you one example and it comes from South Australia. Actually, it has been before the Supreme Court of South Australia and, I believe, the High Court, and it was to do with the Pitjantjatjara people. Some years ago, after very extensive, very extended and very long negotiation, the Pitjantjatjara people came to an agreement with a couple of mining companies over what land should be mined and what land should be preserved. However, there was one mining company which was left out of the loop. So what they did was they went to an Aboriginal man who did not belong to the Pitjantjatjara people but who happened to be a pastor. They made him a director of their company and sent him up to the Pitjantjatjara lands, ostensibly to preach the gospel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, after he had gathered people together and had had a couple of services, he then gathered them together to press the claim of this other mining company. To cut a long story short, it divided the community very seriously. He claimed, when the Pitjantjatjara council excluded him from that community, that they had excluded him for preaching the gospel, which of course was simply not true. They excluded him because he had represented a rival mining company and divided the community, because the mining companies themselves wanted to get a piece of the action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the kind of complicated interference which can occur and which cannot be solved by a rigid application of the kind of test which the government is trying to apply. But it is not just native title claimants who initiate overlapping claims. You can have that kind of interference in a community. That is one example. It has certainly happened more than once, but that is a classic case of what can happen when communities are interfered with, which cannot be dealt with by the rigid application of the amendment which the government is moving. I appeal to the government to listen to what we are saying and to support the amendments moved in 269.</PARA>

I am not sure that the slur upon his character which we have just heard is appropriate in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I take the opportunity to say that the granting of inalienable freehold land to the Pitjantjatjara people was one of the great initiatives of the Tonkin Liberal government and one which all South Australians are very proud of. But I am not quite sure of its relevance here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of what Senator Bolkus is saying, what we are talking about here in 190C(3) is the registration test. This is not about an application for determination of native title and the pursuit of common law rights. This does not apply to that question. Of course, those common law rights can be pursued in any way thought appropriate, but we are responding to what has been put to us by all parties to right to negotiate proceedings who are trying to develop a mechanism which will enable agreements to be reached that are fair and sensible to all parties and avoid arbitration and all that that involves; and we are seeking, by 190C(3), to encourage in effect the consolidation of claims merely by saying that you have your claim registered if you are a member of two or more claimant groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only repeat that it does not prevent the lodgment of any number of claims to participate in the right to negotiate. If you do not have this provision, you are removing a major incentive to ensure that there is a consolidation of claims; you are actively encouraging the current situation of multiple overlapping claims and really removing one of the methods by which we sought to meet the concerns of indigenous leaders in seeking to ensure a workable right to negotiate process.</PARA></SPEECH>

Aboriginal society, biology and genealogy are not the only possible basis for collectively held native title rights: there are skin groups, totem groups and so on.

But to say that in relation to the right to negotiate in attempting to seek agreement with a mining company, an explorer or whatever, you identify with one claim group for the purposes of the negotiation and not two, or 100, seems eminently sensible, because it does not cut across the right to pursue the claim under the act, but it does seek to achieve a workable mechanism for achieving outcomes by agreement through the right to negotiate process. It does not deny anyone the right to be part of a claim group. It encourages the consolidation of claims so that groups can reach agreement, but if there are, as I say, 100 different claim groups and they are all capable of being registered, they can all be registered. There is nothing to prevent that in any of these provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I take this opportunity to speak in respect of Senator Margetts's quite legitimate interest in the question of funding of rep bodies. There are currently 26 determined representative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bodies. The funds allocated over the last three financial years were: 1994&hyphen;95, $20.7 million; 1995&hyphen;96, $28.4 million; and 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;in our first budget&mdash;$42.1 million. So there has been a more than doubling in the first two years, and we are maintaining it at that level. So we think the resource allocation to those bodies is quite significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of representative bodies, I think this is one area of the bill where there is, broadly speaking, general agreement. We have rejected the assertions put by some in the Aboriginal community that we should not enhance the role and place of representative bodies in the system. We do not agree; we think that the management of the native title process is enhanced by having well&hyphen;resourced, professional and accountable representative bodies who are genuinely representative and accountable. Our provisions generally achieve that end in a way which does ensure that accountability and effectiveness&mdash;accountability, essentially, to ATSIC on a day to day basis, but ultimately to the minister in the strategic sense. There is an allocation of mandatory and other functions to the rep bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the big difference of opinion is over our proposal to re&hyphen;examine the status of current rep bodies against the new criteria. We do think that, to ensure the confidence of everybody in the current representative bodies, they should be required to demonstrate that they can meet these new responsibilities. They are given priority in the system. They are given the first opportunity to apply for recognition and a 12&hyphen;month period in which to do so, so we do think that, to ensure that level of confidence and appropriate accountability, there is no reason that existing rep bodies should not go through a re&hyphen;recognition process, given the completely changed arrangements. So we will not be supporting amendments which would seek to remove that re&hyphen;recognition process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the government amendments, which are essentially technical. Amendment 77 provides for a new subsection 203AC(1A), which explains the time frames for the minister to make decisions about recognition applications. Generally, the minister must 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9997"> make decisions as soon as practicable after an invitation period, extension, or further information request period has expired. Where the application is made by an existing rep body during the transition period in response to such an invitation the application must be decided before the end of the transition period. I guess that was the intent, but that will now be given direct effect to by this amendment and it obviously acknowledges that current rep bodies do need to know by the end of that period whether they have been so recognised or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 78 gives the National Native Title Tribunal from the end of the transition period the new functions of assisting or mediating under any provision of the act and of entering into contracts with representative bodies to assist with their dispute resolution functions. Again, I would have thought that should be acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 79, which is linked to Labor amendment 81, provides that the tribunal may assist a representative body in its dispute resolution functions if there is an agreement between the body and the tribunal under which the body pays the tribunal for that professional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 80, again linked to 81, removes the requirement that grants be made in respect of a financial year or part of a financial year, because under 81 grants may be able to be made for a period of up to three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 81 provides a new subsection 203C(3) which allows ATSIC to make grants for periods of up to three years, consistent with other grant provisions relating to ATSIC. It enables ATSIC to make grants for the same duration as the strategic plan required to be prepared by the rep body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 82 simply makes it clear that funding given to rep bodies is to be subject to a condition that, if a rep body loses its recognition, the rep body must return any uncommitted funds to ATSIC. Again, I would have thought this was an unexceptionable amendment. It does not require the rep body to repay any money actually paid out by or to another person, nor does it prevent the rep body from meeting any liabilities already incurred before de&hyphen;recognition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 83 is the technical amendment that arose out of the parliamentary committee inquiry in relation to the definition of a bank to make sure that it includes credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 84 provides protection for certain information disclosed during the audit or investigation of a rep body. New subsections 203DF(6) and (7) restrict the uses that can be made by the auditor or investigator of documents or information subject to legal privilege, and that auditors or investigators are to be regarded as Commonwealth officers for the purposes of certain secrecy provisions under the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 85, the final government amendment, makes it clear that a rep body must allow an auditor or investigator full access to all documents relating to the rep body whether or not such documents contain legally privileged information, but a rep body will still be able to claim in other proceedings that such documents are subject to legal professional privilege.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is some common ground with the government with respect to representative bodies. But there is also one very critical and major area of difference, the one flagged by Senator Minchin&mdash;the re&hyphen;recognition process. We share a concern to ensure that rep bodies are well resourced. We share that concern with other parties in this place, the Greens and the Democrats. There is no doubt that after this act, one way or another, the rep bodies will have more functions; they will be more accountable and they will be integral to the workability of the legislation in the long term but critically integral to the workability in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bodies need to be well resourced and they need to operate competently and with accountability. Our principles are that accountability is necessary. We support most of the government measures in that respect. But we say that accountability should not be at the whim of the minister, and these bodies should not be essentially there at the whim of whomever the minister may be for a particular period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be a degree of self&hyphen;determination embodied in the legislation that is passed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9998"> by this parliament this week or next week. That self&hyphen;determination has to acknowledge that indigenous Australians have been seeking self&hyphen;determination and deserve it and, to the extent that this parliament addresses the issue, we will need to have that as one of the fundamental principles driving us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability and self&hyphen;determination can best come through an involvement of ATSIC in the process of accountability. That is one of the fundamental parts of the amendments that we will be moving. With ATSIC having a core role, there needs to be a role for the minister. That ministerial role should be there, and it should be subject to procedural fairness to organisations involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rep bodies are going to be integral to the workability of the scheme, particularly in this forthcoming immediate period. But what is the government proposing to do with them in that period? It is proposing to put them all through a re&hyphen;recognition process, regardless of how good they are, regardless of how professionally they operate, regardless of whatever benefits they are delivering to their organisations and regardless of how much more work they have to perform in the interests not just of their people but also of other stakeholders in the process. The government is saying that each and every one of them has to go through a re&hyphen;recognition process at the whim of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we are concerned, this is not just accountability cleansing. We are concerned that the government's agenda here is political cleansing, and it is something that we are not prepared to give a blank cheque to. Have your accountability, but I ask the committee to give me the name of one organisation or one sector in the Australian community that would accept a government&hyphen;imposed regime of control of re&hyphen;recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is asking for a blank cheque to re&hyphen;recognise all the rep bodies at the whim of the minister. That is something that we should not be doing. No migrant group in the country in receipt of government resources or otherwise would cop it; no business group would cop it; the NRMA would not cop it; but you are saying, `Well, let's have a re&hyphen;recognition process and, at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute discretion of the minister, whomever we want to re&hyphen;recognise, we do so.' That should not be on, in any sense of democratic working of this parliament. I am concerned that the government has shown right from the start a propensity to try to silence its critics in this particular area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In all areas, Senator Woodley. Right from the start, when it came to Aboriginal affairs, the weapons were out and the measures were out. The government lost a couple of court cases; they have been proven to have run a fear campaign with respect to resources that have been improperly accounted for in the Aboriginal sector. We can remember the claims of the minister of hundreds of millions of dollars being wasted&mdash;that has not come to fruition. But if any sector has to be concerned about a degree of political cleansing, it is this one. I do not think this parliament should embark upon a proposal of re&hyphen;recognition at the whim of the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from those concerns, we have concerns that scarce resources will be diverted to try to meet an unnecessary process in most circumstances. Functions will not be performed, critical new functions will not be able to be addressed and indigenous Australians will not have any certainty as to who their representatives will be. State and territory governments, mining companies and developers will not be assured of who is going to be representing the other side. The uncertainty ensured by Senator Minchin's proposal will last for a good 12 months, if not 24.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that there is a better regime. That better regime involves giving the minister the power to deregister at the end of the day and ensuring that accountability takes place. Direct accountability should be through ATSIC, particularly in respect of the ongoing accountability and in respect of a de&hyphen;recognition process. What we say is that, instead of putting all representative bodies through a process at the start, within 12 months of the commencement of the act, ATSIC shall determine whether any representative body is not working satisfactorily. It ATSIC so determines, it shall advise the representative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9999"> body and the minister&mdash;the minister is to be informed all the way through&mdash;and may specify another 12&hyphen;month period for the representative body to get its act into order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of that probation period&mdash;I suppose that that is what we can call it&mdash;ATSIC will determine whether the body should be de&hyphen;recognised. If ATSIC does, it may recommend to the minister that he exercise his powers of de&hyphen;recognition granted by our proposed section 203AH(2). This will ensure that we do not go embarking upon a wasteful exercise of dragging well&hyphen;operating representative bodies into a re&hyphen;recognition process but that we can focus on where the problems may very well be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of focusing on those problems, what is really important is putting in place ongoing accountability mechanisms. They exist through, for instance, the minister having the right to seek further information, the minister having discretion to register a representative body, a detailed accountability regime, as in clause 203AH, and the withdrawal of recognition potential. Procedural requirements are very critical in this respect. We are recommending procedural requirements on the minister's exercise of his functions, including ADJR and performance criteria. These measures build on the measures proposed by the government which require representative bodies to have strategic plans, proper accounts records, annual reports, financial statements and so on. We also believe that ATSIC should be the first port of call in respect of appointing auditors and investigators of a representative body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think our approach provides a balance. It is a constructive alternative that does not have the downside in terms of resource implications and political silencing that the government's proposal has. In specifics, we have an up&hyphen;front cleansing process, as I mentioned a little earlier, in terms of accountability and performance. Amendments Nos 318 and 319 ensure that the minister can consider a reduction of area and the withdrawal of recognition when ATSIC has declined a certified body. Amendment No. 306 ensures the deletion of the re-recognition process. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the transfer of documents is important. We also think there needs to be some protection in respect of the transfer of documents. Our amendment No. 312 prevents the transfer of documents from an old representative body to a new body where the documents are the subject of legal professional privilege, copyright or, importantly, are owned by a third person in accordance with traditional law and custom. They cannot be passed on without the consent of that relevant person. I do not think we should underestimate that provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 309, 322 and 334 ensure that representative bodies have to meet certain benchmarks in terms of protecting the interests of native title holders. They must consult with them in respect of on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground matters, such as environmental and land management issues and so on. There is a tricky issue in respect of conflicts of interest. This is one that representative bodies often have to contend with. Our amendment essentially allows representative bodies to continue to act except where a representative body is satisfied that it is not able to resolve a dispute or cannot adequately or efficiently provide the assistance required. There has to be a balance here, given the lack of access by individuals to alternative forms of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a facilitation and assistance function that we ensure the representative bodies are capable of performing. Basically, it is on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground support. There is a certification and notification function in terms of many of the claims lodged by claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finance and accountability has been an issue of public concern. There needs to be accountability, but we also need to ensure that it is balanced by a degree of self-determination. The public needs to have confidence that the process of accountability is transparent. What we say in that respect is that we demand strategic three-year plans. We need to make sure that funding is provided for the period of the representative bodies' strategic plan; we do that in amendment No. 335. We also ensure that ATSIC determines the period of the strategic plan, not the minister; that is important in terms of self-determination. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10000"> strategic plans are to be subject to the approval of ATSIC, not the Commonwealth minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of direct accountability under amendment No. 340, we propose that representative bodies inform ATSIC, in the immediate sense, not the minister, of matters which quite significantly affect the achievement of objectives set out in the strategic plan. We have provisions for annual reports and for financial statements to both ATSIC and the minister and to parliament. Amendment No. 344 ensures that representative bodies' annual reports and statements provided to ATSIC must in turn be provided to the minister for tabling in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is in the picture. Amendments Nos 345 and 347 require ATSIC to inform the minister where there have been serious and repeated irregularities in the financial affairs of the representative bodies. Amendments Nos 348 and 349 ensure that ATSIC must comply with a request by the minister for certain information, except in those circumstances I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been public concern. Some of it has been unfairly beaten up by politicians wishing to take some advantage in this area. There has been some public concern about accountability. It is a legitimate thing for the public and the parliament to be concerned about. The measures proposed by the government, built upon by us and the indigenous working groups, build very much a basis for engendering public confidence in the process. But you will not have public confidence in the process if you allow, at the whim of a minister, all sorts of interference all the way through the process, starting with re&hyphen;recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wasteful and laden with dangers. Once again, this is another area where the government is going far in excess of what the Wik decision justifies. Of course, it goes to issues of public concern. Once again, it tilts that balance much more unfairly against indigenous Australians. My plea is to put in place further accountability but also to allow indigenous Australians and their representatives to operate with a degree of self-determination and, most importantly through that, a degree of self-dignity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other representative body in this country has had this sort of proposal put to them in terms of controlling their day-to-day operations and, in fact, controlling their existence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now debating the topic area 19 `Representative bodies'. Part 11 of the Native Title Act established in 1994 a system of representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies. Part 11 of the act contains two rather short sections; namely, sections 202 and 203. The government amendments concerning representative bodies now form an entire schedule in the amendment bill and run for 54 pages. I think what Senator Bolkus has just been saying is supported by that alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulties which have occurred concerning the overlapping of claims have, to a great extent, been caused by a legacy of dispossession and the stolen generations. I put on the table a lot of evidence of that in the previous debate. The major defect in these provisions is the attempt by the government to undertake a wholesale review of all indigenous representative bodies in Australia. This is totally unnecessary and will cause extraordinary disruption to those representative bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of questions for the minister. Firstly, if the government succeeds in what it is trying to do with its amendments, will the minister be providing additional funding to representative bodies for the proposed review process and, if so, how much will be allocated to the representative bodies? Where the minister has particular and legitimate concerns about the performance of a representative body, there are ample powers in the bill which would allow him to take steps to cure the situation. These powers are both desirable and appropriate. Although it appears that the government reconsidered some of its earlier excessive proposals in relation to accountability, there are still layers of so-called accountability which are unnecessary, will impair the proper functioning of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10001"> representative bodies and are likely to be counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to look at what generates this notion of making sure these `black fellas' are held accountable. Is it that indigenous institutions or bodies have a higher level of corruption or is it that it serves a particular political agenda to perpetuate the myth that they are corrupt? It is so much easier to treat people differently, particularly people with a different skin colour, if you can perpetuate the myth that they are more prone to criminal activity. I wonder if the minister could answer that. Does he really believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more prone to criminal activity? If not, then why place a more onerous accountability provision on their representative bodies? The so-called accountability provisions could perhaps be more accurately described as stereotyping provisions, because that is what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why get rid of the existing representative bodies? Does the minister really believe that all of them have failed in  their task? It is clear to us that the appropriate accountability principles are: first, representative bodies must be accountable for the use of public moneys; secondly, representative bodies should be accountable internally, actively and directly to their constituents; and, thirdly, representative bodies are already subject to adequate accountability arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the proposed financial and accountability amendments should not duplicate ATSIC and other financial and accountability arrangements for representative bodies which are already in place, be oppressive and so detract from accountability and performance, and place significant control and involvement in relation to representative bodies in the hands of the minister, which is highly inappropriate given the Commonwealth's interests and participation in native title matters. Clearly, a conflict of interest is apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently there are representative bodies for most areas of Australia. It is appropriate that there is one representative body for each area. Of all the amendments in this bill&mdash;and, let's face it, many of them are paternalistic&mdash;this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach regarding representative bodies is perhaps the most paternalistic of them all. We should never forget that it was the underpinning paternalism that created the environment whereby indigenous children were stolen from their families because `it was seen to be good for them'. We should be ever vigilant not to repeat those mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern to the Australian Democrats is the growing trend of governments in this country to establish self-fulfilling prophecies with regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies. The scenario goes something like this: `Okay, you want self-determination. We&mdash;and by that I mean non-indigenous Australia&mdash;will establish bodies such as ATSIC. But then we will defund them. Of course, we'll blame you when the mess that we created, such as the still appalling health standards, is not given an instant solution.' It is called responsibility shifting. We believe that the government's amendments not only are reflective of responsibility shifting but also are intrinsically paternalistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is consensus that representative bodies need to play a more active and integral role in the native title claim process, and that is rightly so. They will, however, be undercut and set up to fail if they are not appropriately resourced. Then we will be faced with another government in the not too distant future saying, `Look, native title is unworkable. Native title representative bodies are not doing their job. What we need is certainty.' And thrown in for good measure will be a couple of furphies about people's backyards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, are you really serious about assisting indigenous people in making native title claims? We trust that somehow or other we can get support for the amendments which have been proposed by the opposition parties. We certainly are committed to accountability. That is absolutely essential. We certainly are committed to having representative bodies that are the appropriate auspices for sorting out many of the disputes. They know their own people and they are on the ground and can hear the different sides of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that there have been problems with the way in which representative bodies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10002"> are operated. We would say that most of those problems originate from the lack of resources and the lack of clarity in the legislation. Let us make sure that representative bodies are accountable. Let us make sure that they can operate. Let us make sure that they are resourced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to Senator Woodley. For a Christian man he is very quick to attribute ill motive to everything the government does, which I find offensive. He is basically accusing me and the government of holding the view that Aboriginal people are more prone to criminal activity. It is really an outrageous proposition and utterly offensive and, I would have thought, should play no part in this sort of debate. You would think from what you have been saying that we are abolishing all representative bodies and taking away all their funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are effectively implementing the Keating government's 1995 review of representative bodies&mdash;a review largely conducted by Aboriginal people&mdash;which called for higher standards and one body per area. You have described us as being paternalistic for implementing what Aboriginal people on the 1995 review conducted by the Keating government recommended we do. This is where you become so warped in your views about the coalition government. You think that everything we do is racist and everything else. Let us have some clear thinking here and treat our propositions on their merits. Sure, you can disagree with those that you think are wrong, but please can we be spared the accusations that everything we do is based on some view that all Aboriginals are criminals, for God's sake!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the resources, the current funding is some $40 million. That will continue. If ATSIC believes additional funding is required then that is a matter for ATSIC 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> either out of its own budget or to seek additional funding through the normal processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue of re&hyphen;recognition, we think on balance, is the proper way to go. If you are going to have a mechanism by which you can establish designated rep body areas and one rep body per area then the way we are approaching it will facilitate that. You will be able to determine the appropriate rep body for the area designated, operate such a system accordingly and ensure that the rep bodies meet the new standards which we are putting in place as a result of that 1995 review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems entirely appropriate to require existing rep bodies to satisfy everybody they can to meet those standards. If they can then they will have no difficulty being re&hyphen;recognised. They are given full priority in the re&hyphen;recognition process. If they are performing their functions appropriately then there will be no difficulty in re&hyphen;recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think to make this system work you do need this transition period to enable the identification of rep body areas and to enable existing rep bodies to apply for representative body status in respect of the area for which they wish to be a rep body. If they meet the standards then they will be recognised. The minister's decision is not on a whim and a prayer. He has to comply with or make his decision in accordance with the criteria laid down in the act and any decision is a disallowable instrument. It is governed by quite strict criteria. It is not just a whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We continue to assert that re-recognition is appropriate. These bodies have the status of a representative body and, therefore, receive Commonwealth funding and exercise powers and functions under a Commonwealth act of parliament and should be required to demonstrate that they can meet those appropriate standards laid down in the act. That is quite proper procedure in respect of any body that is exercising powers and functions under an act and receiving Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not affect their other status. Most of these bodies are the land councils. It is their additional recognition as a representative body for the purposes of the Native Title Act we are talking about. They will continue to exercise all their functions. I am sure all the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10003"> land councils that are current rep bodies that can meet these standards will be re&hyphen;recognised. We think there is somewhat unduly dramatic condemnation of this process which does not meet with the reality of the need to ensure that we have properly accountable rep bodies operating in all these areas. Priority is given to the existing rep bodies. We think it is sensible to have a 12&hyphen;month transition process to enable the determination of areas and appropriate bodies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paternalistic, why is it that the government wants to deregister all of the representative bodies? If it is not paternalistic, why is it that the current accountability, the very onerous accountability, regime which Aboriginal and Islander bodies have is still seen to be not strict enough, that a more onerous accountability provision, even more onerous than is presently in place, has to be placed on representative bodies? That is the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no use saying, `Good God, do you think we are accusing Aboriginal people of criminal activity?'

I honestly accept your assurance that that is not your starting point. I can understand why you reacted, but you have to understand how people who feel that they are being made more accountable than anybody else in the community have to wonder why that is so. So that is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reference you made to my being a Christian&mdash;so somehow or other that means that I, therefore, should not point out to the government when I believe it is stereotyping and stigmatising people&mdash;just does not hold up. I do not want to go back over the church and state debate, but let me underline that one of the fundamental obligations laid upon Christians is that they speak the word to the governments of the day, a contemporary word. Where that word must be a prophetic word, then it has to be. That is the absolute tradition of the prophetic stream in both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures. So I reject that implication, but I guess that is a debate that we can have at another time. I simply respond to the minister in that way, but I do accept and understand his reaction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded of the replayed program on the SBS a couple of nights ago called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Eyed</EMPHASIS> . It was about people in a workshop who found what it was like to be required to live down to other people's expectations. That is what we are seeing here. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10005"> It has been a process since the 1980s when there were talks of treaties, sovereignty and self&hyphen;determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, whether it is ATSIC or the rep bodies, the most important area of accountability is to the people they represent. Unfortunately, over time and in particular with this government, it has forgotten that ATSIC and the rep bodies are in fact primarily required to be responsible to their constituents. Instead of concentrating on that, what the government has done is insist that their primary responsibility is to take direction from the government. It will require extra duties of the rep bodies if this legislation goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was trying to work out how many dollars per claimant will be available to establish claims. Considering the cost of lodging claims, it is not going to be very much. It would be far less than $100. I would have thought it would be roughly about $50 per person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all these extra requirements of the rep bodies, as Senator Bolkus has mentioned, I am concerned that you also have the situation of rep bodies having to fight for their very existence. The issues are about accountability to the people that rep bodies represent. I believe that government over time has helped to create some of those problems. It is well overdue that governments and the Australian government should ask the members, those people who are served or represented by rep bodies in Australia, to find out how best the rep bodies themselves can meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that a little while back the Central Land Council put forward some potential models for decentralisation: methods of using resources or making resources available and allowing the local groups and local clans who were running claims to be in control. Those kinds of models could be discussed widely. I believe the government has a role to enable that level of accountability&mdash;that level of response to the members and constituents which both ATSIC and the rep bodies are serving&mdash;to flourish. Instead, the government is insisting that more and more onerous conditions be imposed and, as I have mentioned, that the bodies themselves fight for their sheer existence instead of being able to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concentrate on the many different jobs, roles and responsibilities that they have been loaded with as a result of these kinds of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It puts the onus on the minister. I have seen examples, for instance, with ATSIC where there is a very small amount of decision making left with the representatives. When a decision is finally made between all the members of the groups represented by ATSIC, the minister says, `No,' and they wonder what it was all about. Those kinds of things are very disheartening, very disempowering and constantly wear down the ability of people to have confidence in the bodies that represent them because they have been given no ability to make decisions on their behalf. I think that is what we and the government should be concentrating on: real self&hyphen;determination, sovereignty issues and enabling those changes which will enable those rep bodies to be thoroughly accountable to their constituents, not to us.</PARA></SPEECH>

The total expenditure on rep bodies over the four years 1994&hyphen;95 to 1997&hyphen;98 is $133 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rep bodies are there to service native title claimants. We are on about native title claimants getting the best possible service to facilitate their claims and to facilitate recognition of their common law native title. The rep bodies are not the end in themselves; they are the means to the end. The parliament has a right to ensure that those rep bodies meet the appropriate standards in servicing native title claimants and holders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think recognition of current bodies is an appropriate procedure to go through, particularly when you are agreeing to the proposition that there be only one rep body per area&mdash;a very sensible suggestion, I would have thought. But, given that the rep body then has a monopoly in that area, you must be seen to be ensuring that that representative body is a properly accountable body&mdash;accountable for the funds it receives from the Australian taxpayers and accountable to its clients, the native title holders. Given the quite significant powers and functions which the bill gives to rep bodies, they must be seen to be able to perform those functions according to higher standards. As I say, their authority and their capacity to perform their functions can only be enhanced if they go through this re-recognition process and, at the end of the 12 months, are recognised under the new scheme. That can only enhance their authority and their capacity to perform the quite considerable powers and functions which are given to them under the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It sounds reasonable, Senator Minchin, but we all know that the provisions have heaps of poison in them, and that is what I would like to focus on. You try to argue that the empowering provision of the minister is a normal one in terms of the minister's capacity to deregister or not to re&hyphen;recognise. But it is so broad that the minister can take anything into account. Where you have two competing bodies, a new one and an old one, there is no real recognition given in those criteria for an exercise of discretion relating to the ongoing work done by a particular body. You might say that there is indirectly but, as I say, the breadth of the power is something which really gives the minister a blank cheque.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are lots of provisions that are of concern but one in particular is your last&hyphen;minute amendment No. 85, which is on page 15 of your amendments. This is the provision relating to `access to information'. It is an extraordinary provision. We all agree that there should be strong provisions to ensure financial accountability; that is, capacity to inspect accounts, records and so on. This particular provision&mdash;I raise this as a matter of grave concern&mdash;is such that it allows a person to be appointed by the minister. It then allows that person to have full and free access to documents relating to a rep body and to make copies of, or take extracts from, any such document. That person may also require a rep body to answer questions, to produce documents in a rep body's possession, and so on. The amendment goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A representative body must produce a document or record or disclose information as required under paragraph 1(c), whether or not the document, record or information is the subject of legal professional privilege.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us take into account that rep bodies quite often find themselves in legal proceedings with government, particularly with the Commonwealth government. We often have an adversarial situation. This power is so broad that it would demand the production of documents, regardless of legal professional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10007"> privilege. The amendment then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A document, record or information does not cease to be the subject of legal professional privilege merely because it is produced under paragraph 1(c).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a great saving grace if one is in court against the government, and the government has access to all the documentation of the other side in the legal proceedings. If the rep body does not comply, it is guilty `of an offence punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units'. Then there is a subsection about self-incrimination which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not a reasonable excuse for a representative body to refuse or fail:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to give information; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to produce a record or document;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the ground that the information or the production of the document or record, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate the representative body or make the representative body liable to a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then you have the provision that the information is not available in criminal proceedings unless it is in respect of proceedings under subsection (4), which is failure to comply, or subsection (7), which relates to producing false or misleading material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are embarking on very dangerous ground, because those two provisions do not really give the protection that most Australians expect and deserve under our general criminal law or under our legal principles. We basically have a situation where a rep body, quite often in dispute with government, is going to have its legal professional privilege stripped away from it and has to produce documentation. This amendment also makes inroads on the self-incrimination provisions. That in itself is bad enough. But what protection do rep bodies have if they are in legal proceedings as against the Crown? As I say, this is a last-minute amendment which was sold as an olive branch to indigenous Australians. But it is more like a crown of thorns, isn't it?</PARA></SPEECH>

So yes, as is currently the case in relation to ATSIC audits, the auditors can have access to those documents, but that is the end of it. They cannot report on them or provide those documents or allow those documents to be used in any other respect which, as I understand it, is not a limitation placed there in relation to existing ATSIC Act audits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to Senator Bolkus. He does, I think, bring out very lucidly the whole problem of the minister, in effect, being the quality controller of the representative groups. Irrespective of whether the information that is obtained can be used in a court case or a dispute with the representative bodies and the government, it is quite clear that a minister of the government, in dispute with a representative body, has the power to withdraw its recognition at any stage&mdash;whether he does it properly or not, there is an appearance that there will be bias on behalf of the Crown or that the parties are not on an equal footing when a minister in one of the parties can withdraw the recognition of the other party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To follow on from what Senator Bolkus was saying, 203DF(1) does not apply simply

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister is ultimately responsible for ensuring that representative bodies created under the act and in receipt of, as I say, $133 million over the last four years are adequately performing their functions. It is his responsibility to the parliament and the people of Australia to ensure adequate performance of the functions and the exercise of the considerable statutory powers granted to rep bodies under this act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, I would love to have that kind of authority in relation to Senator Bolkus's performance, but unfortunately the parliament is unlikely to grant it. I do find that a most peculiar analogy between a member of parliament duly elected by the people of South Australia in the form of Senator Bolkus and a body which is granted the considerable authority and status of a representative body for the purposes of the Native Title Act. We are talking about its status as a representative body. The body itself, of course, is not affected by this. It is whether, under the Native Title Act, it maintains the authority, the powers and the functions vested in representative bodies by this act and its right to receive considerable funding from the taxpayer to perform those functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are saying is that ultimately there should be that capacity to exercise the responsibility of the minister in an appropriate way. Unless the minister can ultimately have such an investigation done in the circumstances set out in paragraph (2), then ultimately it constrains the minister's capacity to properly exercise his responsibility in respect of representative bodies who again, as I say, by this act are granted considerable authority, powers and of course funds under the scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The regime the government is adopting, and that in fact the opposition is building on, is one where the minister does have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> power to seek further information under one of our provisions, and is being supplied by ATSIC with accounting information, with a whole raft of information. There is an obligation on ATSIC to ensure the minister is kept informed of serious and regular breaches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what this debate is really about is an example of the conflict situation you fall into when you do not give ATSIC a meaningful role in this accountability regime. This is just one example, and we could probably spend the rest of the week going through example after example of the sorts of things that will happen if you do not have a distance between the minister and the rep bodies&mdash;some third arm that is in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self&hyphen;determination principles are important, but this conflict of interest principle is also important&mdash;and it raises its head continually in terms of some of the powers the minister will have over rep bodies. Senator Cooney mentioned one, and we have mentioned this particular legal professional privilege, but there are many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure that we are suggesting is one that I think really overcomes these problems in that the first port of call, in terms of the ongoing responsibility to deregister, to make it accountable and to ensure that the minister is informed, is ATSIC&mdash;although the minister does have overriding power to deregister and to demand information. Basically, we are saying that when you start moving from a degree of self&hyphen;determination these conflict issues will always continue to arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I think we have proved over the last hour or so, people are being treated in a way different from any other representative group in our community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Harradine that the reason why the opposition has proposed this amendment is that it is different from the previous debate we had. Here we are talking about the transfer of documentation from one representative body to another&mdash;one organisation to another&mdash;as opposed to the transfer from a representative body to the Crown. In those circumstances, we felt the need for an amendment, further to the previous one that we discussed, to ensure protection of copyright.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it: copyright is a fairly critical issue in indigenous communities&mdash;the knowledge as to custom, traditional law and also privilege. The situation is somewhat different from transferring information from a representative body to the Crown&mdash;the point we made earlier. There are many circumstances where there may be disputes as to the ownership of a particular copyright. Those disputes may in fact be at law, and they may involve different individual indigenous Australians, for instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one case that comes to mind very quickly as to why we should have the three legs of this particular exemption or protection clause. We acknowledge that the consent of a third person can be given, but that third person should not be a victim, for instance, of a lack of protection with respect to privilege or copyright.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to get it clear from the government. In amendment 203FC(1)(c)(i), the words are `but only with the consent of the owners of the documents and records'. Is the minister saying that those words qualify sufficiently the ability of the Commonwealth to direct such that the former representative body need not provide documents, as covered by Senator Bolkus's amendment? In other words, are you saying that those words, particularly in respect of documents or knowledge owned according to traditional law and custom by a third person, cover the proposition that has been put forward by Senator Bolkus? What is really the problem with Senator Bolkus's amendment? Is there some problem with regard to documents of legal professional privilege or copyright?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. Minister, I refer you to the government's launch last week of a code of conduct for government departments wishing to use electronic smart cards. Given that Centrelink has indicated that it is actively looking at smart card applications in the social security area, why is the code of conduct only voluntary? What guarantees can you offer Centrelink clients that personal information acquired by smart card operators will not be misused? What sanctions will exist to deter and punish the misuse of smart card data?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Collins, this is an issue which the government takes very seriously. The Asia-Pacific Smart Card Forum's smart card code of conduct was launched by the Attorney-General on 27 November and that is for adherence by the private sector organisation signatories. Any smart card schemes which are developed by the government will be covered by the Privacy Act 1988 and any specific legislative and confidentiality requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centrelink is applying a wide consultative approach in the development of its smart card schemes. A request for information issued recently to industry was also forwarded to privacy advocates for comments and a privacy advocates' workshop is planned for January. Discussions by Centrelink with the Privacy Commissioner and the community groups are in process and a privacy framework is to be developed after these consultations to alleviate concerns that government advocates and the Australian public may have about the utilisation of the new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly not the government's intention that smart cards will become a de facto Australia Card, as has been suggested by at least one commentator, and safeguarding individual privacy will be a vitally important element in Centrelink's development of proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, the Ernest Henry mine, a $310 million mine near Cloncurry in my electorate, was officially opened by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, on 22 October this year. Could you explain how an Aboriginal group that was formed in mid&hyphen;1996 can now seek a Federal Court injunction to stop an operating mine? Does this precedent mean that there is no certainty associated with any project involving native title claims even after they have been approved?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="10020" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator MacGibbon for that question. If any further example were needed of the legal and practical unworkability of the previous Labor government's failed native title legislation, then this would be it. The Federal Court application of the Mitakoodi Juhnjlar people seeks to have the Ernest Henry mine leases declared invalid; it seeks to restrain the Ernest Henry mine from continuing to operate; and it seeks unspecified compensation and damages. The Ernest Henry mine is a $310 million project opened, as Senator MacGibbon said, only six weeks ago. The operation covers 14 separate mining leases, some of which were granted or renewed prior to the Wik decision or to the Mitakoodi native title claim, and some of which were renewed after the Wik decision on the basis they were legally enforceable rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ernest Henry joint venturers have had a positive and rewarding relationship with the local Aboriginal community through their peak body, the Koutha Aboriginal Development Corporation. Over 100 Aborigines worked on the mine construction. The permanent work force includes a significant number of Aborigines, and Koutha itself is a joint venturer in the mine trucking contract worth $3 million a year. It is an example of the type of amicable, freely negotiated agreements between miners and Aboriginal communities of which I informed the Senate last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mitakoodi group was unheard of when these arrangements were initiated and it has since refused to join the Koutha group. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Instead, it has attempted to extract $120 million from the mine owners in return for ensuring no native title interference with the mine site, its power or water supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will recall the involvement of Mr `15 per cent' Charlie Perkins in that little $120 million extortion attempt. This latest court action is yet another ridiculous demand made possible by the Labor Party's legacy of confusion and uncertainty which invites litigation by unproven and unrepresentative native title claimants. It is a legacy which the ALP still refuses to acknowledge, and it still refuses to support the Howard government's plan to restore a system which is fair and equitable to all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why won't the Labor Party support the validation of mining titles entered into in good faith before the Wik decision? Do they want not just the Ernest Henry leases but thousands of other mining leases, pastoral leases and other tenements to be thrown into further doubt and confusion? Why won't the Labor Party not support the government in implementing the agreement with the Koutha corporation and the business opportunities, the employment and training for local Aborigines which the Ernest Henry mine provides?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only answer is that the ALP continues to put politics before good policy. They stick their heads in the sand and they refuse to acknowledge the mess which they created. They do not care about lost investment. They do not care about lost opportunities. They do not care about regional Australia and lost jobs. It is, as I said the other day, a shameful Labor legacy.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With pleasure. Certainly, benefits are starting to flow to the Australian community from good economic management. They always do. That is why we adopted sound economic policies in contrast to our predecessors, the previous Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may have noticed the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry comments yesterday in its survey of business

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These results provide confirmation that the actions taken by the Government to lower the deficit through cuts to expenditure are paying dividends. The structural changes have improved our economic fundamentals and restored competitiveness. They have given the economy an underlying strength it has not had for many years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not surprisingly, therefore, today we have building approvals rising by 3.7 per cent in October to be 4.6 per cent higher over the year, and retail sales are 5.1 per cent higher over the year as well. That is good news not only for those industries but for all the community that benefits from the flow down of those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, as we have said before, the government of record low interest rates, record low inflation, rising consumer confidence and strong business investment. Perhaps there is no better example than the car industry. We announced on 5 June a package for the car industry which would protect jobs and grow the industry. I am pleased to say that the car industry has responded positively. There has been a commitment of massive investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Toyota decided in August to invest $1 billion with the creation of hundreds of jobs and expected tripling of exports by the year 2005. Mitsubishi from my own state has confirmed a marked increase in employment this year following the release of its new model and strong growth in exports. Ford has confirmed that it will slash new car prices next year for the first time in memory because of increased competition in the Australian market and the expected slow&hyphen;down of the Asian economy. So we are able to meet the competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is further good news today: South Australian car component maker Britax Rainsfords has won a $115 million, five-year contract to supply rear vision mirrors to the United States, lifting company exports by 30 per cent and creating another 30 direct jobs and a similar number in the supplier, transport and packaging industries.

It is true that he is not a member of the professional organisation to which you refer. That is correct. But, of course, the acid sulfate plan was approved by QASSIT, the body that had the responsibility in relation to approving the plan for acid sulfate monitoring. I think you will come clean and tell the Senate that QASSIT is made up of professionals who are members of that association. Isn't that correct, Senator? If you do so, that will put that little one to rest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the site is subject to testing by a site supervisor as well. So, in fact, we have three levels of supervision here on acid sulfate: the site monitor, who I understand is the site supervisor, who takes daily readings; QASSIT, who had to approve the plan and who have the professional qualifications to which you specifically refer; and the overall independent monitor, Professor Saenger, whom I had never heard criticised by anyone until I read that press release by that particular professional organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction we make between this project and so many others that have occurred in the last decade up the Queensland coast is that this project does have an acid sulfate plan that not only had to be approved by QASSIT, properly qualified people, but also went out for examination by two independent authori

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to addressing the issue of foreign debt is the need for Australians to lift their own savings performance. Everyone will know that national savings under Labor collapsed. No&hyphen;one would argue with that. The imbalance between saving and investment meant that Australians had to rely more heavily on the savings of foreigners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a central feature of this government's policy that we are trying to lift national savings. One of the ways we have done this is to tackle the issue of the massive deficits which Labor left us&mdash;$70 billion from their last five years in office. Senator Cook shakes his head, but he was a senior minister in that government. Senator Cook should know particularly well that the previous government collapsed national savings essentially through running up major deficits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing we have done for national savings is to tackle the issue of the deficit. It is well known that the forward estimates show that this budget will be running into a surplus by the time we finish this term of government. We have made a major attack on the problem of national savings. Equally, we are giving quite a degree of emphasis to things like the savings rebate to encourage private savings, as you will be aware, Senator Murray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had an occasion before in this parliament to mention that, in the last year to 30 June, it was a super year for super. I do not think anyone would argue with that. Senator Cook and his colleagues constantly argued that confidence was collapsing in superannuation. That is not the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Lightfoot for the question. This is an important initiative of the government which will be coming into effect next year. It is one which has been called for for a number of years by the major welfare organisations, but of course the Labor government was not prepared to listen. It is an important social policy reform which affects young Australians. The income support arrangements for young people that we inherited from Labor was another good example of how Labor says one thing but does another. For all its talk about the importance of education and training, we inherited a system from Labor which promoted the opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, young people got more on the dole than for education or training. We are going to change that. Statistics show why it is so important that we do that. Currently, some 560,000 young people receive some form of income support. Four hundred and sixteen thousand are students aged between 16 and 25 and 144,000 are unemployed young people aged between 16 and 21. The youth allowance will bring significant benefits to the vast majority of young Australians. Three hundred and sixty&hyphen;eight thousand will receive the same money as they currently do; 153,000 will receive more money than they currently do; 33,250 will receive a reduced amount; and 12,800 young people who are unemployed will no longer be eligible for payment because their parents are well off. Sixteen hundred youth training allowance recipients will not be eligible as they will not choose to return to educational training. Around two&hyphen;thirds of young unemployed people will not have their payments affected by the introduction of a parental means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance is important because it treats all young people in similar circumstances more fairly. It removes the illogical disincentives for young people to go on to further education or training. Despite Labor's rhetoric in their platform, they left us with a system which encouraged young people to choose the dole over education or training. Young people getting Austudy were means 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10031"> tested; people of the same age on the dole were not. Surely that is unacceptable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be some of the immediate benefits of the youth allowance? For starters, young people will benefit from having a system of income support which is easier to understand and from not having to change between payments as their circumstances or activities change because of sickness, full&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;time study or jobsearch. One payment will cover all circumstances, making it easier for young people to understand their entitlements and helping them make better decisions about their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seventy thousand students will qualify for rent assistance for the first time if they have to live away from home; 17,000 students will benefit from more lenient criteria for the assessment of whether they are independent than currently apply under Austudy; and 41,000 young people will gain from the abolition of the requirement for a minimum Austudy entitlement of $1,000 a year. Young people under 18 who are living away from home will receive a higher rate of payment than at present. Rent assistance will also be available, including for young people exempted from the requirement to be studying or be in training. All students will now have access to the $500 loan advance currently available under newstart, and the pharmaceutical allowance. They will also be eligible for remote area allowance. There are exemptions for young people in particularly difficult situations such as homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the Senate's attention that this is inevitably going to be a better and fairer system for young people and all Australians. It is one which all political parties should endorse.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tainting of a company's share capital account with profits does not in itself create a tax revenue loss. It is the subsequent distribution from the company's tainted share capital account that could create a tax revenue loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies may have an incentive to disguise a return of profits as a return of capital because of the fact that distributions of capital are generally taxed more favourably in a shareholder's hands than profits distributed as unfranked dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is especially true for shareholders holding shares acquired before the introduction of capital gains tax, for whom capital distributions are tax-free. Even where shareholders hold shares that are subject to capital gains tax, the tax on the distribution can be deferred and the shareholders may have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10032"> advantages associated with indexation and averaging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, if a company taints its share capital account by transferring profits into that account, the potential maximum revenue loss from subsequent distributions from that account is the difference between tax paid on a distribution as a return of capital (which could be zero) and tax payable on a dividend of the same amount received by a shareholder on the top marginal tax rate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10032"><TITLE>Indonesia and Thailand: IMF Assistance</TITLE>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Mackay asked Senator Kemp to speak to the proposition that the Reserve Bank had seen cause to intervene in a Transport Workers Union claim because it offended against a band of inflation increases that the Reserve Bank had promulgated, but did not interfere in the salary package negotiated by senior officers of the Department of Finance and Public Administration for pay rises well outside that band. It was a question that pointed to the hypocrisy of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Senator Kemp did not answer that question. He just described the salary package without going to the point of the question. Once again, in a way which avoided the nub of the serious issues, he then tried to attack the Labor opposition on that point. This is not the first nor the last time that we harry the government on its inconsistencies about industrial relations, and, in particular, about the perfidy of this particular minister in dealing so loosely and superficially with his brief.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I particularly want to pay attention to today is the question that Senator Quirke asked Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp has direct responsibilities as Assistant Treasurer and Minister representing the Treasurer in this place on superannuation. This government imposed a 15 per cent tax on superannuation recipients who earn more than $70,000 a year&mdash;that is, on high income earners. However, the way in which they have gone about imposing this new tax&mdash;a tax, I point out, that is in direct breach of the election undertaking by the Treasurer when he was seeking election to the Treasury benches as part of a new government in 1996. He promised not to increase taxes or to extend the existing tax regime at all&mdash;this new tax is a breach of that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tax hits low and middle income earners who are superannuation contributors if they are not able to or do not provide their superannuation funds with their tax file numbers. That is to say, people who are not targets of this tax are having imposed on them an obligation to report their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds in order to escape this tax net. If they do not, through inadvertence or ignorance or through not knowing what their new obligations are, then they will be taxed 15 per cent whether they like it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Quirke referred to the fact that Mr Murray Wyatt, Chairman of the Certified Practising Accountants Superannuation Centre of Excellence, said that the questionnaire that the government has issued will take an accountant three hours to complete and will impose on ordinary people several hundreds of dollars of cost simply to claim they are tax free. To prove you do not have to pay this tax, it will cost you several hundred dollars for a professional accountant, or you will incur that type of cost yourself because you cannot complete the form in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This iniquitous tax will, according to the Taxation Office's own figures, collect from low and middle income earners who average earnings of $35,000 a year&mdash;that is 700,000 people in Australia who the tax office estimates will pay this tax unnecessarily&mdash;$220 million of revenue. Low and middle income 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10034"> earners who do not have to pay this tax, because they cannot escape their liabilities or do not know about them, will contribute an income to the government of $220 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister, the Assistant Treasurer of Australia, cannot answer the question as to what he is going to do to bring tax justice to those individuals. This is a tax on the wealthy but this tax hits at ordinary Australians: the so-called battlers under John Howard's plan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook has just said to the Senate that this is an iniquitous tax; yet this 15 per cent tax that was imposed had the support of the Labor Party at the time it was announced. It had the full support of the opposition because, at the time that the superannuation surcharge was announced in the budget in 1996, the Labor Party knew that when they applied taxes to superannuation they did it in a most unfair manner. When the Labor Party wanted to impose a tax on superannuation&mdash;and you ought to remember they are the first people that actually imposed a tax on contributions&mdash;their idea was that the wealthier you were, the greater advantage you got in putting money into superannuation because you were able to claim a tax deduction at your marginal rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who was responsible for the iniquitous taxing of superannuation? None other than those people who are now criticising this government for trying to put some equity back into the taxation of superannuation arrangements by making sure that those people on higher incomes actually contribute to a larger degree and that it is not possible for them to be able to claim the huge tax breaks that they got as high income earners and high marginal tax rate payers. I am sure that Senator Conroy would even agree&mdash;a man well versed in superannuation&mdash;that at the time of the introduction they supported that those people who were on higher incomes pay a higher rate than those who were on lower incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to quote quite selectively&mdash;which Senator Quirke did. He made a selec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive quote about somebody who had written in and said how much it would cost to fill out a return in order to make sure that somebody did not have to pay the 15 per cent surcharge. I am sure that Senator Cook would also agree that the figures he quoted during his response, in taking note of the question, were hypothetical figures based on low and middle income earners. The scare tactics that were put out by the opposition in regard to the number of people who would supply their tax file numbers, as we found out in estimates, have not proved to be as true as they first thought. They were talking about a 20 and 25 per cent return of tax file numbers from people in superannuation funds and yet we find out that so far the return to this stage is 65 per cent. Sixty&hyphen;five per cent was the figure quoted to us by the department.</PARA>

They also said that, through their other matching data, 65 per cent of the remainder would also not have to pay this surcharge because they had not supplied their tax file number. So for the opposition to get up and talk about an iniquitous tax when in fact they were responsible for the most iniquitous taxation of the superannuation contributions of Australians that has been introduced ever since superannuation became the norm for most Australians is the height of hypocrisy. If you remember, they were the first people to ever charge a contributions tax on people making contributions to superannuation. They were the people who said, `If you are a worker and you want to contribute to superannuation we will take away your initial $3,000 tax deduction and replace it with a $100 rebate.' That is how well they have looked after the workers of Australia, those who want to make a personal contribution to their own financial income in retirement, when in fact they know and have always known that for those people who got into superannuation at a later stage of life there would have to be some supplementation for them ever to be able to be self-sufficient in retirement. </PARA></TALK.START>

They were the inventors of the inequitable situation that we found ourselves in when we came into government, where they had taken away all the rights of workers to claim a deduction, they had had a 15 per cent tax on contributions, and it was not until this government was elected that something was done to put some equity back into the superannuation system by making sure that people on high incomes paid an extra amount above those who were on low marginal tax rates and were low income earners. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We saw Senator Kemp yet again today repeat something that he knows is simply not true. When he made the assertion that the Labor Party did not support a 15 per cent tax with regard to well-off people on superannuation, he knew it to be not true. He knows that the Labor Party voted for the second reading of this bill. Our criticism throughout has not been of the 15 per cent tax; it has been of the complexity of it and the fact that it is going to have a manifestly unfair application to many middle and lower income groups. Therein lies our criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp got up today in that sort of `Boys Own Annual', blustering, anti&hyphen;intellectual, almost submoronic way he answers questions and asserted that the Labor Party did not support this in principle when he knows it to be untrue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ferguson says they do not have to. Senator Ferguson, go back to why we got into this situa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion&mdash;it was the collection method. Why did you adopt this form of collection method that could capture them? Because you just could not confront the fact that this was a tax and not a surcharge. If it was a surcharge, it would have only lasted one or two years. If it is permanent, it is a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because you said certain weasel words before the election&mdash;that you would not increase taxes&mdash;you had to invent the mirage of a surcharge. Once you made it a surcharge, tax and constitutionality meant that you had to go for a very clumsy collection method which in turn has entrapped all these people. You are right, Senator Ferguson&mdash;not one of them has to pay this. I understand that. But it is so complex, and human nature being what it is, we anticipated beforehand a whole range of people would be caught unfairly in this. We have been proven right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have also been proven right about&mdash;the main thrust of the question today, not even bothered to be answered by Senator Kemp&mdash;is that the forms to be filled out are, firstly, complex; secondly, contain errors; and, thirdly, for a lot of people, will require the use of accountants. It will require, by our estimation, up to three hours work. In other words, a lot of people who do not have to pay any of these things may be out of pocket by $200, $300 or $400. That is not particularly fair; that was not the intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got is a principle we all support and an application that very few people in the community support. Guess why they are paying that price? So that the Liberal and National coalition can be politically pure and not be seen to have broken their word. Of course, that scam was done over when the surcharge in legislation became a tax by way of a majority in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does highlight a very serious problem in question time. I have seen good ministers and bad ministers come and go but I have never seen a minister so weak and failing to get across his portfolio as Senator Kemp. I have never seen one. I have some sympathy if the questions tend to be highly technical&mdash;this is a tough area&mdash;but clearly, issues on superannuation or wages policy and the Reserve Bank's relationship to it deserve 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10036"> some answer, not just the `Boys Own Annual' bluster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just that Senator Kemp is getting an extra $50,000 a year to seat&hyphen;warm over there, but the overall cost of supporting him as a minister is close to $1 million. If the same productivity principles which Dr Boxall has developed for the new Department of Finance and Administration were applied to Senator Kemp, he would never get a pay rise. I am going to make a big statement: I think he is the worst one I have ever seen, in 16&half; years in this chamber, occupy a berth on the front bench.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am even more surprised that they would be in the position of criticising a pay increase based on productivity; in other words, better pay for better work. It is absolutely true&mdash;there is no question about it, as I understand it&mdash;that the Department of Finance and Administration has recently released a draft agency agreement to its staff for consideration. But I point out there is no breach whatsoever of the RBA's inflation target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very good reasons for this. One is called productivity. Have you heard of it over there? Do you understand it? There is no breach of the RBA's inflation target. The draft agreement involves an up&hyphen;front lump sum equivalent to 1&half; per cent of salary and two pay increases of three per cent phased in over the 18&hyphen;month life of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department has developed a comprehensive performance management scheme to accompany the introduction of a new broad&hyphen;banded classification structure. This replaces the old semiautomatic pay increment system of salary advancement with a performance based system. Do you understand that? That is what this does. It will enable competent employees to access annual performance bonuses starting at two per cent of salary, and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The draft agreement is consistent with the government's policy parameters for agreement making in the APS which allow for better pay for better work&mdash;something that is pretty foreign to those on the other side of the chamber. The improvements in remuneration are linked to achieved improvements in productivity and performance and therefore are consistent with maintaining low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, we have heard a question from the other side which endeavoured to criticise advancement in the workplace for workers in this country. I often ask the question of those on the other side of the chamber: why do you pretend to represent workers in this country while you so often work to bring them down? Why do you so often endeavour to create a situation where they cannot, by their own endeavour, by their own achievements, by their own initiative, advance their own particular position while at the same time improving the productivity of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most crucial things we need in this nation is an improvement in productivity. Here we have a department going about that with a proposal before it which does that. But the other side does not like it, for some funny,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This superannuation surcharge continues to be one of the most damning pieces of legislation that this government has brought before the chamber. It is a laughing stock in the superannuation industry, it is a laughing stock in the broader community and it is a laughing stock among its own members of the back bench. They know that it is hopeless, inequitable and inefficient. The Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) continues not to listen to anybody, including Senator Ferguson, Senator Watson and Senator McGauran, his government members on the superannuation committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the chamber's attention to the report of the superannuation committee on the recent amendments. I particularly urge members to take the time to read, complex and detailed as it is, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Select Committee on Superannuation hearings on these bills, because it really exposes what a hopeless shambles this legislation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the attention of senators a couple of comments by Sydney lawyer Noel Davis of Clayton Utz. He calculated how much this is going to cost to administer. Here are his sums:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">for the 150,000 small funds, it will cost a minimum of $500 to produce the required 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information for the tax office. That is a total of $175 million. For the large funds, he estimates costs of at least $1 million per fund, or about $100 million, which is just for the 100 largest funds. That is $275 million that members of superannuation funds&mdash;ordinary working people in this country&mdash;are going to have to pay to collect the tax because this government wanted to pull the wool over people's eyes that it was not really a tax but just a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are only projecting, on their best estimates, $500 million this year. It will cost a minimum of $275 million to collect, paid for by ordinary workers in superannuation funds, and it is only going to raise, at best, $500 million. We have already seen all the accountants in this country write to everybody who earns more than $70,000 and say, `If you don't change how you structure your salary package at the moment, you will be hit by this.' So what are they all doing? They are packaging themselves out of the $70,000 limit and avoiding the surcharge tax. So they are not even going to raise the $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Davis predicts that there will be less money raised than it actually costs to implement this bill. Why is this not just unfair and administratively a nightmare but also inequitable? Hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers will pay the extra amount because they will not have supplied their tax file number. The government could not have just implemented it through the group certificate system, the simplest and easiest way to have done it, because that would have been an admission that it was a tax.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell is right; they slugged ordinary workers again. Jacques Martin told the committee that, in its administration of two large industry funds, of its 600,000 members, it has written three letters to every member to try to round up the tax file numbers, and it has only collected 23 per cent of them. That works out at 462,000 ordinary working Australians with incomes less than $70,000 paying the surcharge for the rich. Every one of them will pay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is so stingy that&mdash;this has been revealed in this chamber in the last few

But if the tax office incorrectly collects money from you, this government is so stingy that it will not give you interest on the money that the tax office has been holding which it should never have collected in the first place. That is how stingy this government is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook took note of a question asked of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, by Senator Mackay as well as a question asked by Senator Quirke. I want to concentrate on the answer given by Senator Kemp to Senator Mackay. Before I do, I cannot let this opportunity pass without asking&mdash;rhetorically what on earth Labor is going on about concerning the superannuation tax. On the one hand, Senator Ray is standing up here saying that Labor supports the tax in principle. It appears that the only real criticism of the superannuation tax is the manner in which it is collected. If that is the case, which it certainly seems to be if Senator Ray is to be believed, and who are we to think that he does not have the definitive say for the opposition, what can be fairer than a tax imposed on those who can afford it&mdash;that is, high income earners paying a higher rate of tax than those who do not earn a high income?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has certainly speculated widely on problems that have really not materialised. We have heard Senator Ferguson, who has been a member of the committee, say that the only thing that is needed to solve the problem, if one exists, is for all lower income recipients to supply their tax file numbers. It ought not to be beyond the wit, quite frankly, of any taxpayer who gets 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the bracket of otherwise being liable to pay this tax not only to be able to fill out a necessary form, but also to understand the imperative that in some instances in taxation law they have to supply their tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not reinventing the wheel. This is not something unheard of. This is not something that taxpayers have not heard of. It is really a simple procedure. It is not as if it is something which is so beyond the capacity of most taxpayers to comply with that it really deserves criticism. So here we have unequivocal support in principle for the 15 per cent tax on higher income earners. I think that is game, set and match, quite frankly, on this topic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting back to what Senator Mackay said in relation to Senator Kemp, it seems to me that if the opposition cannot mount a credible criticism of a policy for which Senator Kemp is responsible, all they can do is attack the manner in which he answers questions. How childish! How churlish! How totally unsophisticated for a group of people to attack the manner in which somebody answers questions rather than policy espoused by Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at the certified agreement that has been offered by the Australian Public Service to see that not only does it actually set out to recognise that productivity is an important part of the work force, but also provides encouragement that as part of getting this work force to understand that productivity is a critical part of the sort of policy this government wants to encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the elements of this offer? A one-off 1.25 per cent bonus has been included to compensate for the late commencement of the agreement in the current financial year. The agreement has been cleared by the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business as being within the policy parameters for certified agreements for APS departments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To quote the foreign and trade policy paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the National Interest</EMPHASIS> , changing `relativities of power and influence which flow from the economic rise of East Asia will profoundly influence Australia's foreign and trade policy over the next fifteen years'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond briefly to the ministerial statement. This is the statement of a government which for defence has a champagne appetite on a beer income. It wants to secure a champagne income as well, and that is really what this statement is all about&mdash;just watch the next budget or the budget afterwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extra focus on regional engagements stretching as far as North&hyphen;East Asia where Australia has not fought since the Korean War is designed to support the substantial extra funding for defence which the defence efficiency review foreshadowed but did not justify. It also explains why the government has persistently placed the cart before the horse in its approach to defence. More than halfway through its term, the government has finally produced its strategic paper, yet it produced its defence efficiency review with great promptitude. Surely the strategy could have come first, the detailed management structures later. We know that the government wanted to create the impression of defence efficiency so it could justify the excessive financial demands generated by its warped strategic perspectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about efficiency, even in defence, but, by protecting the defence vote, it has encouraged inefficiency in defence. Any organisation with a protected budget will become inefficient. Defence has done just that. The inshore minehunters, the delays in the new submarine, the hundreds of millions of dollars lost in the over&hyphen;the&hyphen;horizon project are evidence enough of that. Let the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) guarantee an end to these inefficiencies before he comes to the parliament asking for yet more money for defence&mdash;$10 billion a year is more than enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government admits, as has every government for the last 25 years, that Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ia is one of the more secure countries in the world, but is this the strategic statement of a secure country? Does this secure country need to substantially increase defence spending? In fact, this statement bears the characteristic hallmarks of Australian conservative strategic thinking&mdash;if there is no threat, invent one. If you cannot credibly invent one, talk about uncertainty. Do whatever you need to do to support increased defence spending and increased Australian military involvement beyond Australia. Redefine security so that we are not secure, even though we are unless every nasty dictatorship that the government wants to cuddle up to is also secure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that is missing to complete the classical conservative picture is a regional dictatorship in trouble which we can offer to help out with Australian forces, Australian treasury and Australian lives. But the government should remember the outcome of the last such adventure by its predecessors&mdash;Australia, Vietnam, the United States and Cambodia, in different ways, are still paying the price of that piece of adventurism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worthwhile noting in passing the admission in the minister's statement about the US alliance. He says that we will not be depending on allied combat forces, but he freely admits our utter dependence on Washington for resupply and intelligence. So much for self-reliance! With all of these regional pushes further north I wonder how many of those kinds of forays will come out of the defence dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the government's extensive and expensive shopping list. I should congratulate the minister for ruling out acquisition of the Tomahawk land&hyphen;attack cruise missile. Other decisions make it clear that this decision is based solely on cost and not founded on any flash of strategic good sense. This is clear because the minister's grandiose conceptions are all too clear in the rest of his list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He wants us to be a very strong regional maritime power. It might be news to him, but I think we already are. Our naval forces easily outmatch all those in our region. How strong does he propose we get? How much money does he want the taxpayer to pay to fund it? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10052"> How much does he want the rest of the region to feel they need to catch up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incredibly, he wants to increase the number of operational long&hyphen;range F111 bombers. The previous government brought some F111G aircraft in the post&hyphen;Cold War fire sale, but intended to keep them for attrition reserves, not to add them to the operational fleet. This government wants to add them. How many, Minister? At what cost to the fleet? At a stroke this will increase our ability to threaten regional neighbours with military force. Remember how the then Indonesian ambassador reacted when the F111G purchase was first announced. What do you expect them to do now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister wants to expand our air&hyphen;to&hyphen;air refuelling capability in unspecified ways, but this capability will only increase the range at which we threaten other countries. What would the minister have to say if China introduced substantial air&hyphen;to&hyphen;air refuelling into its air force? What would our response be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He wants to expand the capabilities of our FA18 force. This force is already air&hyphen;to&hyphen;air refuelable and can reach deep into South-East Asia. What target would the minister like to reach&mdash;Beijing or Pyongyang? The essence of this statement is expansion of the military power of a country which admits itself to be secure, a country which, by the way, concentrates on budget black holes. It seems that this is a black hole with a black hole. How can Australia justify all this military power when he says it is secure? Of what relative value is this power in the face of the very real non-military threats which Australia faces, threats this government ignores or even helps worsen, such as climate change?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a depressing document. It shows that the conservative parties in Australia are like the old Bourbons of France restored to power after the defeat of Napoleon. It was said of them that they had learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. They have been waiting for this: this statement shows that, since their ill&hyphen;starred intervention in Vietnam all those years ago, Australian conservatism has learnt little and forgotten less.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FOREWORD</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Select Committee's report on its inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Child Support Scheme was tabled in December 1994. The former Government tabled an interim response in March 1995 which addressed 53 of the 163 recommendations (Appendix 1). The recommendations addressed in the interim response were mainly concerned with the Child Support Agency's administration of the Scheme. Following extensive examination, this Government has agreed responses to the remaining Joint Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the Joint Committee's recommendations, the Government considers its responses provide a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10053"> framework in which a more equitable balance can be achieved between the interests of separated and intact families, children of first and subsequent families, and both parents and taxpayers. However, in any changes made to the Child Support Scheme, the Government remains committed to protecting the interests of the children affected by the Scheme and reinforcing the principles of the Scheme, particularly that parents share in the support of their children according to their capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the Government commends the already growing awareness within the community of the ongoing responsibilities of parents after separation. The change in community attitudes in relation to child support is clearly evident in the large and growing number of separated parents who are making adequate private collection arrangements. Wherever possible, the Government encourages parents to make suitable private arrangements for the ongoing support of their children. At the same time, the Scheme provides a means to ensure that responsibility for financial support is shared fairly when parents cannot reach agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention that, as the Child Support Scheme continues to mature, it will be increasingly accepted as part of a much wider system of support which encourages separated parents to accept joint ongoing responsibility for their children's wellbeing in all ways, not just financially.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Government would like to take this opportunity to thank the Joint Committee for the extensive work involved in their examination of numerous policy, administrative and management issues and for the recommended ways in which to improve the Child Support Scheme. The Government believes that the changes made in response to the Joint Committee's report will enhance the fairness and simplicity of the Child Support Scheme, ensuring its continued durability and acceptance both by those directly affected and by the wider community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responses to the Joint Committee's recommendations contained within this report are aimed at fine tuning the Child Support Scheme by making the Scheme easier to access, improving the certainty and speed of payments and facilitating private arrangements where possible. The changes lay the foundation for a greater range of circumstances to be addressed and to enhance a Scheme that is a world leader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the Joint Committee's recommendations, the Government acknowledges that some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changes are necessary to redress the perceived imbalance in the formula and as a result, a number of adjustments have been agreed. While the changes will give some financial relief to payers, the Government has ensured they will not significantly disadvantage children or payees, nor have a detrimental impact on taxpayers. Also, the fundamental principle of the Child Support Scheme, that both parents are responsible for the support of their children, has been reinforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to service delivery and administration, the responses to the Joint Committee's report propose ways to simplify legislation and streamline registration, information provision and payment services between the Department of Social Security, Centrelink and the Child Support Agency. These changes are expected to lead to significant improvements in service to parents and a reduction in Government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to ongoing monitoring and refinement of the Child Support Scheme and fully supports the Joint Committee's view that the Scheme should be regularly evaluated. As part of this process, the views of interested parties will continue to be actively sought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, while the Joint Committee did not make any recommendations to vary the child support formula percentages, they did recommend that an independent study into the cost of children be undertaken to enable the percentages to be critically evaluated. This research is underway and will be completed by the end of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a whole, the response to the Joint Committee signifies the Government's ongoing commitment to refining the complex balance between the interests of the taxpayer on the one hand and equity between separated parents on the other, while ultimately protecting the interests of the children.</PARA>

A consent order is usually obtained by filing an application together with the terms of a draft consent order. The Family Court has delegated to its registrars the power to make orders by consent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and had, prior to the report being tabled, set up a number of mechanisms to develop and implement consistent policies and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency recognises that it must be consistent and fair in its dealings with all clients if it is to administer the Scheme in an effective and equitable manner. The Agency's Policy Development Unit was established in January 1993 to tackle this issue. This Unit promotes consistency in understanding and application of national policies and procedures by issuing discussion papers, policy guidelines, Child Support Determinations and Child Support Rulings. Matters requiring policy development are identified and prioritised by conducting regular surveys of Agency staff and external stakeholders. The process for developing policy documents is a consultative one involving the same internal and external stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is monitoring the implementation of national policies and procedures to ensure they are applied consistently. To support this process, the Agency has established regional structures to identify inconsistencies in practices. A Deputy Registrar in each region has responsibility for child support matters in his or her region. A regional executive forum consisting of the regional Deputy Registrar, branch office directors and a staff association representative meets regularly. One of their responsibilities is to ensure that policies and procedures are applied consistently in the region and to take remedial action where this is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency also holds national conferences involving all branch office directors. One role of these conferences is to contribute to consistency of practice and procedure.</PARA>

The Agency does not intend to introduce dedicated case officers with assigned responsibility and accountability for the bulk of its individual clients as this would not be an efficient use of its limited resources. Members of the Registrar's Advisory Panel and regional advisory groups recognised this and supported the Agency's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Blueprint process, the Agency considered a number of models for case management and came to the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Case ownership will provide clients with better service and will improve compliance only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10086"> if targeted correctly and supported by an appropriate infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This arrangement should be team based with provision for client ownership to rest with individual staff within each team for specific and current issue management.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The introduction of individual case ownership should be seen as an enhancement rather than a solution. It should be a longer term goal for consideration after more systemic issues have been addressed and a period of consolidation has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed approach will provide responsive and robust client service where all members of the team are available to attend to their clients' needs as they arise. The service will not be dependant on the availability of an individual case officer. The team will have a richer pool of knowledge and experience with greater capacity to deal with a range of issues than one individual may have, and the capacity for individual case management is available as problems or issues arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the needs of individual clients can be diverse, each multi&hyphen;function team will be able to provide most of the services their clients require from within the team. The remainder will be undertaken within a specialist team whose functions need to be performed separately for reasons of specialisation and accountability. The Agency has recognised the need to address issues of quality service and clear lines of responsibility and accountability. These issues have been given high priority throughout the Blueprint process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A team based approach also offers the Agency the flexibility to adjust staffing arrangements as the need arises without significantly disrupting client/staff relationships, as would be the case with individual client ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The team based approach to case management will be developed further and implemented consistently in all branches during 1995 through a process of work and job design.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports these two recommendations and has already taken some action to address them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency acknowledges that some of the problems relating to interpretation and implementation of court orders arise due to a lack of understanding by Agency staff as to the effect of particular clauses in court orders. However, problems also arise from ambiguous or ineffective orders being made by the courts and sought by legal practitioners. The Agency is currently working with the legal profession to improve the quality of court orders by developing model orders and disseminating these with supporting information through professional associations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency issued a discussion paper in October 1994 dealing with interpretation of court orders. The paper refers to the difficulties encountered by staff in the interpretation of court orders which contain terms and expressions capable of subjective interpretation and provides a guide to interpretation of some of the most frequent areas of difficulty. The aims of the discussion paper are to improve consistency of interpretation across branches and to assist in the correct registration of court orders and court registered agreements. In response to comments received on the discussion paper, the Agency will develop a ruling aimed at achieving consistency of interpretation of those types of clauses.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency already complies with these requirements. The recommendation appears to be based on the Committee's misunderstanding of the Agency's current practices. The Agency's current administrative practice is consistent with the statutory requirements of the Acts which allow the Agency to collect an assessed liability whether or not an application has been made under section 107.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned that a person who is notified of the Registrar's decision to accept an application for administrative assessment is not given the correct amount of time to appeal against that decision. The Committee's concern stems from the fact that the Agency issues a letter to prospective liable parents before making a decision on an assessment application (referred to as a "pre&hyphen;acceptance letter"). The purpose of this letter is to inform the person named as liable parent that the application has been received and to explain what action the Agency will be taking to process it. The letter also contains a schedule indicating the amount of child support which may be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This pre&hyphen;acceptance letter is issued as part of the general process of administering the Scheme and not because there is a legislative requirement to do so. The letter is sent as a client service and its use has been supported by the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once an application is formally accepted, the Registrar issues a notice under section 34 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 </EMPHASIS> advising the liable parent of that decision. The liable parent can apply for a declaration under section 107 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 </EMPHASIS> that the application should not have been accepted. The time limit for applying for such a declaration starts to run from service of the notice under section 34. It does not run from the time the pre&hyphen;acceptance letter is sent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee stated that, because the notice under section 34 is not issued until, on average, 19 days after the pre&hyphen;acceptance letter, the liable

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear John,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing, on behalf of the Government, to provide you with a response to your Committee's 25th Report which was tabled in the Senate on 1 September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes your Committee's report on its inquiry into the superannuation arrangements for parliamentarians and judges. I note that Committee members were all of the view that the Remuneration Tribunal should be involved in setting parliamentary superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be giving further consideration to the findings of the Committee on parliamentary superannuation. Changes to the method of setting parliamentarians' remuneration are contemplated by the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997, namely setting parliamentarians' remuneration by reference to classifications set by the Remuneration Tribunal rather than by direct linkage to public service SES salaries as at present. The Committee's recommendations on parliamentary superannuation will be considered in the context of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the judges' pensions scheme, the Government agrees that the scheme should be retained. The Government is consulting with the federal judiciary before finalising its view on the proposed modifications to the scheme. However, the Government is not, at this stage, disposed to support the lowering of the age at which a judicial pension would be available, believing that such a move could encourage early retirement from the Bench.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this list to the Senate follows the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10116"> to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills, though such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown making a statement relating to the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S136">Sun Fund Bill 1997</XREF>  was presented to the Senate by me some months ago. It then went to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for review, and today we have the report back from that committee. I am sorry that the government has attempted to prevent me from making some comment on this report, because it is an important matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sun Fund is a very bright idea. It is a move to extend through a capital grant to farmers and miners the opportunity of installing renewable energy on their properties&mdash;solar energy or wind power. I am pleased to say that, while there has been some demur by the committee on the idea of the funding coming from the diesel fuel levy rebate scheme, the idea of the solar power availability to rural areas has been endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular I want to endorse the committee's recommendation that the government investigate the implementation of a scheme to encourage the increased use of renewable energy systems in regional and remote areas of Australia. The committee considered that the scheme had a number of potential benefits for farmers and other people in regional areas. These include the beneficiaries having the ability to use diesel and renewables&mdash;solar power or wind power&mdash;at the same time and getting up&hyphen;front financial assistance from the government to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, through the boost to solar power and to wind power, it will also be a boost to jobs in regional Australia. It is one small answer to unemployment in the bush. Beyond that, if government gets behind this idea, it is a potential great boost both to the manufacturing and to the research and development of renewable energy forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia leads the field so far as photovoltaics are concerned&mdash;that is, solar panels. But it is a lead that we are rapidly going to lose unless we get government action as countries that are nowhere near as well endowed with solar power as Australia is&mdash;countries like Switzerland and Japan&mdash;put huge amounts of government investment into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this field. They know that next century is the solar century; they know that this is going to be a huge export business as well as a domestic boom; and they know that there are jobs aplenty to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme that I have proposed in this  Sun Fund Bill 1997  would create about 1,000 jobs in the bush and would also pour millions of dollars into the alternative energy businesses. Yesterday I spoke at the Australian and New Zealand solar energy conference in this city. I was enormously impressed by the displays from business, often small business, and by the innovative minds at that conference. The willingness, the nous, and the ideas are there in the Australian community. All that is lacking is government action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, the committee is saying to the government, `For goodness sake, get behind solar power in this country because of the domestic benefits as well as the benefits that will flow on to the rest of the world.' Here on the eve of the Kyoto conference, which is trying to curb the awesomely destructive impact of global warming, is an idea which of itself would create half the benefit that the government's total greenhouse package which was announced a couple of weeks ago sets out to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the committee has given encouragement to this idea. I hope the government takes up the challenge issued in this committee report to put a boost into the investment in renewable energy systems, particularly in rural Australia where it has the double boon of replacing fossil fuel in the form of diesel electricity generation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to table the report on this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will remember that it was former Senator Sid Spindler who introduced the Sexuality Discrimination Bill 1995 into the Senate. The objective of the bill was to ensure that the rights which were available to other Australians were available to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in 1996 and the Committee held hearings in all Capital cities and in Canberra between August and October 1996. The Committee was impressed with the quality of the submissions received and the evidence given, and wishes to thank all those people and organisations who contributed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate that there has been some concerns about the time taken to report on the reference, and some belief that there was no interest in completing the report or presenting it in a timely fashion. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was not the case&mdash;the program of work dealt with by both the Legislation and References Committees has been intensive, both last year and this year. In particular, the inquiry into Euthanasia in January/February this year used substantial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, on behalf of the Committee, want to place on record our thanks to the Legal and Constitutional Secretariat for their work in arranging witnesses and developing the hearings program; and in drafting the report and in meeting the objective of reporting in this session:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neil Bessell and Catherine Hawkins deserve special mention for their work in developing a high quality hearings program which resulted in the provision of extensive and very thorough evidence;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pauline Moore came late to the Inquiry and did a super-human job in analysing the submissions and evidence for the draft report. It was a magnificent effort and a debt of gratitude is owed to Pauline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numerous staff in the Committee Office, especially Diane Koepke, Jenny Hill, Jade Ricza and Rachel Kelly who helped with typing and setting up the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to acknowledge the contribution by the Deputy Chair of the References Committee, Senator Abetz, during the Committee's inquiry and especially during the hearings program. The issues the Committee was dealing with were ones which aroused considerable emotion and many witnesses expressed their emotions openly. I consider that Committee members demonstrated high quality skills in their effective management of issues and in their commitment to obtaining useful and comprehensive information to illuminate the issues. I thank Senator Abetz in particular for his support and assistance to me and also for his work and his contribution to discussions and questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rights which Senator Spindler was concerned about in developing and introducing this bill, were not special rights. Nonetheless, the Committee heard from some witnesses that homosexual people wanted a range of-special rights and protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was also concern that the proposed vilification sections in the bill would limit free speech; and that religious bodies and organisations would have their principles ignored. Witnesses suggested that vilification provisions were prone to abuse and would give too much power to people to attack those who made any comment about them. Others indicated that the bill would force them to employ people they did not approve of, in contravention of their religious beliefs; or that it would force religious bodies to accept homosexual or transgender members into their churches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became apparent during the inquiry that there are many assumptions made about homosexual and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10125"> transgender people and these assumptions demonstrate how much we try to demonise or mock those who are different. Homosexual people are talked about as if they were concerned only with sex, and not as if they are people with many other roles in life. If they get beaten up, it is argued, they ask for it. It is suggested that transgender people are really only interested in being drag queens or seeking instant fame as sports stars where they have an unfair advantage over `real' women. Why, then, it is asked, should such people have any benefits or any support from society?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people suggested that gays and lesbians in fact were not discriminated against, had too much influence already and sought to obtain more. In some cases, while it was agreed that there should not be any verbal or physical assault of people because of their sexuality, it was thought that existing legislation was adequate to deal with any violence or discrimination that did occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not believe that this is the case. Society has legislation in place which prohibits assault and incitement to hatred, but this does not appear to be sufficient, in part because there is a culture which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is acceptable to attack some people either physically or in more subtle ways.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> definitions of spouse or partner generally exclude same sex couples and transgender couples, often depriving them of the right to provide for partners, a right assumed by heterosexual couples whether legally married or de facto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the form of protection the law offers to homosexual and transgender people. Many witnesses agreed that this was the situation that such people experienced, but they did not think that it required much in the way of legal change. Attitudes change gradually, and, it seems, those who choose to be outside the mainstream can wait until the mainstream is ready to tolerate them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not agree with this approach. It is not concerned with the issues of whether people choose to be homosexual or transgender, or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether people's sexuality or gender identity is determined by factors over which they have little control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee worked from the premise that there were homosexual people, and transgender people, and that they had rights which weren't acknowledged and responsibilities that they were sometimes prevented from meeting. In such a situation, legislation is often the best way of overcoming discrimination which is so institutionalised that many people are unaware of it and of the limits which it places on the participation of people in everyday life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that legislation is a means of educating people, and that this education occurs in at least two ways: the existence of the law makes people aware of issues and of the effects these have on others. At the same time legislation helps the disadvantaged to take action, and discourages all forms of abuse by imposing penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian society was sufficiently concerned about the status of women, people with disabilities and people of a range of ethnic backgrounds to implement anti-discrimination laws prohibiting different forms of discrimination. The fact that this legislation is still in force does not mean that it is ineffective&mdash;in fact, as was stated by anti-discrimination</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">organisations themselves to the Committee, one of the most important if often unrecognised roles of anti-discrimination legislation is that it can help solve problems before irreconcilable differences occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another argument against Commonwealth legislation was that it would only duplicate existing State and Territory legislation. The Committee was mindful of the need to avoid duplication, especially given the argument that the relevant international covenants did not explicitly talk about sexuality and gender identity. Nonetheless, while there is much that is of benefit in State and Territory anti-discrimination legislation, the fact remains that Sin some states legislation is limited in effect. Further, it cannot address issues which are under Commonwealth control; and, while a number of day to day concerns are matters for States to resolve, it is important for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that it is opposed to systemic discrimination.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sexuality Discrimination Bill 1995 was an initiative of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he introduced the bill into the Senate just over two years ago, our then Senator for Victoria, Sid Spindler, set out the reasons for the development of the bill. These included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that people receive equal treatment in areas governed by Commonwealth law and are protected against discrimination on the grounds of their sexuality or their transgender identity,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that no special rights are developed for people of transgender status or non-heterosexuals but that they have rights equal to those available to others;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that there be protection for people who are going through a gender re-assignment process `or identifying as transsexuals'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Spindler emphasised fiat the bill did seek to give to the non&hyphen;heterosexual community rights more extensive than those available to others. It sought only to ensure that people had equal access to rights, and that they were not discriminated against in a number of areas&mdash;areas which included superannuation and insurance, employment, education, industrial relations and the provision of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has had a rather tortuous passage to this point, but the Democrats have always been willing to have the bill subject to public scrutiny and debate because we believe it to be a fair, just and sensible piece of legislation. We believe that&mdash;when the hysteria and prejudice which often accompanies these issues is separated from the detail of the bill&mdash;we have put forward a proposal which gives effect to a very simple and fair proposition: that Australians should not be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee confirms that view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reflects evidence presented to the Committee indicating that many of the rights and freedoms that are considered an integral part of Australian society are not readily available to non-heterosexuals or to transgender persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has canvassed the issues and a range of views and the Democrats accept the Committee's recommendations. The majority of the Committee is to be congratulated for having approached the bill with an open mind, with a willingness to explore the issues and with a commitment to giving equal protection from harassment and discrimination to all Australians, irrespective of their sexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me repeat: neither the bill nor this Committee report is about giving preferred status to non-heterosexuals.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10127">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not about giving anyone any special or new rights. It is about giving everyone the same rights. It is a simple recognition that many people are not heterosexual. Now that may be a reality which some don't like&mdash;but their dislike or discomfort or fear is not going to change that reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recognised that reality. Wisely, it has not sought to assess whether sexuality is a given factor or a matter of choice&mdash;it has simply considered the best ways of addressing an existing reality regardless of the causal factors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats hold the very strong that what consenting adults do in private is their own business&mdash;and that business should not form the basis of discrimination. I would have thought that would be a position in line with a true small-l liberal philosophy&mdash;although, of course, it's always interesting to see some of those who like to call themselves `liberal' backing the rights of the individual when it comes to economic matters, but throw those same rights out window when it comes to matters of sexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats can see no reason for discriminating against people living together in committed relationships simply because they are not married or are not heterosexual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly pleased with the Committee's recommendation that the Commonwealth should develop a "consistent and gender neutral definition of living in a genuine domestic partnership" for use by all Commonwealth agencies and departments. I think it is well past the time that we formally acknowledged that many heterosexual couples do not want to get married&mdash;for a variety of reasons&mdash;and that many non-heterosexual couples live in long-term relationship which are every bit as committed and close as traditional marriages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians who choose to live their personal lives in these ways are not second-class citizens. They have a fundamental right to make those personal and individual choices and their decisions should be respected and recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this majority report, the Senate legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has formally recognised the need to establish important, basic principles of equality. It has acknowledged that non-heterosexual Australians are discriminated against and have lesser legal rights than heterosexual Australians. It has recognised that the Democrats' proposed bill fills a gap in our human rights and discrimination legislation&mdash;and I believe its&mdash;recommendations improve and clarify our original bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Democrats, I thank the committee for its consideration of the bill. I also thank the Committee secretariat for its work on this reference. I believe the Committee's report represents a mature and sensible approach to these issues. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will take the Committee's recommendations on board and we will re-present the new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sexuality and Gender Status Discrimination </EMPHASIS> in the new year&mdash;when I hope all parliamentarians will approach it in the same spirit of maturity and tolerance as shown by the majority of the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support the motion and to welcome this report. The legislation which was brought forward by former Democrat Senator Sid Spindler was aimed at ending discrimination in this country on the basis of sexuality for transgender people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a major matter. We are talking about one million to two million members of the Australian community. In fact, it affects the whole of the Australian community. How we relate to each other, how we accept diversity and difference and how well we celebrate diversity and difference affects the wellbeing of the whole of the community. This report and the bill on which it was based are milestones in the move towards our becoming a more enlightened and humane society which recognises and celebrates diversity. Not the least, we are dealing with personal matters of sexuality and sexual identification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is a resounding corroboration of the need for legislation nationally to ensure that citizens in this country who are not heterosexual but who identify as homosexual or bisexual or transgender are awarded no less protection under the law from discrimination than are people on any other account. There is a major gap in the law nationally and at many subnational jurisdiction levels, which needs to be addressed. This committee's report is good reading, substantial reading, for people who are concerned that discrimination is a long way from being ended in this country. I might say that there is no way of moving to end that discrimination on the base of sexuality, other than for there to be backup at legal level, at legislative level, to ensure things are put right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee found, in its deliberations, a lot of discrimination. There are a lot of people&mdash;not just thousands, but hundreds of thousands of people&mdash;in this country who live lesser lives, not because of their own nature or of their own actions but because of subtle, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10128"> direct or hurtful discrimination practised against them in a wide variety of ways on the basis of their sexuality&mdash;because they do not identify as heterosexual. We are a lesser society because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the strongest possible fashion, this report calls for national action to end this untenable situation and to put it to rights. One way in which this parliament can put it to rights is by following the lead set by the Democrats and former Senator Spindler in enacting national legislation to ensure that discrimination on the basis of sexuality is made illegal, however it might be practised and in whatever form&mdash;insidious or overt&mdash;it might be used against citizens in this country. Those citizens are contributors to society in every way and should be accorded the right of freedom from discrimination and the tactics of those who believe that they, in some way or other, have a right to discriminate against people on the basis of sexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point to one particular matter which shows that it is not just the occasional epithet flung at a homosexual or transgender person from a car window, or at a couple or a group, or abuse in a park or at a theatre, or in other unexpected circumstances, which has to be countermanded. With superannuation there is institutionalised discrimination which cannot be allowed to continue and which demands urgent action. It is no less than the confiscation of the funds of those people in the community outside the bounds of heterosexual marriage or de facto status. People who do not fit within those bounds are accorded totally different status as far as taxation and superannuation are concerned and so are unable to pass on to their partners, or to the person they designate, the benefits of the superannuation funds which they have accumulated through a life of contribution to our society. This is wrong. It is an outrage and it requires government action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just this report that has called this iniquitous situation to the attention of this parliament. As far back as 1995, the relevant committee looking at superannuation recommended to the Senate that legislative action be undertaken to ensure that all citizens were treated equally as far as superannuation is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned. That includes single people, so that they could designate to whom they wanted their superannuation benefits to flow in the event of their death. Why should that not be? Why should they be treated differently from the people next door who happen to be in a de facto relationship or are married? There is no logical or fair reason for this circumstance, but every day of the week hundreds of thousands of people in this country pay their superannuation benefits knowing that they are going to be defrauded of their rights further down the line, knowing that they are not equal under the law and knowing that this parliament has failed to act on its own advice in the past to put to right this very wrong situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the time has come when there are enough people in the Senate with a sense of justice and a fair go to put this situation to right. Sure, money is involved. Sure, those who are advantaged at the expense of the disadvantaged may want to keep that wrongful advantage, but we have now had two major inquiries canvassing opinions right throughout this nation which have said that we should put a stop to this unfair situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the appeal, on the back of this report, that the government take action to bring justice into the superannuation situation in this country. If it is all right to legislate to make superannuation mandatory, then surely it follows that there is a responsibility to make superannuation payments and benefits fair for all citizens. It is time that this jurisdiction caught up with enlightened countries elsewhere in the world in this important respect. There are many other components to this report which make it valuable reading for all citizens, not just for those who are particularly interested in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to talk about the many thousands of transgendered people in our community who are very much overlooked. The committee had quite a tussle with trying to defined transgendered people and, I think, made somewhat of a mistake in trying to define them because to define means to confine. But the matter is at least addressed in this report where transgendered people are recognised as the valuable people in our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10129"> society that they are. Quite clearly, the call through the report is for a fair go and an end to discrimination against this particular component of our society and citizenry through government action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The call for government action is there. All that is required now is the commonsense, the goodwill and the sense of responsibility from the Howard government to see that, in the coming 12 months, a response is made to the wider community call in this report to put an end to the discrimination of the past. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are about to embark upon a number of issues which amount, together and individually, to a really pernicious, gratuitous act of dispossession and extinguishment of title that is in no way justified by the Wik decision. The measures involve a racially discriminatory acquisition of property, with insufficient notification, no just terms and no beneficial measure to try to in some way make the measures constitutional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, we talk about reserved land. We talk about the way the government is proposing its measures with respect to facilities for services to the public. We will come to the freehold test later. Renewals and extensions is another of those areas. All these areas together show what we have been saying about the government. When the government says there is no blanket extinguishment, we say in response that they are actually putting together this elaborate little quilt of extinguishment&mdash;section by section, it all comes together. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen some measures passed by the committee this morning with respect to process. Here we are tackling a number of government measures to take away people's rights with respect to different categories of land. In many ways, this is not one of the high profile debates about validation, extinguishment or right to negotiate, but I do not think anyone with a social conscience can accept what the government is trying to do in this particular area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10135">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, it involves reserve land and three or four other areas that, together, try to do things which are in no way justified by the Wik decision and in no way can be justified because they dispossess people of property rights, with no just terms, no notification and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look, for instance, at the first part of the government's proposal with respect to reserve land. The government wants to extend reservations prior to 23 December 1996 rather than 1 January 1994. In essence, it is trying to say, `Well, for all those reservations in that period, don't worry about the operation of the Native Title Act. Just make believe it wasn't there for the last couple of years and don't worry about the need to have processes in place to ensure justice in the process.' The government says it wants to extend its amendments with respect to reservations for this period. There is absolutely no reason and no justification for this measure in Wik. It is a measure which I find totally offensive in that it is discriminatory. It takes away property rights that people could have been pursuing for that intermediate period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments also seek to allow different acts to be carried out&mdash;that is, not just the acts for which the land was reserved but different acts, so long as the impact of such acts is no greater than the reservation. In terms of certainty in law, what sort of certainty does that provide anyone? It is vague and it is not in accordance with the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the examples the bill gives is that, if land was reserved for a hospital any time before 23 December 1996, it can be used as a school in the future. Does that presume that the school is not going to be bigger than the hospital? Does it presume any other aspects of impact on surrounding areas, on native title claimants or potential claimants who live around that particular part? It is a vague test, but it is one that, in its vagueness, is intended to have an ambit operation. Another example in the bill is: if there is a reservation for a national park, this would allow the creation of a national park management plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say, with respect to all these: why shouldn't indigenous Australians who may have an interest in the area be part of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process? Why shouldn't they have, in some instances, a full right and, in some other instances, a capacity to really put forward and to have taken into account in a meaningful way their concerns and their rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason for allowing these things. For instance, there is nothing which limits the land from being used as a government facility. The concern also is that it does not just stop there. In the event of the land being provided for the benefit of a third party, then this provision allows a change of the interest and a change of those who could pursue that interest. If the land were to be provided for the benefit of the third party, this could take place without the rights that ordinary Australians would be entitled to. It would happen without compulsory acquisition and it would happen at the expense of a native title holder's possible right to negotiate. This is clearly discriminatory and anyone with a social conscience would come to two conclusions: it is not justified in its discrimination, and it cannot be justified as emanating from the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also always substantial argument that reservations and proclamations themselves did not extinguish or affect native title. So native title rights should be able to be continued in full. But they will not in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision has a third problem. It also allows acts to be carried out under grants of leases to statutory authorities prior to, once again, 23 December 1996 if the state authority or any person uses it for the purpose of the earlier grant. So you can basically transfer the right to a statutory authority or any other person. If all this does not amount to a land grab without a legitimate factoring in of native title interests, a land grab for which Australian taxpayers will have to pay, a land grab which is in no way justified by Wik and a land grab for which the government has not put up any sustainable case at all to maintain that this should happen, and if the public knew that what they will be asked to do is pay compensation because the Commonwealth has decided that some person may inherit a right or that right may be extended and that Aboriginal Australians were excluded from a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10136"> fair process, I reckon that they would bucket it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision also states that where the new act is a public work, this extinguishes native title permanently. There are real problems with that. The permanency aspect is a real problem. It takes away future property rights, and it is in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. The government has gone around the country saying, `We're not extinguishing native title. There is no blanket extinguishment.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, was right, and this is one of those bucket loads of extinguishment which, in all sense of morality, constitutionality and justice to all involved, including indigenous Australians and taxpayers, you cannot justify. The committee cannot justify passing it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Subdivision J, which is what we are talking about at the moment, is intended to implement part of point seven of the government's 10-point plan. As Senator Bolkus has indicated, it intends to present another one of these buckets. Future actions for the management of any existing national park or forest reserve would be allowed. This is misleading, as governments already have sufficient power under the current Native Title Act to manage these areas should negotiations with native titleholders not result in agreement. The subdivision would prematurely stifle any meaningful negotiations about indigenous concerns and the possibilities of joint management of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As drafted, subdivision J goes well beyond national parks and forest reserves to apply to any land reserved for a particular purpose before 23 December 1996. As Senator Bolkus says, it is a massive land grab. Where an act is done in accordance with an existing reservation&mdash;that is in proposed subparagraph 24JA(1)(e)(i)&mdash;and the reservation predates 1 January 1994, the act will be valid. There is no justification for extending this regime to acts not done in accordance with the reservation, especially as the likely effect is extinguishment. If the reservation was done in the intermediate period, there is no reason to validate it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments have full power to compulsorily acquire native title and ordinary title if land is needed for public purposes in the future. This subdivision permits gratuitous extinguishment. Leases to statutory authorities are in no different position from those noted. Such a lease has a similar effect with respect to native title as a reservation. This is the same absence of justification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to read from an opinion that has been provided from the Australian Conservation Foundation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo [No. 2]</EMPHASIS>  that, before the RDA, the reservation of land alone is not an act which is capable of extinguishing native title. Rather, the subsequent use of reserved land may extinguish native title if the use is inconsistent with the continued existence of native title. It is possible that the reservation of land may have been inconsistent with native title to some extent. Where land is reserved for a public purpose, the reservation may create a public right to use the land . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was from Randwick Corporation v Rutledge. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, not all reservations of land were intended for public use. Also, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik Case</EMPHASIS>  raises the potential re&hyphen;emergence of native title rights after the removal of a reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of reserves has rarely been scrutinised, there being little opportunity for public challenge for reasons of standing and public administration. However, the uses of reserves is circumscribed by the purpose of the reservation and the legislation under which the reservation is made . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from Woollahra MC v Minister for the Environment. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many uses of reserves in the past may be invalid if they do not conform to this standard (eg. leasing parts of national parks).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the RDA, surviving native title rights in reserves were protected. Dealings in reserves where native title survived may have been consequently invalid. The NTA validated any dealings in reserved land that may have been invalid. However, dealings otherwise must conform with the future act test. Consequently, while the use of reserves that were dedicated between 31 October 1975 and 1 January 1994 may continue after that time in accordance with the reserve purpose (NTA s.228(9)), the use of reserves that were dedicated before the commencement of the RDA must observe the future act test. Given the sparsity of native title determinations, this mean that the low impact future act test (NTA s.234) has significant implications for the use of reserves. To achieve any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10137"> management objectives that don't comply with the low impact future act test (eg. the construction of a ranger station in a national park), land managements must negotiate with native title holders. Native title holders are thus given a substantial role in the management of reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It does go on, but I think the issues here are about whether or not existing rights are being taken away. Quite clearly from that opinion&mdash;and I am sure a number of others&mdash;this is exactly what we are going to see. This is one area where there was, I believe, some negotiation and some assistance from the National Indigenous Working Group, and I am pleased to see there was alteration of the original position taken by the Australian Labor Party. This is an important issue. It is not a small issue. It is another way which state governments can use to simply remove existing rights of indigenous Australians. In that sense, it is in no way acceptable to the Greens (WA).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a remarkable burst of moral outrage on a provision which is very similar in policy intent to provisions in the existing Native Title Act, certainly to the policy intent in subsection 228(9) in respect of reservations and what can be done in future on reservations. We are dealing with land that, in effect, has been alienated in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are proposing here I would have thought was innocuous. What we are talking about is the validity of future acts if the following conditions are met: there must be a valid act that took place on or before 23 December 1996 and that can include validated past acts and the earlier act. The reservation must have been done by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, state or territory or consisted of the making, amendment or repeal of legislation. The earlier act must have contained, made or conferred a reservation to use particular land or waters for a particular purpose. The later act must be a bona fide act done under or in accordance with the reservation or in the area covered by the reservation but only if its impact on native title is no greater than would have been the case for an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> act done under or in accordance with the reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a very strict criterion set down for this provision and for the validity of acts done under it. As I say, it is consistent with the policy intent of subsection 228(9). We are surprised by the vehemence with which this is opposed. We are talking about land which has, in effect, had government action take place in relation to land management. The land is not vacant crown land; it has been reserved for a purpose by properly constituted, democratically elected governments exercising their sovereign power in the past to reserve land for future use. We think seeking to prevent this happening will only cause considerable alienation and difficulty in communities right around Australia and be quite inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument coming from the ALP and others for the complete removal of it is to suggest that the power exists if necessary but that can be done only by compulsory acquisition. If you wish to use the reserve for the purpose for which it was set aside then the only way you can do it, if this section is removed, is by compulsory acquisition which extinguishes native title altogether. Ours is a much more flexible approach. The non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies except for the construction of a public work, which is already provided for in the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National parks are a classic example for which national park managers have to make management plans or construct walkways or safety fences for the public and all the other things that are required for managing of parks or reserves of that kind. All you are left with is a compulsory acquisition process if this subdivision is deleted all together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get this quite ridiculous situation arising if this subdivision is deleted altogether. If subsection 228(9) of the current act applies, that is, the act has been validated&mdash;that is the reservation&mdash;then the act can be performed in accordance with the reservation but not if it was always valid. So you get this nonsense distinction between reserves validated by the Native Title Act and those which were always valid. It has been put to me that you will have states and territories arguing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10138"> that the reservation was made after the Racial Discrimination Act came into effect and therefore is prima facie invalid and therefore validated by the Native Title Act and therefore, under the Native Title Act, can be exercised. Whereas, if that was not the case and it was a valid reservation, you cannot do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a complete nonsense and we do not think it is acceptable. We are talking about land reserved essentially for national parks, hospitals, schools, et cetera&mdash;always reserved by sovereign governments exercising their sovereign powers where they had made that alienation. They wish to give effect to the purpose for which the land was reserved or to a similar purpose where there is no greater impact on native title. We believe that should be allowed under the very strict regime which applies in subdivision J. The non-extinguishment principle applies, as I say, except in relation to public works. There is full right to compensation, et cetera. We propose an amendment to our provision. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if a state government exercises its sovereignty to reserve land for a hospital, why should the Commonwealth parliament say to the state government, `That's all very well, but you can't use it for a school.' In terms of the provision of facilities of that kind, it just seems something of a nonsense to say to a democratically elected government, which has taken the decision, the sovereign act, to reserve the land accordingly in the past, that they cannot use it for an equivalent purpose against the test that there must be no greater impact on native title.

But you could not put a school in where it had been reserved for a national park.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of things that come out of that debate. It is okay for Senator Minchin to focus on governments, but what about individuals? We are concerned about the individual property rights of native title claimants. They are not factored into the equation at all. That is our concern here. If a reservation was made some time ago, we believe that the reservation that was made is the one that should continue to operate. If there is any change to that, any change to the parties to it, it needs to go back to the drawing board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of things that the government should appreciate about this. Senator Minchin says that this is not much different from what happened in the 1993 legislation. It is substantially different from what happened in the 1993 legislation in that that legislation accepted that there was a trade-off. That trade-off was that indigenous Australians made concessions. Maybe the minister is just discovering the fact that indigenous Australians made concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concessions they made was with respect to reservations, reserve lands. They made that concession, but they got something back in return. The overall package at the time, including the indigenous land fund and so on, was beneficial. Unless you have an overall beneficial package here, you are going to have real problems constitutionally. This is one of the reasons why, for instance, the RDA provisions should apply to this range of activities as well as to others.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are acting in a way which takes away property rights of the Aboriginal race without compensation, without real notification. You are doing it in a number of ways. It may have been approved as a school some 25 years ago, but they might want to do something totally different with it now. For instance, if the property was yours, Senator Minchin, and the government wanted to do something with it, it would not just be a matter of the federal government and the state government getting together and saying, `If you want to do something else with it, go ahead.' They would consult you and they would have to go through the Lands Acquisition Act processes. You have rights here. Fortunately for you, you are not a black Australian. Fortunately for you, you are not going to be subjected to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are important discrimination aspects to this. For instance, you raised earlier the difference between a reservation that was made before the RDA and one made after the RDA. One thing is different&mdash;that is, the RDA came into effect in 1975. If a government has not effected the purpose for which that reservation was made in 22 years, it is a bit rich to be saying 22 years later, `We might decide to do something with it now. We might decide to sell it to Joe Bloggs who wants to build a theatre there, or whatever he wants to build there.' It is all third party, so long as the impact is not different. These criteria are not sufficient to satisfy the tests of just compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting in this part of the debate what Justice Brennan said in Mabo. He said that the crown act of making a reserve will not significantly impact upon native title until the reserve is put to its intended purpose. Therefore, when there has been a reservation and, say, 20 years later the reservation has been put to its intended purpose, it may be property characterised as being akin to vacant crown land for native title purposes. So, in these circumstances, any adverse treatment of native title in such an area by the bill will have a significant impact on the native title claimants concerned. As I said, you might be concerned about government to government but, under the constitution, individuals have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10141"> property rights and rights for just terms compensation.</PARA></SPEECH>

Where it has been validated by the Native Title Act, the reserve can be implemented but, where it is valid, it cannot. It is a legal nonsense. Working through whether the land is validated or a valid reserve, and whether in fact you can act under the Native Title Act or not, seems to us an absolute nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>

They would also have to do so pursuant to land acquisition processes. Indigenous Australians would have a role in that as well.

We can debate it every time this question comes up but we believe the bill as a whole is of benefit to Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much of the discussion and argument we have had in respect of the previous item is relevant to this item on facilities for services to the public as well. The government amendments provide for validation of future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10144"> acts that provide services to the general public, such as transport facilities, electricity supply and so on. These future acts the government intends to validate unless they prevent native title holders from gaining physical access to affected areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The form of validation proposed by the government will mean that such future acts do not need to pass through the non-discrimination threshold test. Basically, the bill will enable a raft of future acts to evade the non-discrimination freehold test and to do so without, for instance, having to pay heed to even matters as important as heritage protection. As a result, the government's provisions will, once again, acquire property rights of native title holders in a racially discriminatory manner and in a way which fails to provide heritage protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some pretty fundamental concerns with this item. We are totally frustrated that we cannot seem to get this message through to a majority of the chamber. We are talking here of a racially discriminatory appropriation of property. At the end of the day, there may be a provision in the legislation to provide just terms in terms of value, but there is absolutely no attempt by the government to meet the test required in respect of meeting the just terms provision in the constitution. As expressed by Justice Deane in the Tasmanian dams case, the compensation needs to be something in relation to which the property holder has to have some awareness of the process and the compensation must be somewhat more contemporaneous than is provided in these circumstances by this legislation. Compensation paid five or 10 years after the event is not just terms compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a raft of amendments again. They are designed to restrict the scope of the subdivision so that it only applies to existing facilities. We need to pursue amendments to improve heritage protection measures and also to implement and clarify adequate procedural rights. What we are about is minimising the impact on native title rights already impaired while ensuring protection of heritage, natural justice and just terms compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about the government's proposal, and we are concerned that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notification provisions and the right to negotiate are not adequately protected here. Under our proposal any extinguishment will not be permanent, as opposed to the government's proposal which does provide for permanent extinguishment.

It is about ensuring that services to the general public can be provided, particularly in remote communities and in remote Aboriginal communities. We are putting very significant constraints on the way in which this can be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect on native title must be minimal. There must be legislation in existence in the relevant jurisdiction providing for the protection of significant indigenous sites from the effects of the activities. The non-extinguishment principle applies. Compensation is payable by the relevant government and native title holders shall have the same procedural rights as other comparable interest holders in relation to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about, effectively, the provision of basic public services where they pass the test of having minimal impact on native title. The conditions are set out in 24KA. It must be an act that permits or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10145"> requires the construction, operation, use, maintenance or repair of the listed facilities. They are things like roads, jetties, navigation markers, electricity transmission, lighting, gas transmission and things like that. The activities, construction, operation, use, maintenance or repair of a list of facilities are to be for the general public. The act must not prevent native title holders in relation to the land or waters where the listed facility is, or is to be situated, from having reasonable access to such land or waters in the vicinity of this facility. There must be a Commonwealth, state or territory law that makes provision for the preservation and protection of areas or sites of particular significance to Aboriginal people. As I say, the non-extinguishment principle applies. Native title holders must have the same procedural rights as other title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really do think that some of the exaggerated condemnation of these provisions is unwarranted.

If it is vacant crown land or something like that they will have freehold title rights, but where they have a native title which, under Wik can be a coexisting title that is subject to the rights of the pastoralist et cetera, where you have got people who are sharing that land and therefore have coexisting rights, we believe as a matter of fundamental equity that equivalent procedural rights are the only way to go.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, it is a function of the fact that native title on a pastoral lease is a coexisting title&mdash;you are sharing the land with another title holder. A title has been granted over the land&mdash;a lease&mdash;which may not necessarily extinguish the native title. That would ultimately be a matter for the court to determine, but in the meantime or until a determination is made the pastoralist is an occupier of the land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title holder&mdash;presuming they have had a determination&mdash;has rights on the land as well but in a coexisting manner. So that piece of land is being shared and therefore you have two title holders. All we are saying is that for the purposes of the procedural rights that attach to them they should be treated equally. So when the government wants to put in that service it treats those people equally. If it is on vacant crown land, because there is no other coexisting title and, if there has not been a determination, the native title can potentially amount to an exclusive possession title, which it cannot by definition amount to on a pastoral lease, then, adopting as we have essentially the same freehold test that is in the current Native Title Act, the equivalent way to treat the native title in those circumstances is to equate it to freehold and to guarantee that those title holders who by definition can potentially have a much greater bundle of native title rights should be treated as though they held freehold 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10152"> and have the rights of a freeholder. But on a pastoral lease, by definition they cannot have the same bundle of native title rights, because, to the extent they survive the grant of the lease, they are subject to the rights of the pastoralist.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to move amendment 359. This is a new area that has been proposed by the opposition. As I have tried to say consistently through this debate, we have not taken the approach in this process of just resisting what the government is putting up; we have put up an alternative package. Part of that package is the recognition that to have the bill constitutionally sustainable there needs to be some aspects that balance the negative aspects of the government's legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those aspects, and one aspect which is pretty important for indigenous Australians, is this next proposal that goes to fast tracking. These provisions are intended to be of benefit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to indigenous people. They are intended to be of benefit because they streamline the procedure for the recognition of native title on Aboriginal lands or other categories of lands where the character of the tenure is such that it was clearly intended to benefit indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions will also have the effect of recognising the access rights of people who, despite regular physical contact with the land, are not native title holders. They involve, in essence, an addition of a new schedule, schedule 6&mdash;fast track determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go through some of these provisions. It is important. What we are talking about here is land which is generally and very clearly intended to benefit indigenous people&mdash;Aboriginal reserve lands and other categories of land where the character of the tenure is very clearly for the benefit of Aboriginal people. In respect of these lands, there is a current problem that unfortunately the government has not focused on. There is whole basket of problems that it has focused on but it has not focused on this particular one which is of concern to indigenous people&mdash;that is, very few native title claims have been recognised even over these lands where native title claims are so obviously justified. Our proposition is one that streamlines the procedures for the recognition of native title on these Aboriginal lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions would also have the effect of recognising, as I say, the access rights of people who are not native title holders. The proposals in detail are through the imposition of a new schedule: first, a provision that inserts a capacity for a representative body to perform fast track functions on Aboriginal lands. The representative body could, for instance, identify native title holders, identify indigenous people with an interest in the area and proceed to prepare a determination. A registrar has a role, as a registrar should, in this particular process. We provide for the representative body to notify the registrar of details of the representative body's findings. The registrar is then to provide public notification, registration and the handling of disputes and compensation as well as act in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10157"> interests of protecting non-indigenous interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have a process on a particular area of land, which is essentially clearly intended to benefit indigenous people, and the rep body and the registrar have a role in that process. It overcomes the existing procedural regime which has proven to be overly cumbersome, has resulted in inordinate delays and really is quite senseless when you look at the fact that what we are trying to establish here is a permanent legal place for native title claims with respect to Aboriginal reserve lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the relevant rep bodies are pretty well placed to do the work that we envisage them doing. We also envisage that the process would be informal and cost effective and should not be burdened by formal legalism and, more importantly, that the registrar would exercise the most contentious functions of the procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rep bodies have recognition not just in existing legislation but also under the government's proposal. The government is proposing to give them more functions and this particular function sits very comfortably within the roles of the rep bodies. Let us also appreciate when we are talking about rep bodies that we are talking about bodies which, in the vast majority of cases, have an enormous degree of contact with and respect of the people whom are they are representing. We put this proposal up. I think the government, in the spirit of trying to get a workable regime, should pick this proposal up. In any event, we submit it to the Senate and hope the Senate can see the merit of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a Democrats and Greens WA amendment No. 334 which actually includes, I believe, all of the provisions in the Labor Party's amendment, but it is better because it includes national parks and conservation reserves. That is something which has been very strongly emphasised by the National Indigenous Working Group. It is my understanding that the Labor Party has been convinced by the strength of the arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly know that Tracker will be very pleased if he sees that there is support for the improved version. I hope that this can be supported by the majority of the Senate. The fast tracking provisions do need to actually mean something. There have been a number of changes that we have already seen tonight in relation to what is left of reserves. It is important that these fast tracking provisions do actually assist people working out agreements and do not clog up the system unnecessarily.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We as a government obviously have some sympathy for the direction from which the ALP comes in proposing this package of amendments. It is about land occupied by a reserve for Aboriginal people. Obviously it is in everyone's interests, where native title is sought on such land, to have determinations to that effect made as soon as is practically possible. That is why the government proposes to move amendment 45 which is aimed at much the same thing, and we will come to that later. It seeks to ensure that, where Aboriginal people are in occupation of land either by a reserve or by vacant crown land, any past extinguishment should be ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of talk about the constitution. I regret to say that it is the government's view, based on our legal advice, that the fast tracking proposals submitted by the ALP in this provision, as attractive in principle as they might be, do run into significant constitutional problems. I will not try to play politics with this or try to belabour it in a political sense, but the whole point about Brandy was that it was unlikely that the Native Title Tribunal would be able to exercise judicial functions as a consequence of the Brandy decision. In other words, it was not able to make determinations of native title because that is a judicial function, a common law right. A determination that someone holds that common law right and what the right consists of is clearly a judicial function and can only be exercised by a judicial body. That was accepted by the previous government in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments it proposed to take account of the Brandy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, there is no difference in the constitutional hurdle facing any suggestion that, in effect, a rep body, by and large, is entrusted with the responsibility of effectively making determinations of native title. That is the effect of the opposition amendments in terms of fast tracking determinations. If there is no appeal against what the rep body finds within three months, the registrar must enter the findings on the register as an approved determination of native title. It is subject to appeal, but I regret to say that it is the government's legal advice&mdash;and we are not seeking to stymie this in any way&mdash;that there would be significant constitutional hurdles to a proposition that a rep body is making determinations as to common law rights, which is what native title obviously is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do think there are constitutional objections to the proposal which we do not see any way of overcoming. We are attempting to do what we can through our amend ments in proposed new sections 47A and 47B in relation to the disregarding of previous extinguishing acts on land occupied by Aboriginal people. In what we are doing to streamline the whole process by which native title claims are heard and mediated, and also by way of the much enhanced agreements provisions, we would hope that native title determinations in respect of land currently occupied by Aboriginal people can be facilitated by those agreements provisions and, ultimately, a Federal Court rubber stamping, in effect, agreements to that effect. We have no sort of philosophical objection to what is being put here, but we do think it runs into a significant constitutional problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have actually had a chance to assess the government's response to this, and we do find it not only disappointing in terms of principle but also disappointing in terms of the law that has been suggested here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection (1) in proposed section 191A gives a rep body a role to make some findings in respect to a claim and give the details of those findings to the registrar. The registrar's function is an administrative one. He must notify the public under subsection (2). Under subsection (3), if there is no appeal, the registrar must enter findings and include a notification. We then provide for those categories of people who may have an appeal in subsection (4). Subsection (5) makes it very clear that, if there is anything to be adjudicated upon, it goes to the Federal Court&mdash;application may be made to the court for (a), (b), (c), (d) and, on application to the Federal Court, such and such will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are quite conscious of the Brandy problems but, in this particular case, if anything is to be adjudicated upon, it is done by the court. It is not as if the tribunal is going to make the adjudication, the finding, which was the problem that the High Court focused on in Brandy. In this particular case, the registrar plays a purely administration role, and any adjudicative function is performed by the Federal Court, as the constitution would require and as the Brandy case made quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government have some concern about this, let them consider it in this context. The fast track provision that we are providing for here provides a mechanism similar to the ordinary ex parte application before a court. That is, when there are no parties with a contrary interest who wish to contest the application, the court is entitled to consider the matter and make orders accordingly after satisfying itself of all the necessary matters. It is a process like that but, if there is a matter of dispute, that dispute is quite rightly sent to the Federal Court and no adjudication is made as to people's rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the constitutional obsession of the opposition, I am surprised that they believe they can dance around Brandy in this way. As I am advised, Brandy was a very similar set of circumstances where the Human Rights and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Equal Opportunity Commission made a determination&mdash;sure, that was appealable&mdash;but the determination, as a matter of law decided by the High Court, had no standing. They are providing that there is a determination of native title made by an administrative body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of Brandy and the whole point of all these amendments is that determinations of native title can be made only by a court&mdash;either by the Federal Court under this act or by a supreme court if you are bringing a common law action outside the Native Title Act. You cannot have an administrative body making a judicial determination. If you restructure this so that somehow the findings of the rep body are brought before the court for the court to make a determination, you will have what happened in Crescent Head. That is, effectively, the agreement that was reached with the state government was brought before the Federal Court and the Federal Court effectively rubber stamped the agreement, the determination was made and then the native title, effectively, given up. There was no native title, and there cannot  constitutionally be native title until a determination is made by a court. Otherwise, you just run into the whole Brandy problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are just saying that the determination stands. Sure, there is an appeal, but that is just a normal appeal right. The determination has insufficient constitutional standing, unless that determination is made by a court in the light of Brandy.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10162"> through them as quickly as I can. Amendment No. 13 is extremely technical; it just replaces a heading. Amendment No. 14 is to subdivision A of division 3, part 2, which deals generally with the future act regime. The amendment inserts a new section 24AC which will enable regulations to be made that impose notification requirements in relation to acts or classes of acts that are valid under division 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we announced publicly and to the other parties, this is in response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report. While we did not accept&mdash;and our legal advice substantiates our view&mdash;that notification requirements of this kind were necessary to preserve the constitutionality of the just terms provisions in our bill, we are happy to include in the bill appropriate notification arrangements of this kind without conceding the point about whether they are necessarily required. So amendment No. 14 picks that up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 44 is an amendment to proposed section 44H, which deals with the doing of activities pursuant to requirement or permission contained in a valid lease, licence, permit or authority. This amendment seeks to put beyond doubt that native title rights and interests are not extinguished by the requirement, permission or the doing of any activity in giving effect to the requirement or permission contained in the lease. Again we are simply responding to concerns about our bill that we do not think are well founded, but we want to put those matters beyond doubt. These amendments do not fit into any other block of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 47 is simply to oppose schedule 1, item 27, which is an unnecessary provision. Amendment No. 49 is a amendment to proposed section 214 and it lists those instruments that are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A. The amendment to paragraph 214(a) adds determinations made under paragraphs 24GB(9)(c), 24HA(7)(a) and 24JB(6)(a) to the list of disallowable instruments.

We obviously do not have problems with amendments that tackle typographical issues and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that government amendment No. 70 is one that corrects a technical error by including the function of holding inquiries under section 139 into matters which can be informed by the equivalent state or territory bodies under 207B. We have proposed an amendment to 207B. We are suggesting that we replace 207B by way of our amendment  No. 275. We propose that we replace it with a much more beneficial scheme ensuring that state and territory tribunals do afford native title holders the same rights as they have under the Commonwealth scheme. So I am suggesting that we separate government amendment No. 70 from this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am on state and territory tribunals, as we know, the government proposes that states and territories may establish equivalent state native title tribunals. This proposal raises the likelihood of the existence of numerous native title systems throughout Australia, each with differing rights of review and differing rights of appeal. That is of concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already indicated one amendment, amendment No. 275, which will provide instead that the laws of any state or territory must provide rights of appeal and review that are at least consistent with Commonwealth laws; thereby native title holders and native title parties in the state and territory tribunals will not be dealt with less favourably than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10163"> their equivalents under Commonwealth law. And also, you will not have one particular community in one state being handled and treated less beneficially than others may be in other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also having circulated&mdash;at present, I think&mdash;another amendment relating to accessibility to the National Native Title Tribunal. Given that it is not on the table now, at the conclusion of my remarks on this topic I will suggest that we also deal with it later on in the evening. In this amendment, we are proposing that an applicant may be able to choose the national body, if that person so desires, and a respondent may have the same right to choose to go to the national body rather than to a state based body. So, in essence, our amendment will give parties to proceedings the option to go to a national body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reckon that is the best way to ensure fairness for all in terms of protecting people against having a differential scheme depending on which state they may be in. It is also the best approach to ensure that the law and the practices that are developed are consistent across the nation. They will be opposition amendments Nos 253A, 253B, 253C and 553D. As I said, maybe we should handle these later in the debate, because people might want to have some chance to look at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our other amendments concern the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. We find it quite inappropriate that the government is seeking in this particular legislation to delete references in the Native Title Act to the continuing role of the ATSI Social Justice Commissioner and to provide in their legislation for his replacement by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That is a decision that has not been taken by the parliament at this stage. It is one that will be subject to substantive debate when it does come up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the parliament have some concerns about doing away with the specialist ATSI Social Justice Commissioner, and I am sure other parties here would have the same sorts of concerns. Whilst that matter is yet to be resolved by the parliament&mdash;that

In the meantime, let us not pre-empt any such decision with this broad ranging legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other thing we must say at this particular stage is that, as part of our package, we are committed to providing miners with statutory recognition of their existing right to claim tax deductions for reasonable legal mediation and compensation costs that arise out of native title claims. For constitutional reasons, this measure would be proposed in a separate bill to be moved in the House of Representatives. We cannot tack it on to this bill. However, it is important to put that on the record as part of this debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we provide a national benchmark.

It is important that that capacity be available to parties to ensure adequate review. In many states they would have very little capacity to ensure admin review outside of common law rights. We think the Commonwealth law provisions are important enough to ensure that they are replicated in state jurisdictions before any such jurisdiction can make determinations in respect of native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the government believes strongly in the retention of 207B relating to equivalent state and territory bodies. I would point out that the current Native Title Act, passed by this parliament and proposed by the previous government, provides for recognised state or territory bodies to perform functions under the Native Title Act. In my own state of South Australia, that is currently the case. South Australia operates its own native title system under the auspices of the current act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the very strict criteria we have set down in 207B are more than adequate. 207B says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Basically, these equivalent state bodies are acting as agents under the Native Title Act. They are implementing and performing the functions designated by the Native Title Act, according to the criteria of the Native Title Act under the auspices of the Federal Court. At all times, matters being mediated or dealt with by an equivalent state body are under the auspices of the Federal Court, and any appeals or judicial review or anything else can be done to the Federal Court. The determinations of native title are by the Federal Court, and nothing in any of this affects that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is talking about the administrative functions performed by the tribunal being able to be performed by an equivalent state or territory body, according to the strict criteria laid down by the Native Title Act. Given the growth and the scope of native title claims and the fact that they so often involve state law and parties at state level, it seems imminently sensible and clearly consistent with what is already in the Native Title Act to enable the Commonwealth minister to make a determination in relation to equivalent state or territory bodies, governed very tightly and closely by the provisions set down in this part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They in no way affect the right of claimants who bring claims under this act to have the claims determined by the Federal Court at all times. This is not a determinative function that is being handed to the states. It is the administrative function in relation to working under the auspices of the Federal Court in relation to mediation and other non-judicial functions that will now be performed by the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do think these are sensible provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment goes to the question of management of water and airspace. The government does have amendment No. 25. While Senator Minchin is trying to find that I could probably spend a few minutes spelling out the opposition's position in respect of the management of water and airspace and why we will move amendments to this particular provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognition of native title in the Mabo decision gave rise to the potential for the recognition of native title rights and interests in airspace and in waters, including offshore, onshore and subterranean waters and, of course, the resources within them. Such recognition in accordance with the common 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> law could give native title holders authority to deal with these elements of the environment as owners, and rights to access and use them as resources. To date, according to the Australian common law they have been regarded as natural resources belonging to no&hyphen;one, therefore accessible to anyone. The capacity of the Crown to regulate and manage access to water has mostly been unfettered by having to take into account the property rights in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object of regulation and management has been expressed in a number of court cases, including Thorpes v. The Great Pastoral Company of 1955. I think it is probably worth placing on record the view of the court in that particular case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to enable the Crown in a country in which water is a comparatively scare and important commodity to exercise full dominion over the waters and rivers and lakes and to undertake generally the conservation and distribution of water. For the attainment of that object it was not necessary to destroy anybody's rights but it was necessary to give to the Crown or some statutory authority overriding rights to which private rights must, if need arise, give way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In order to achieve the required regulatory and management control, in most states the right to the use, flow and control of water in most watercourses, lakes and so on was vested in the Crown. It was held by the High Court in the same case that such vesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensured in the same way native title rights will not be extinguished by management of water resources by the Crown and may be exercised not inconsistently by that management.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, since Mabo we have in recent years had a new development. There has also been the development in recent years of a move to go national towards regulating and managing inland waters by creating tradeable property rights in water. These had not been contemplated before and the interacting of native title rights and such property rights has not been addressed in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have pending the Yorta Yorta case. That particular case may very well decide the issue of whether native title exists in onshore waters and the resources in such water. That is a case which has been going for some time&mdash;some would say for too long&mdash;but it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10168"> will be a very critical case in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of airspace, at common law the principle is that ownership of land extends from the heavens to the centre of the earth and that property rights in airspace are attached to the property rights in land. However, the extent of these property rights at common law is uncertain. So native title in land which amounts to full beneficial ownership of the land possibly carries rights in the airspace above it. Native title applications have been made for determinations of native title on airspace along with the land underneath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, we had the Native Title Act. It is worth putting into this debate the importance of the Native Title Act in the development of the law. Under the current provisions of the NTA, sections 23(6) and 211 ensure that the Commonwealth, state or territory laws which require licences or permits before activities can be carried on&mdash;for instance, fishing or hunting and permits to do the same&mdash;do not prevent the exercise of native title rights and interests such as fishing, hunting, cultural and spiritual activities, where those activities are carried on for personal, domestic or non&hyphen;commercial communal needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it is worth remembering that they ensure that native title holders' procedural rights are protected to the same extent as the holders of other rights over the same waters. Also, in section 212(1) the act provides that, subject to the act, a law of the Commonwealth or state may confirm:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any existing ownership of natural resources by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, the state or the Territory, as the case may be; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any existing right of the Crown in that capacity to use, control and regulate the flow of water.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As well as that, it confirms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that any existing fishing access rights prevail over any other public or private fishing rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Most states and territories have, since that time, taken the opportunity to confirm these matters through their own legislation, but any such confirmation was expressed so as not to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extinguish or impair any native title rights and interests. This is in section 212(3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, the common law position on the survival of native title rights and interests in water has been retained, of course until we come to the government's legislation. The government's bill will validate future acts consisting of legislative acts or acts being the grant of leases, licences, permits or authorities under valid legislation relating to the management or regulation of the use of surface and subterranean water or resources in water or airspace, where water includes water in all its forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of these provisions is likely to be broad and it is something that really should concern the committee. For instance, surface and subterranean water in all its forms is likely to include water in rivers, creeks, watercourses, lakes, swamps, marshes, aquifers and bores as well as percolating water. Resources in water may include fish, dugong, crocodiles, other commercially exploitable species with any associated intellectual property, together with minerals in the water. Further regulation and management of airspace may include such things as pollution, that is, tradeable pollution credits, navigation and power to control access to particular airspace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The validation of management regimes will confirm government's ability to control the commercial exploitation of natural resources in which a native title holder might have a property interest. This is to be distinguished from the confirmation of indigenous rights to  hunt, to fish, to gather or to carry out cultural or spiritual activity as is provided in the current section 211.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 24HA of the government's proposals also states that a future act being a lease, licence, permit or authority granted under a management or regulatory regime is also valid. There is a comparison between what the government is proposing and what exists in section 212. The government has pretended that this particular scheme is required so as to confirm the meaning of 212. However, the proposed 24HA is far wider than the current law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10169">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may ask the question at the start: if 212 is there, why do you have to confirm it? The answer is: because the government wants to do much more than just confirm 212. Section 212 enables the confirmation of any existing ownership of natural resources by the Crown or any existing right of the Crown to use, control or regulate the flow of water. We believe this is sufficient to protect existing management regimes from native title uncertainty. We say also that section 212, which provides that any changes to water management regimes should be subject to appropriate negotiation with native title holders as property owners and stakeholders in the resource, is an appropriate provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting that 212 is about preserving the status quo as it existed on 1 January 1994 when the Native Title Act came into effect. The new proposal grants validity to future acts. Its focus is on preserving the state and territory governments' ability to adjust that status quo at the expense of indigenous rights. Section 24HA overrides the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern with the government's proposal is that confirmation of ownership rights or access under the current provision does not extinguish or impair any native title rights and interests. The new provision renders any native title affected by the validated legislation or interests ineffective pursuant to the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, our concern is that section 24HA in effect puts native title in inland waters in the same position as native title in far offshore waters. It gives no protection at all. There will be no limit on what can be done by government or any person in onshore areas, even if native title exists. For instance, there will be no right to negotiate with respect to any grant of property rights in waters. This may enable the effective extinguishment of native title by state and territory management and regulation regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further concern is that if grants are inconsistent interests of third parties will have been and will continue to be validated. We are concerned that the total impact of all this will render ineffective any title rights that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indigenous Australians may have in inland water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have said, since Mabo they have been a stakeholder. There is a balance in the legislation. The legislation takes into account native title interests, but the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  removes from indigenous native title holders all authority to deal with these natural resources and confers that authority on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no duty imposed on government to take into account the interests of native title property holders to ensure they are protected. There is no mechanism such as the right to negotiate, which now applies to compulsory acquisition of native title rights in water for the benefit of the third parties. That will not be retained. Section 24HA does not treat native title holders as significant stakeholders in water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, we are concerned about the government's proposal. The existing regime is one that has not caused any problems over recent years and does give some justice. Our amendments go very much to retaining that particular regime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the topic of management of water and airspace, I would like to point out that the position taken by the Greens and the Democrats through our amendments in consultation with the National Indigenous Working Group is different from those of the ALP. They are different because they actually clarify the situation which is currently unclear in relation to the management of water and airspace and native title rights. As has been mentioned, there is more  than one court case being fought, and the Yorta Yorta case has been mentioned. If that case were to be found positively for the Yorta Yorta, then obviously what we are doing here is very practical. It actually prevents the kind of thing that occurred with pastoral leases under the Native Title Act as a result of the Wik case and all the problems that could occur as a result of those changes from taking place under a future act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, however, wants to stymie the situation by squashing that ability&mdash;or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10170"> potential. So there is a range of views expressed here. The government says, `Let's not have this and let's make it clear.' The ALP says, `Let's take out the subdivision and leave it to the courts.' The Greens, Democrats and the National Indigenous Working Group are saying, `Let's clarify it now to avoid the situation of future act provisions that we will have to come back to at some stage. Let's clarify it and say that native title is not extinguished over water and airspace.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that almost any indigenous Australians you speak to can tell you why this is so very important&mdash;culturally, socially and spiritually. Anywhere in Australia where native title exists there are special places for ceremonies&mdash;sacred sites&mdash;in relation to places of water. They could be creeks, waterholes, rivers, seasonal rivers and so on. They are meeting places. They are special. They are an absolutely important part of the storylines of indigenous Australians.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you wipe out of contention the possibility for indigenous Australians to have a part in their management, you are basically wiping out a large part of their cultural life and identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this might be an appropriate time to ask this question for Robert Bropho from the Nyungah community in Western Australia: what kind of studies, Minister, have been done in relation to this act regarding the social, spiritual and even local economic impact of these kinds of changes on indigenous Australia? We have had quotes about the potential impact on mining investment and on pastoral exports, but have studies been done on the impacts on indigenous Australians? If so, can you point me to them and to the kinds of outcomes there were from the studies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government approached this whole business of amending an unworkable Native Title Act by embarking on a series of consultations immediately after we came to office with a mandate to amend it. Those consultations and inquiries took place all around Australia. Leading up to the Wik decision, we introduced amendments which took the form of draft bills and so on. Then of course the Wik 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision meant that we had to go back to square one. But the Wik decision meant that the area over which native title could be claimed had doubled. There was a most extraordinary increase in the area of Australia potentially subject to native title claims as a result of the Wik decision. So what we are dealing with here is a situation, quite unlike that in 1993, where Aboriginal people have the benefit of being able to claim native title on more than double the area of land which was thought to be available in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We engaged again in another exhaustive round of consultations following the Wik decision to seek everybody's views. We put out the 10&hyphen;point plan and sought comment. We put out a draft bill and sought comment. We put out the bill itself. We have had rounds of inquiries&mdash;parliamentary and otherwise. So there has been every opportunity for people around Australia to have their view on this matter and to indicate it to the government. The Australian farming community does not believe this bill goes far enough, nor does the mining community, nor do state governments. Of course, leaders of the Aboriginal community think it goes too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been elected last year as their government, we have struck what we believe to be the appropriate balance in the Native Title Act on behalf of the Australian people. As the Prime Minister has said, we take the fact that it attracts criticism from all sides as being evidence of the fact that we have struck the right balance in this act. Senator Margetts, I am not sure that I can give a fuller answer than that to your question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the answer from the minister it is quite clear that no actual study has been done, although we have got figures and quotes of what the impact will be on jobs and exports. I think there is a big credibility gap in what has been said in relation to those potentials; however, it does seem clear that there has not been any considered or funded study into the impacts on indigenous Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10171"> ians. This is quite extraordinary considering this is a bill about native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the areas that might be considered to be of spiritual significance and that might end up being taken out of the realm of consultation as a result of this action could include: Todd River; Boobara Lagoon; Lake Victoria; Lake Mungo; Crocodile Dreaming in Broome; inland fishing environments such as the Cooper Basin; Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin; Snowy River; Macquarie Marshes; socially significant areas of customary obligation; gathering and meeting places; trading places; areas of access to cultural activities; stock routes and reserves; access areas for ceremonial materials such as ochre; burial sites and sandy banks; recreational and leisure activities, especially those for children; education and camping sites; and economically significant areas for reeds, shells and stones, examples of which include the Mitchell River system, Cooper Creek, the Lake Eyre Basin and Dalhousie Springs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister raised the old favourite about how much of Australia is available for claim, and hopefully by now he has a copy of the maps that my office staff member put together using sources from the National Farmers Federation, Auslig and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994. One of the maps shows the areas available for mining claim, areas exempt from mining leases, areas of lease or open to lease and marine lease or open to lease, and the areas open for native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining leases must show activity for mining. They take precedence over most other property rights. There is often no negotiation required and mining can be very destructive of the environment and is generally incompatible with other uses. In relation to native title, we have 93 per cent of Australia open for mining leases and we have areas&mdash;up to several hundred kilometres in some places&mdash;offshore. I will mention that point later. It is only areas such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Shark Bay Marine Park which are not claimable at this stage. Of course, we know there are oil rigs off Shark Bay. We also know that areas of national park are not safe because simply putting it through an act of the state parliament means that those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bits can be excised. We know this happens on a regular basis. So 93 per cent of Australia is potentially claimable under mining lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the next map, we find that the mining lease area is potentially much greater than the area of native title; there are some explanations at the back. I seek leave to table the maps.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that our act preserves the fact of common law; who holds native title, what it consists of, is entirely a matter for the courts of Australia. It is a common law right. You would be the first to attack us if there were any suggestion that it should be converted to a statutory right and defined. It is left entirely to the courts to determine whether, how and in what way native title may survive or exist in relation to water, whether onshore or offshore. I look forward to the determination in that respect as much as you do. It may be that the Yorta Yorta case is the first determination of that kind. I await the findings of the court, along with everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have absolutely no idea what the purpose of this map is. I understand that you are extraordinarily hostile to the mining industry. Fortunately, most responsible Aboriginal leaders do not share your hostility.

It is the one great source of opportunity in terms of jobs and income for Aboriginal people in outback Australia. It is the absolute</PARA>

We would not be able to provide the sort of welfare benefits that you, on your side of the chamber, always seek to ensure that we provide. We would be a much impoverished country without the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you that mining occupies an infinitesimally tiny part of the continent. Less than half a per cent of the continent is actually occupied by mining. These resources are owned by all of us. The wealth generated by mining is for all of us, for all Australians, and without it we would be much impoverished.  Every less developed and poorer country in the world is desperate to attract the sort of mining development and expertise that we have. It is one of Australia's greatest industries. We are world leaders in mining. We should all be applauding the success of workers in the mining industry, many of whom are blue collar workers who would

I applaud the mining industry for its consistent attempts to ensure the involvement of Aboriginal people in mining projects. I have seen that at first hand around Australia.

Everybody moves their amendments and then talks generally to the subject. The chair, when it is appropriate, moves the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to the government's subdivision dealing with the management of water and air space. We have become conscious in government that there are difficulties and problems in relation to the management of water and the issue of native title, which we wish to rectify by this subdivision. As I say, I do not think there is any greater responsibility on our democratically elected governments than the management of our most precious resource, water, on behalf of us all. As an aside, I am a supporter of Australians for an Ecologically Sustainable Population because I think the water issue in this country is so critical. I do not see how Australia can sustain a big population with the water resources it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government's point of view and from the point of view of the responsibility of all governments, there is no more important issue. This is about ensuring that, on behalf of every Australian, water can be adequately and properly managed. The existing act made some attempt to recognise that responsibility. However, in our view, it does not go far enough. What section 212 in the current act does is legislate to confirm certain existing rights. It then states&mdash;I think this must have been an amendment moved on the run at the time&mdash;that native title cannot be impaired. There has been great confusion on the part of governments and others involved in the management of and rights to water issue as to what exactly that means. We clarify it by ensuring the operation of the non-extinguishment principle in relation to water management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these provisions, there is no opportunity or possibility of extinguishment of native title. In no way do we seek to constrain the right to bring common law claims in relation to water. As I say, that right is protected by section 24HA(4). The non-extinguishment principle applies to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern about section 212 in the current act is that it refers to the ownership of resources but is silent on the question of the management of resources. This is causing a great deal of concern and difficulty around the country for the fishing industry. Amateur fishermen are having considerable concerns about it. The professional fishing industry and other users of water as well as state and territory governments need to know exactly what they can and cannot do now that there is the imposition of this Commonwealth legislation. Section 24HA allows the ongoing management and regulation of water. We cannot freeze this as at the time of the current Native Title Act. That is part of the problem with section 212; it does not apply to rights granted after the commencement of the act. There is considerable doubt about how the proper responsibilities of state governments to manage water on behalf of us all are to be adequately performed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do think this provision and this section is necessary to ensure an ongoing future act regime in relation to the management of water and airspace according to the quite clear requirements laid down there, most particularly the non-extinguishment principle; the provision that native title holders concerned are entitled to compensation for any acts; provisions in relation to who pays the compensation, et cetera. Given that the ALP are the ones talking about certainty, if the opposition amendment to delete the whole subdivision H were to succeed, we think it will produce and sustain the current situation of considerable uncertainty in relation to the management of water in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this regime in place now for a couple of years. In fact, we have had this arrangement in place for over three years. For the minister to say that by going back to the regime that has been in existence over the last three or four years we would be falling into the area of uncertainty, unreliability and the end of rights as we know them in respect of water is really an argument with no substance at all. Senator Minchin, in the course of this debate you have not instanced one particular problem that has arisen from the current Native Title Act provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in the same way that you comprehensively tackle Aboriginal rights throughout this legislation, this is a sneaky, backdoor way of trying to limit native title interests and trying to render them basically ineffectual and ineffective. There is no justification for this. Section 24HA, your proposal in the bill, does not treat native title holders as significant stakeholders in water. Let's face it: in many instances, their very lives and livelihood depend on the rights to continued access to the waters we are talking about here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no justification. The scare campaign of `we will be falling into a regime of uncertainty' will not work. Let us keep the existing legislation. No-one has argued with any substance at all that the existing legislation has led to any problems. In fact, it has been quite useful. As I say, in terms of common law rights you have the Yorta Yorta case pending. That case is going to be quite critical. Why don't we let the common law develop?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the Democrats/Green (WA) amendments. They are substantially different from the ALP amendment. We would certainly want to press those amendments and to vote on them. Let me speak then to our amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision left open a number of major issues at common law, including whether traditional rights and interests regarding onshore and areas of sea and seabed may be recognised as Native Title Act title under the common law. The present Native Title Act 1993 leaves these issues, quite rightly, to the courts. The Croker seas and Yorta Yorta cases, which are presently before the Federal Court, are expected to clarify the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous fishing rights to onshore and offshore waters have been recognised. In overseas jurisdictions, in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, this included  rights to take fish for subsistence purposes and in some cases the right to trade or operate commercial fishing. As far back as 1905, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Indian tribes were not much less dependent upon fishing than the air they breathe. That case was United States v. Winans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New Zealand the Maoris have successfully negotiated joint ownership of Sealords Products Ltd, which owns 22 per cent of New Zealand's fishing quota. Recognition of these rights have enabled indigenous people to negotiate with government and commercial interests to ensure that they are a stakeholder in the process. This has included commercial fishing quotas that do not detract from subsis tence fishing. The proper mechanisms are in place to protect certain species and that pollution and overfishing are prevented.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10176">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cases indigenous people have negotiated a significant involvement in the fishing industry, such as a share of the harvest of certain species. If indigenous people are going to make the contribution they want to make to this country&mdash;a magnificent contribution which they are already making but which they want to extend&mdash;then we have to give them the opportunity to do these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a significant difference between our amendments and the amendment of the ALP. I noticed in the Labor Party's minority report that, in respect of offshore waters, the minority recommends deletion, in respect of future action, of the right to negotiate. It seems to me that your amendment does not reflect that view of the minority report. I am asking Senator Bolkus: is that so and why?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer that question. Senator Woodley, you are right. Since you were a co&hyphen;signatory to much of the report it is quite understandable that you would pick on that development in our policy. What we have said all along and what we will continue to say in respect of our response to Wik and to native title is that we have been developing, negotiating, discussing with all stakeholders to get an outcome which we think provides both certainty and a balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have talked through the question of offshore water. Let us remember that, at the moment, we are talking about essentially inshore water&mdash;the management of water and airspace. We have talked through the question of offshore water. In the same way, for instance, that we would like to see the development of the common law in respect of onshore water through the Yorta Yorta case, we have decided after further thought that we should take the same attitude in respect of offshore water. There are obviously cases involved there. The Croker Island case is the one that immediately comes to mind. Those cases will ensure a development of the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to wait in respect of offshore water to see how the common law develops. In the meantime, we are recommending, as you quite rightly picked, not a full right to negotiate but a right of notifica 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and consultation as a basic platform level of rights that should apply, depending, of course, on how the High Court develops the common law in respect of offshore water. We believe that is probably the most reasonable and appropriate response given the circumstances involved, but we are not in the business of cutting off the development of the common law in both offshore and onshore cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am on that point, it is important to recognise in respect of onshore waters&mdash;the water and airspace under the proposal we are discussing now&mdash;that we argue that the Senate needs to be consistent as well as we apply a benchmark across the spectrum of native title interests. We have acknowledged in this debate time and time again that native title is nothing unless you have a capacity to be able to claim that title or have a capacity to be involved in a decision in respect of the areas and the interests that you may possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular instance, we are contemplating a massive deviation from existing rights of native title holders. We can very easily render meaningless, render totally empty any right to particular waterways or access to waterways if we do not ensure that the native title claimants are a party in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to be consistent, the government's 24HA, which overrides the right to negotiate, has to be defeated. It has to be defeated if people in this place recognise the importance of the right to negotiate rights to native title. It is for this particular reason in this case that we are opposing the government's proposal 24HA. As I said earlier, we maintain that the Senate should continue with the current scheme in operation. I think I have answered three or four of your questions, Senator Woodley. I stress the last point I made in respect of this particular matter. If we were to adopt the government's proposal 24HA it would render the right to negotiate in respect of onshore water meaningless.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of specific questions to the minister. One relates to the issue that Senator Woodley has just cited of an offshore oil installation. Can you say whether or not your amendment extinguishes the right or potential right of Aboriginal people with an interest in, say, a fishing ground to negotiate or have a say under the law in the enabling of an oil drilling process? Secondly, can you say in regard to, for example, proposed dams on the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley or elsewhere&mdash;because there are a stack of these in northern Australia&mdash;whether your legislation extinguishes the rights that native title holders may have, at least in so far as their ability to negotiate, not compensation afterwards, the impact that such a proposal would have on them, their culture and their land is concerned?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume Senator Brown is aware that the current act does not provide for a right to negotiate offshore. There is no such thing. The ALP is not proposing to change that nor are we. We do not yet know whether native title can exist offshore. We are dealing with offshore places in block 11. We are not doing anything to prevent native title claims being brought offshore or to allow that matter to be heard. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think the Croker case will be the first one where that question may be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act, as I recall, basically gives native title holders procedural rights that are equivalent to others, and I do not think anybody is quite clear on what that means. There was certainly no attempt by this parliament previously to apply a right to negotiate offshore, nor are we or the opposition proposing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A dam would almost inevitably involve a compulsory acquisition of the area of land required. The normal provisions would apply if that was vacant crown land, then it would involve a right to negotiate in relation to the compulsory acquisition of whatever. Obviously, under the current act, compulsory acquisitions for government purposes do not involve a right to negotiate per se. Compulsory acquisitions for third parties involve a right to negotiate, but the current act does not give a statutory right to negotiate the compulsory acquisitions for government owned purposes. You have to think where it is, what land it is on, who is building it and what it is for. I am just giving you a running commentary on the current act in relation to the matters you raised with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in these provisions which, of themselves, `override the right to negotiate', as was asserted by Senator Bolkus. It is important to remember that these provisions do not extinguish native title. The non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies. Claims can still be brought through all the auspices of the act for native title and native title determinations made. We are simply ensuring that governments elected by us and acting on behalf of all of us can into the future manage that water for all of us under a certain regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no certainty about the regime currently operating, and you have only to talk to state governments who have that responsibility at the moment and the fishing industry itself to know that there is considerable uncertainty about what can and cannot be done at the moment. All this seeks to do is ensure that a certain regime applies into the future in relation to the management regulation of water, very clearly, on the non- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10178">extinguishment principle and with full compensation for any impact on native title.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="10178" TIME="9.17 p.m." SPEAKER="Brown, Sen Bob" NAMEID="QD4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="AG" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, while I understand you to say these provisions of the government's do not extinguish native title&mdash;and I do not think anybody has said they would&mdash;the concern I have is that they extinguish a potential right, or a real right, to negotiate, not just the compensation after the act but the proposal. For example, on an inland waterway like the Fitzroy River, I understand you to say that these provisions by the government will extinguish the right or the ability of people to negotiate the building of a dam, not the right of people to have a claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would have very big consequences for native title claimants or holders&mdash;their ability to fish in the locality of the dam, their ability to fish downstream of that locality and their access to sites in that area which may be of great significance, and remember their settlement has always concentrated on water. It goes without saying. Minister, I would like you to clearly tell the committee if that is the case&mdash;that is, in the building of dams on northern rivers, the native title claimants or holders will have no right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is about potential native title claims or acknowledgment of rights over the seas. As you quite rightly say, this has been perhaps determined in the courts. I am concerned about the situation where the courts find that native title claimants are in fact able to claim the seas, very important to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Is this amendment that you have here then going to tie the hands of those people in being able to, for example, ward off an oil drill being brought into the area which they have successfully claimed, with all the threats that that means for their traditional fishing grounds offshore?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat: the current situation with regard to the right to negotiate is that it applies to mining and compulsory acquisitions for third parties. Those are the circumstances or activities that trigger the right to negotiate. That is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current arrangement. So it does not apply when a government compulsorily acquires land for its own purposes. Under the current act, if a government is building a dam, the right to negotiate does not apply. That is simply a statement of what occurs at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of rights over the seas, we are talking here about management, not extinguishment. We would argue strongly that, if native title exists offshore, it can only amount to a coexisting right, given the authority of governments over the seas to manage them on behalf of all of us. We do not believe it is possible to assert a claim for exclusive possession over the seas, but certainly it may be. In relation to the question of whether native title can exist offshore, we do not know yet but, if it can, it could not possibly amount to more than a coexisting right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the law in relation to this matter must take that into account. In that sense, we believe it essential that governments can continue their proper responsibility on behalf of all of us to issue statutory rights to fish, whether it is to Aboriginal people or to others, in their management of the resource on behalf of all of us, but it must be in a way that does not amount to the extinguishment of common law rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear as a matter of common law that governments under Mabo and Wik have the right to issue statutory rights. We are saying that, where they do so, in accordance with Mabo and Wik the statutory rights prevail. But, unlike Mabo and Wik, in the future those statutory rights will not extinguish native title. That is the case with the management of water. You cannot effect an extinguishment except by compulsory acquisition. You cannot do it by the issue of other rights as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply repeat that this is a critically important issue for us. We do think that the potential for the fishing industry is enormous. It provides enormous opportunities for Aboriginal people themselves and for the nation as a whole. We are setting down here an appropriate regime for the management of those  resources and of water itself into the future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10179"> which we believe is a deficiency in the current act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a little while ago the minister said that the states have said that there is uncertainty, therefore, we need to act. The states have never wanted Mabo; they have never wanted a Native Title Act; they have always claimed there was uncertainty; and they have always wanted to extinguish native title interests. We do not always have to act when the states demand that we act. What we need to do is take a dispassionate overview and see when they are in the right and when they are in the wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to take a dispassionate national overview in respect of this area of the debate, you would recognise that in current live proceedings in the Federal Court in the Yorta Yorta case there is an argument as to the right to negotiate in respect of inland water resources. That is a very live argument and it is one that the courts will determine in the not too distant future, hopefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">States have claimed there is uncertainty and whatever. They have always said that. When the law was laid down and made very clear to them, as it was in the Waanyi case, they still did not pursue the certainty of the law, except for Western Australia, which did so after the Waanyi case. Other states should have done so as well because the High Court made it very clear in that case what the law was. We would not have half the problems we have now if the states had followed the certainty of the law as laid down by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This argument about the states saying that it is uncertain does not really wash and should not wash in this place. What should wash is the fact that this proposal cannot be substantiated and cannot be justified. According to most evidence to the parliament, section 212 is operating pretty well. Whatever deficiencies there may be in it, they do not justify this overriding of a potential right to negotiate and they do not justify rendering indigenous interests as virtually worthless in this process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the government is proposing here is a total overreach in that it allows almost any action over any water to constitute a future act. It does do what I have not heard of native title doing in any part of the world; that is, restrict the right of native title claimants to claim native title and to have access to fishing. It is just almost unbelievable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 24HA(1)(b) and 2(b)(ii) both say `living aquatic resources'. It would be very interesting to see if what this government is suggesting is that, at some stage, they can envisage&mdash;and perhaps the minister can please advise me that this is not the case&mdash;traditional owners being in breach of some law, arrested or put in prison for accessing traditional fishing rights. If they do not have access to native title over fishing areas, it is going to be difficult for them to fish and hunt, especially fish. If they do not have access to native title, how could they be guaranteed access to those traditional methods of existence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed government amendments will deny native title holders the right to negotiate. Senator Boswell, it is not the right to veto; it is the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is not the same as the right to veto. The amendments will provide only the most minimum procedural requirement available to them before the government takes action which may permanently deprive them of their rights to fish or use waters or to prevent desecration of sacred sites in, for example, wetlands, waterholes and rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is most significant to many native title holders. On the one hand, there are many locations across Australia where the only likely remaining native title rights reside in waters because the greater area has had native title extinguished by the grant of exclusive possession. Therefore, the proposed amendments will effectively provide the final act for dispossession of those people. How can we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10182"> find anything in this act which distinguishes the Australia of today from our colonial past? Where is the fair and just outcome for these people in this bill? Where can it be seen that their remnant rights are respected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under traditional law and custom, there is no differentiation between rights in land and rights in waters. There is no doubt about that, and I would like to quote Senator Harradine. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a right to negotiate . . . is to be enjoyed by native title holders whose country is vacant crown land, that right should not be taken away from native title holders who suffer the disadvantage of having their land subject to a pastoral lease without their consent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to thank Senator Harradine for those words. Under the same principle, this place must ask the question: if a right to negotiate is to be enjoyed by native title holders whose country is vacant crown land, why should that right be taken away from native title holders who suffer the disadvantage of having their only remaining native title rights removed or affected without their consent simply because these rights reside in waters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is, in the main, a dry continent and, as such, waters are of essential significance to native title holders. Many people traverse the country from waterhole to waterhole or up and down watercourses and rivers. Water was not only essential for survival but provided important places for meetings, ceremonies and trading between different groups. Such waters provide a very important social role for people, which is integrally linked to traditional relationships, law and customs. Waters have been traditionally used for a wide range of activities&mdash;from recreational places and harvest plants to traditional medicines and burial places and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current act, any grant of new rights is subject to the future act regime by which native title holders must be accorded the same procedural rights as they would be if they possessed freehold title. The proposed amendments are a significant impairment on existing rights and are likely to be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no question that water and places around water have traditionally and customarily been of economic, social, recreational, educational, ceremonial and spiritual importance. People are also traditionally responsible for caring for, and looking after, waters and land around them. Waters and land are integrally related in a traditional way. Remember, the land belongs to the people, and the people belong to the land. It is a two-way process. Any attempt to preclude claimants from carrying out their responsibilities in caring for waters is unjustifiable and shows a complete lack of understanding of native title itself.</PARA>

This is about the future management of water in such a way that does enable coexistence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are discovering here is, as Senator Margetts says, a very critical component of this debate. Senator Boswell has said that the water is the lifeblood of regional Australia. It certainly is the lifeblood of the indigenous people's interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that we are moving into an area where there is going to be enormous pressure on those water resources, particularly in northern Australia. The minister has adverted to that already by saying that the government wants to have a controlling interest in what happens to those waters on behalf of various interests. But we know that will ultimately mean on behalf of developmental interests and against the indigenous interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to Senator Minchin that in the event that the courts establish that there are native title rights over offshore waters, this government amendment effectively extinguishes those rights in big degree. For example, if a government were to legislate that a fishing company had the exclusive fishing rights to waters that had been subject to claim and where there had been a native right established, that would cut right across the essential component of that right as far as livelihood is concerned. There would be nothing the indigenous people could do about it because here in this section, if it passes this parliament, is the extinguishment of the right to negotiate about that fishing interest in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same also applies to onshore waters, to rivers, billabongs and wetlands. Developments affecting these waters will not be ones that indigenous interests can effectively stand up against. They will be hamstrung. Their rights and powers are cut away by this particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government amendment. There is no doubt about that; that is what this amendment says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin ducked and weaved to a degree about the question on dams, but if legislation comes through for the establishment of private dams, if private developers are able to tweak the ear of governments and say, `We need legislation to enable us to dam these waters,' this section says that their rights prevail and the indigenous rights retreat. Nothing that the minister has said has given me any confidence that it is otherwise than that. As Senator Margetts said, we are down to a crucial issue here for the future; that is, the indigenous interest in the waters, the lifeblood, as Senator Boswell said, right across that area of Australia which Mr Howard has referred to as `potentially available for claim'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now add to that the offshore waters, the sea fisheries and the cultural interests that the Aboriginal people have in offshore areas as well. Under this section, all of these interests, as far as indigenous people are concerned, become subsidiary to the developers of the future. There is no doubt that that is what this section is saying. If we allow it to pass, that indigenous interest will be effectively subordinated, if not eliminated by this government amendment. It is pivotal, it is crucial and we all need to think very carefully about this before we allow the government to have sway. That is why we are moving, in this corner of the Senate, to amend this section, to restore the indigenous interest and to make sure that it is not made subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that that is why the opposition is moving simply to oppose what the government is doing because it has enormous untoward ramifications for the future as far as the indigenous interests in those lifeblood waters onshore and offshore are concerned.</PARA></SPEECH>

That subdivision envisages that any native title rights may be recognised by the High Court and that any native title rights that may be recognised by the High Court can be acquired.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here of a government moving to stifle the development of the common law in respect to offshore. We are also talking of a government which is trying to remove indigenous people's rights in respect of the intertidal zone by removing the right to negotiate in respect of the intertidal zone. This, of course, is a right currently existing under the Native Title Act. We are concerned that the government's legislation is unnecessary. To the extent that it extinguishes the right to negotiate, it obviously has a similar effect on the rights that are being consequently extinguished by the extinguishment of that right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposal will have a major impact on indigenous people's traditional fishing and shellfish gatherings in the intertidal zone area and in offshore places, of course, if the High Court rules that native title to some extent does exist offshore. In short, this can be described as a gratuitous attempt to limit the ability of native title holders to assert and pursue their claims. It is that sort of typical government response that says, `Oh, well, let's just buy them off; money will do the job.' But you do not really appreciate that there is more than money involved here. Native title interests emanate from a whole range of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that this is a gratuitous attempt to limit people's ability to assert their claims. It also raises a number of inconsistencies. You are trying to pre&hyphen;empt the common law and you are trying to override the right to negotiate in respect of the intertidal zone. When you look at some of the arrangements along Australia's shoreline already, for instance, at Shoalwater Bay, indigenous people have under agreement with the federal government a right to continue traditional practices in respect of those intertidal waters. I think it is also in respect of waters in excess of the intertidal zone. Basically what you are trying to do here is overturn that sort of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting in this debate that what the government is doing here is in contradistinction to the Torres Strait treaty of 1984 whereby the Commonwealth `protected the traditional fishing activities of the inhabitants 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10187"> of Papua New Guinea and created a protected zone in the Torres Strait'. If the government's amendments tonight are passed, then Australia's indigenous citizens will have similar traditional rights extinguished&mdash;rights that are recognised by treaty, rights for people from the Torres Strait and Papua New Guinea and rights that are recognised by agreement with indigenous claimants in respect of other parts of Australia. This government is trying to extinguish those rights in a broad general sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are doing is seeking to amend subdivision N to ensure that there are minimum standards for notification and consultation with native title claimants about acts carried out offshore. These standards will ensure that, if native title is found to apply offshore, the interests of native title holders are taken into account and they are properly notified, consulted and involved in respect of any acts that may give rise to compensation. We will apply the non-extinguishment principle to the acquisition of native title rights on offshore waters. We will also move amendments to maintain the current regime&mdash;that is, the right to negotiate regime&mdash;in respect of the intertidal zone waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government is, once again, trying to stop the development of common law rights here. It is something that we should all be concerned about. It has immediate effect on people's rights and practices.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned before that water rights are fundamental to the traditional economies of all coastal indigenous people in Australia. Their right to preserve their access to the sea and to protect traditional fishing grounds is even more important because of the level of dispossession of so much of their land. For many generations, governments encouraged sole dependence on the sea as a means of facilitating that dispossession. The same situation applies along inland rivers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special importance of the sea to indigenous people has been acknowledged by the Resource Assessment Commission in its 1993 report on the coastal zone. The threats include not only fishing but also oil and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mineral activities. So we are talking about the impact of other activities on those rights. Like the seas, inland rivers and waterholes are, as I have mentioned, very often the location of the most spiritually significant places to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see that overuse by other interests may in fact cause environmental disasters and destroy sacred places&mdash;and that can be sea as well as inland river overuse. The development that goes with that kind of activity can also restrict access to important areas. The right to negotiate is the minimum protection which can be afforded to indigenous people, giving them some say in how future proposals affect their traditional sea and river country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canada, New Zealand and the United States have each afforded their indigenous people a level of protection for their marine estates which go well beyond that currently existing in Australia. The current act does not deal adequately with native title over places beyond the limits of a state or territory&mdash;that is, areas not covered as onshore places. The only relevant provisions are those which allow a government to confirm its ownership of natural resources and to confirm public access to coastal water&mdash;that is, sections 212(1)(a) and 212(2)(c). Native title fishing and hunting rights are preserved by section 211.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to deal with offshore resources which are or may be subject to native title should be addressed. The bill would allow them to be extinguished without any procedural fairness, or to be regulated out of existence. What we are talking about here is the need to allow native title holders to be heard when decisions are made concerning the exploitation of resources and the granting of fishing licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the right to negotiate is not to be provided, the constructive approach should remain and the indigenous land use agreements could provide that relevant mechanism. In any event, this subdivision, at the very least, should be omitted. It is internally inconsistent. It will apply only to land outside states and territories, but it envisages the application of their compulsory acquisition laws and is grossly discriminatory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10188">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore indicate that whilst I would prefer to see the Greens&hyphen;Democrat amendment carried, this is so important to so many of the indigenous people&mdash;groups and representatives&mdash;we have spoken to over the last few days and weeks that, at the very least, we would urge the removal of the section in the bill to not prejudice and to not have negative implications for future common law decisions and to make sure that people know what the situation is in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I am a little surprised by the hyperbole surrounding this provision, because it simply does restate in a separate division the current provisions in the Native Title Act regarding offshore places. We can put to one side the debate we can have later about the right to negotiate in relation to the intertidal zone. That is nothing to do with these provisions. That relates to the right to negotiate&mdash;and we are happy to have that debate&mdash;but it has absolutely nothing to do with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act does not provide a future act regime in relation to offshore waters. That is the current position. That is continued, but what we do is simply restate the proper regime to apply in relation to offshore places. We maintain the procedural rights arrangements that are provided for in the current act in 23(6)(b), exactly the same procedural rights that are currently provided. The same arrangements apply with relation to compensation. The arrangements in relation to extinguishment are the same in the sense that, to the extent that if there would need to be a compulsory acquisition, that can occur. And that is the only basis on which there could be extinguishment, otherwise the non-extinguishment principle applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is simply regulating in a different way in restructuring the act what is currently the case. Nothing in our scheme at all determines the question of whether or not native title exists offshore. That is left entirely to the courts, as I say, by these provisions. It is simply restating that the statutory arrangements should apply to the extent that native 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> title is found to exist offshore. As I say, that is entirely left to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe this subdivision should stand as printed. We do not believe there is justification for the amendments proposed. We certainly do not believe that the ALP should now go beyond what it did before, so as to say that the validity of offshore acts should be conditional upon the satisfactory implementation of procedural rights. That was never in the original Native Title Act, and we do not believe that should be done now. It would create massive uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of opposition amendment 109, we are simply continuing the current law in relation to extinguishment. Where a compulsory acquisition occurs, that is the only way in which extinguishment can take place, but that has to be possible. Again, opposition amendment 110 is inconsistent with the current provisions which we restate, which are contained in 23(6)(b). We therefore believe that subdivision N should stand as printed and do not support any of the opposition amendments. We propose some amendments of our own, which I now move:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 31 is an amendment to proposed subsection 24NA(3), which provides that native title offshore can be extinguished by a non&hyphen;discriminatory compulsory acquisition. A requirement of such non&hyphen;discriminatory process is that non&hyphen;native title interests are also acquired. The amendment removes the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' from this requirement with regard to non&hyphen;native title interests. That is in response to concerns expressed by some that the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' may in some way be discriminatory or permit compulsory acquisitions that are discriminatory. That is not our intention and we want to clarify that so that what applies onshore applies offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 32 is an amendment to proposed subsection 24NA(3). The amendment requires that the practices and procedures adopted in relation to a non&hyphen;discriminatory compulsory acquisition do not cause native title holders to be any more disadvantaged than the holders of other rights and interests where their rights are also acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 33 adjusts the provision which allows the Commonwealth to pass on native title compensation liabilities to third parties. It will make it clear that if a law of the Commonwealth states that a third party is liable for compensation, then that third party, not the Commonwealth, is liable. Amendment 34 is in similar terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking to do is simply to restructure the act to accommodate the existing arrangements in relation to offshore in this subdivision for ease of dealing with this often quite difficult act, where particular parts are spread throughout. This pulls the provisions of the current act together in one section. We believe they are the appropriate provisions and should stand. This has nothing to do with the right to negotiate per se in the intertidal zone. We can deal with that under the rights to negotiate.</PARA></SPEECH>

Is it looking at the potential for purchase of offshore areas to which indigenous people have native title rights in terms of fishing or is it looking at the potential for offshore places which might be affected by dredging, by the building of jetties or by other works that the Commonwealth or state deem to be important enough to require compulsory acquisition&mdash;remembering that this is compulsory acquisition without the right of the native title holders to negotiate?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current act contemplates the possibility of compulsory acquisitions occurring offshore, as does ours. I honestly cannot imagine in what circumstances a state government or the Commonwealth government would need to exercise its compulsory acquisition powers.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any state government that it has in mind anything that would fit within this category. As I say, it is a restatement of what is currently the case and what is currently allowed under the act, where it simply acknowledges the fact that governments, Commonwealth and state, have compulsory acquisition powers that need to be accommodated by an act of the extraordinary breadth and impact of the Native Title Act. It provides the mechanisms by which those sorts of powers are to be exercised. As I say, they have to be non-discriminatory and acquire all rights and interests concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the minister that the government is looking at the potential for a court ruling to find that there are offshore native title rights. This is preparation for state and territory governments to be sure that, in the eventuality that native title rights are found to be valid offshore&mdash;this, in particular, includes fishing rights&mdash;governments will be able to acquire those rights. I find that a matter of some concern because, to me, it simply appears to be covering the potential for taking away, through compulsory acquisition, rights which are potentially to be found for indigenous people offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It looks to me as though the government is preparing for what it would see as an adverse finding by the courts. It is what we here might see as a logical finding for the courts; that is, that there are indeed offshore rights for native title claimants. Indigenous people do not find a line in the sand as far as their territory, culture and interests are concerned. The sea, the shore and the land are all part of a continuum. It is just in our legislation that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10191"> we find the need for sectioning these things up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a question mark over native title rights offshore. That again is a fixture of the Western law mentality. It is quite a foreign concept to indigenous people that there is any division between the seas and the lands as far as law is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does concern me that this section is strengthening up any government's ability to compulsorily acquire those rights, if they are found to exist, without the ability of indigenous people to negotiate. Tell me if I am wrong, but I believe that there is no right to negotiate to come out of this amendment, as the government puts it. But if the compulsory acquisition goes ahead, the only thing that can be talked out is the monetary compensation at the end of the day. For many indigenous people with whom I have spoken, that is a very secondary consideration to their traditional rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Scare campaigns are often based on interpretations of the truth and sometimes on a steady diet of misrepresentations. So it is when there is an examination of the issue of whether freehold land may be claimed under the processes set up by the Native Title Act 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned last week in this place, there are currently 27 native title claims in South Australia lodged with the Native Title Tribunal. It is absolutely crucial to understand that less than a dozen of these claimant applications explicitly exclude freehold tenure from the bounds of their claim. The remaining claims, including those by the Eringa, Kuyani, Dieri, Coultard, Yalata, Maralinga and Yankunytjatjara people, do not explicitly exclude any freehold land that is situated within the boundaries of the claim area. In fact, in many cases, these claims instead include an all encompassing statement that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the application excludes any areas which may have been the subject of extinguishing events or, to the extent of the impairment, areas the subject of events which may have impaired native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the claimant group has left the door open&mdash;they have retained the ability to subsequently claim freehold if the courts give them that opportunity. The language of `impairment' and not `extinguishment' is used&mdash;consistent with the view raised by some of the High Court judges that native title may revive after the expiry of a validly granted title including grants of freehold. I repeat: the majority of these native title claims in South Australia therefore leave the door open to the possibility of claiming freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, should the common law at some future point in time determine that native title may 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10192"> survive or revive over freehold land, these claims provide for that opportunity. Of course Justice French's statement last week&mdash;and Gareth Evans's as well&mdash;confirmed that this is an issue that has not yet been specifically resolved by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also examples of claims in South Australia lodged with the tribunal that currently do include freehold land. However, the town of Ceduna, which I mentioned last week in this place as being the subject of a native title claim over freehold, is in fact excluded in the detail of the claim, while being, to say the least, confusing on the maps that are available. However, the Nukunu peoples' claim does cover extensive areas of freehold. In fact, this particular claim covers the South Australian cities and towns of Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Crystal Brook, Gladstone, Wilmington, Quorn and Jamestown&mdash;a fairly large part of the north of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This claimant application states that it is subject to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to any validly granted freehold land situated within the area of the land the subject of the application, the applicants do not claim any native title they or their predecessors in native title may have held which&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is the important part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was extinguished by the valid grant of freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they claim native title over all the freehold land which may be eventually found not to have been extinguished. It is significant that this wording is quite different from that in the documents lodged by many other native title claimants in South Australia. This carefully drafted legal phrasing deliberately leaves the door open to claiming all of those areas of freehold land should the High Court at some point in the future find, albeit to everybody's surprise, as the case with Wik, that the grant of freehold does not necessarily extinguish all native title rights or, alternatively, that native title may revive on reversion of freehold land to the crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other claims in South Australia are even more explicit in claiming freehold land. The Dieri and Yandruwandha peoples' claim, lodged as recently as August 1997, purports on the surface to exclude freehold in accord 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance with the tribunal's guidelines. However, interestingly enough, the claim goes on to state the following caveat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The applicants reserve their rights to seek to amend in the event of those guidelines being found to be too narrow in their scope.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, they explicitly reserve the right to claim freehold should the High Court find that this is possible in a future test case. Yet another group concedes that this is a live issue. The claim by the Wangkangurru and Yarluyandi peoples use precisely the same wording in their claim and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the same lawyers are looking after both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a far cry from the statements this week claiming that claims on freehold land have been repudiated. These also sound frighteningly familiar to those of us who were here in 1993 when various parties said similar things in relation to native title claims over pastoral leases being categorically ruled out, to quote the words of Mr Noel Pearson. The existence of these claim documents which have been lodged with the tribunal registrar also show that the tribunal is not properly following its own procedures and guidelines. Those procedures are supposed to prevent claims being lodged over freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, the president of the tribunal, Mr Justice French, released a two-page statement on native title and freehold land, strongly asserting that under the Native Title Act 1993 a valid grant of freehold title will always extinguish native title. Aboriginal activists have also been waving around a previous media release from Justice French headed `Tribunal rejects claims over private freehold'. Even overlooking the heading, which implicitly confirms that claims may be made over public freehold land, it cannot simply be reconciled with previous statements made by Justice French which do not measure up with his latest claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice French told the parliamentary joint committee on native title that `no coherent theory of extinguishment has yet emerged from the various judicial decisions' and that the possibility of native title reviving on freehold land which reverts to the Crown is still a live issue. It strikes me as curious and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10193"> puzzling, to say the least, for the tribunal's president to, on the one hand, concede that native title claims may have been made over freehold land and to state that the issue is yet to be resolved by the High Court and to, on the other hand, make strong statements asserting that native title claims simply cannot be made over freehold land. It begs the question: how do we resolve this uncertainty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice French went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If claims have been subsequently registered which do include freehold, it is because that freehold was not apparent on the face of the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal is not empowered generally to rely upon information provided by governments or others or to search for such information outside the framework of the application before deciding to accept an application . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The current procedures set up under Labor's legislation therefore mean that whatever the claimants assert must be accepted as fact, and is being accepted as fact by the tribunal. It is quite an extraordinary situation, I would have thought, and of little comfort to those families in regional Australia when multiple claims arrive in the roadside mail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to discuss the issue of the caller number display option. This week in my home state of South Australia and my home city of Adelaide the residents are being used as guinea pigs as Telstra trials its calling number display option. One person said to me yesterday that this is the service that most people never knew they needed. Indeed, when Leigh McLuskey on 5AA interviewed a Telstra representative she said, `Remind me again exactly why we need this particular service?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear that the Australian Democrats are not disputing the right of telecommunications carriers or industries to introduce such a service and acknowledge that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there may be benefits associated with an option such as calling number display. Obviously, those benefits might include whether or not you choose to take a call based on the knowledge of who is calling. Certainly it has been put forward that parents would be able to have the benefit of knowing if their child was calling and from what location they are calling, et cetera. I state on the record that my party would have preferred if this service had been offered as an opt in as opposed to an opt out service, but it is going ahead regardless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are most concerned about&mdash;in fact downright scared of&mdash;some of the privacy implications as a result of the introduction of calling number display. We are particularly concerned that the target levels of public awareness about calling number display&mdash;public awareness as to not only the service but also the blocking options associated with it&mdash;have not been achieved. We are also very concerned that the research into whether or not these targets have been met has been made only selectively available publicly&mdash;and selectively available to a point where the result given, I think, is potentially misleading in their evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are dangers associated with the calling number display service. I would argue that these privacy dangers and concerns might outweigh some of those so-called benefits that have been put forward by the government and by the telecommunications industries, especially, of course, if people are unaware of the privacy implications associated with this service. The dangers can be anything from women's shelters, which have expressed their concerns about confidential listings being accessed by people, or more generally the use to which the calling number display option and its associated information can be used by telemarketing companies and other organisational users. The privacy foundation has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CND allows organisations such as businesses and government agencies to keep a record of the contact time and call number whenever a person makes a call. They can automatically reverse match the calling number with either their own records or an electronic phone directory, allowing the organisation to record where someone is calling from (and potentially who they are) before they have even had the opportunity to speak to anyone and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10194"> without the caller knowing. This sort of use of CND has made it one of the more controversial privacy issues in recent years in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats first raised this issue with the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) on 30 October. We raised it in question time on 19 November and the minister has acknowledged some of our concerns and responded to them&mdash;not normally in question time, I might add, but normally in a belated form in a media release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those releases, the minister has assured me and my colleagues that the appropriate consumer safeguards would be in place and that carriers would be expected to conform to those safeguards. That was before calling number display was introduced. The Australian Communications Industry Forum, ACIF, code of practice is not in place. I think the minister thought mistakenly that it might be in place by 1 December, which is when the Telstra service was due to start. I would not be very surprised if we do not see this for at least another six months. The minister claimed that, regardless of whether the codes were in place, there would be interim protection&mdash;that is, through the Austel principles and guidelines&mdash;and consumer information and consumer privacy would be safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a far cry from the original belief by some, including the minister, that the draft guidelines for a code would be available prior to the introduction of CND on 1 December. As I mentioned, it looks as if a draft guideline will not be available for at least six months after the introduction of this particular service. It does not really matter what assurances the minister is giving members of the public, me or my party, because there is still a privacy vacuum in Australia, and specifically within the telecommunications industry. We all know that this vacuum would not be there if we had national, consistent, uniform or enforceable privacy laws in this country, just as was promised by the coalition prior to the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, honourable senators have heard me discussing this issue many times in this place. We know that in September last year the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) promised 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation would be introduced to extend privacy laws to the private sector. He said, `I intend to be in a position to develop legislation for introduction next year.' However, as many of us know, there was a backflip in March this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), no less, when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I took the opportunity of today's Premiers Conference to raise the Commonwealth's concerns regarding proposals to implement a privacy regime for the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will not be implementing privacy legislation for the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Regardless of the reasons for this particular backflip, or backdown&mdash;and I might say I have had very few rational arguments put to me by the government as to why this backdown has taken place&mdash;it does not take away from the fact that the government has created this crucial privacy vacuum in law in this country in a number of sectors, not the least of which is telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the minister's expectations that calling number display options would not be introduced until the requisite levels of public awareness were achieved. The minister in fact and in writing has endorsed the Austel guidelines. I note that in its 1996 January report, Austel recommended that calling number display should not be introduced&mdash;that is, it should be allowed on an opt out basis, and we acknowledge that is the case, even though we would prefer it to be an opt in basis&mdash;until a public awareness education campaign was conducted and an 80 per cent public awareness of the following three points was achieved. Those three points include the awareness of the introduction of CND&mdash;the displaying of phone numbers&mdash;the privacy implications of sending a number before the phone is answered and the fact that the number may be captured by organisational users and how consumers manage their personal privacy by opting out of sending their number through call blocking&mdash;line and call options&mdash;regardless of whether they subscribe to the calling number display services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it turns out, Telstra's own figures, released by the minister last week, reveal that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10195"> these targets have not been achieved. So less than 80 per cent of awareness in those areas has been achieved. It looks as though we are on track to achieve more than an 80 per cent awareness of the actual introduction of the service, but that does not necessarily mean that people understand the privacy implications associated with the introduction of that particular service; hence the delay by at least two weeks by Telstra of calling number display.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a problem. There is some reason to doubt the methodology and the research that has been involved in trying to capture or attain the levels of public awareness, and add to that the fact that the full results have not been made available in their entirety. I should state today that Tim Dixon, the key member of the Privacy Foundation, on behalf of the Telstra reference panel&mdash;who, I might add, note in their press release that a gag has been put on them&mdash;outlined the fact that not only have these public awareness figures not been met but Telstra has fallen significantly short of the targets of awareness of privacy implications and blocking, which they unanimously conclude. They have urged Telstra to defer the introduction of CND until the awareness of targets are achieved, and they have stated that the awareness targets cannot be achieved until Telstra specifically informs its customers of how organisations will capture and use their telephone number, as explicitly required by the PAC report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We call on the government to provide to the chamber all the Telstra results, the full methodology of those surveys, including sampling techniques and details of all questions, and the rejection rates of all those surveys. We call on Telstra to delay the introduction of this service. It is not an urgent service, and it has dire and dangerous privacy implications. We call on this government to do something about the privacy vacuum that exists in our law, to do something about ensuring that we have nationally consistent, uniform and enforceable privacy standards so that the introduction of smart cards, genetic testing or, in this case, calling number display is not done in a way that scares the community or leaves consumers vulnerable.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.49 p.m." PAGE="10195"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.49 p.m.</EMPHASIS>
