<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Earlier this week the Senate resolved that I should table certain documents that were being held by my department and also documents being held by the Australian Heritage Commission. Notwithstanding the fact that only six hours notice was given from the time of passage of the resolution to when the Senate ordered the documents to be produced, which was quite incredible, officials have worked long and hard to gather these documents&mdash;in one night, I know, working until 3 a.m. It has been at obviously quite a considerable cost&mdash;many thousands of dollars. Nevertheless, I obtained the documents yesterday and was able to check them last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, however, a number of the documents are `owned'&mdash;if it is the right expression&mdash;by other ministers, in particular the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson. He was out of Canberra last night and is returning to Canberra about now, and it is not my intention to table them until he has had an opportunity to look at them. I think that is not only the courteous way to proceed but also in accordance with normal practice.</PARA></SPEECH><SSO PAGE="4081"><TITLE>Suspension of Standing Orders</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent her moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion of censure of the Minister for the Environment in relation to his failure to comply with an order of the Senate for the production of documents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason I have moved this motion is that it is a very serious matter. Just now we have had the Minister for the Environment indicat
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing that there was six hours notice. That is patently untrue. The notice was given on Wednesday, 14 May.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CAMPBELL" NAMEID="H15">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When was the motion passed?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wednesday, 14 May was when the notice was given. I agreed to a request from Senator Hill on Thursday, 15 May&mdash;the day on which I would have sought to have the motion declared formal&mdash;to defer consideration of the motion for one week. You would think that any reasonable person, having asked for a deferral, would be saying, `Yes; let's get this under way; let's get this prepared; let's get people looking at the documents.' Oh, no. He said, `Let's wait until the last six hours and let's turn around to the Senate and try and give that story to the Senate'&mdash;as if that is the correct way for a minister to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I deferred for one week and I believed it was a very reasonable action. On Monday, 26 May, the Senate agreed to the motion calling for the production of these documents. On Wednesday, 27 May, the same Senator Hill made a statement saying, `Yesterday, the Senate ordered that I table certain documents in the Senate'. He said, `I wanted to advise the Senate that my department is moving expeditiously' and that he would have them ready for the Senate `tomorrow'. That was Wednesday. `Tomorrow' came and went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now been told that they are now beginning to think that they might belong to other ministers. This is a nonsense. When those documents were mentioned on 14 May it might have been a good time to check with other ministers, if those documents were collected from other ministers. This is contempt of the Senate. What is happening is that the minister is trying to bury his own complicity in this whole shoddy nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you remember the debate which actually led to the issue in the first place? The debate was about advice that was given by the Australian Heritage Commission in 1994. The minister said, `You're wrong; I have got more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date advice.' So it is an entirely reasonable thing for the Senate to ask for that more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date advice if that minister is going to use the fact that he has more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4082"> advice in a debate to say that I am wrong,  that he and the states have done the right thing in relation to their decisions to propose to woodchip an extraordinarily ecologically valuable piece of forest in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia. It was the minister himself who said, `I have got more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. They have been fully part of the process.' Isn't it reasonable for the Senate to say, `Okay, you say they have been fully part of the process; you've got more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date advice; where is it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the contempt of the Senate. I did not even receive a phone call about this this morning. I could not get the minister on the phone last night because he did not return the call to say that this is what was going to happen this morning. All I knew was that he was taking the documents home. Wouldn't you think somebody in that department would have thought, `Oh, these documents belong to other ministers'? This is a nonsense. Somebody is trying to bury information in this process. And guess what? We will end up with a whole list&mdash;if we ever get the documents&mdash;of those things which somehow or other have got a little query on them saying `commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence'. What it means is `buried' or `trying to hide'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the delay is. The delay is in somebody searching for anything that might actually led to the conclusion which most of us know is true: that the Australian Heritage Commission have not been fully involved in this process and have been very concerned, and that the federal bodies have not been doing the right thing. If this is not the case, come clean. In the meantime, I urge the Senate to support this motion. You will not hear the last of me until we receive every one of those documents.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing this and I will seek, in as short a time as possible so as not to delay the Senate, to explain why. Senator Margetts's office was contacted on innumerable occasions yesterday and explained to in minute, open, honest and frank detail just where the documents were at,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what stage the process was at. Discussions were held between the chief of staff in the office of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and staff in Senator Margetts's office, explaining all the way through the day exactly the process and where the documents were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister wanted to review the documents. He said that there is another minister who should review the documents this morning. The minister was held up in an all&hyphen;day meeting with environment groups from all around Australia. Senator Margetts, I would imagine, was suggesting that Senator Hill should have withdrawn from the meeting with the national environment groups so that he could have gone back to his office and gone through a half&hyphen;foot high pile of documents just to satisfy her demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact of the matter is that the government was open, honest and extremely communicative with Senator Margetts's office throughout the day. Last night, I understand as I was part of those discussions with Senator Margetts's office&mdash;I spoke to her office and her twice last night&mdash;as part of that process the minister's chief of staff rang Senator Margetts's office about seven or half past seven and explained that the documents could not have been tabled last night for a range of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first information this morning was from a call to say Senator Margetts was jumping up and down again and threatening to suspend standing orders, call quorums all day long and disrupt the Senate if we do not get these documents in. There are a few ways of doing business around this place, and one of them is to have absolute anarchy and to have quorums called every 10 minutes by someone who wants to throw a tantrum because a minister wants to go through responsible processes and make sure the documents are here. I told Senator Margetts on the phone last night that it was the minister's intention to table the documents yesterday. That was his honest intention. I did not have to make that concession, but I did so in the cause of openness and honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister came in this morning at the earliest possible occasion, within a minute of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4083"> the Senate sitting, and explained the situation  to the Senate. It was a reasonable explanation making it quite clear that it is our intention to table the documents and that we will do so in a way that is responsible and within all of the protocols that have been laid down by this government and by previous governments in relation to tabling documents and responding to returns to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, in opening this debate on the suspension of standing orders, said we had more than a week's notice and not six hours notice as Senator Hill claimed. The reality is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and the records of the Senate will show that indeed notice of a motion was given. But I could give a notice of a motion today for some action in two weeks time, when the Senate sits again, but it would be extremely presumptive of me to predict what the Senate's mind would be in relation to that motion. If Senator Margetts thinks that Senator Hill should have to prejudge what the Australian Democrats in particular, the Labor Party, Senator Harradine, Senator Colston or even Senator Brown would do in relation to one of her motions relating to returns to order, then I think she is being naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that that motion was passed late on Monday afternoon and the return time was that evening&mdash;a matter of six hours or fewer to comply. As Senator Hill said, departmental staff in the relevant departments&mdash;and I presume that is Environment Australia and others&mdash;worked through to 3 o'clock at least one morning and until a late hour on other days to comply with the Senate's order. The minister has said he will comply with the Senate's order, and his intention is to do so in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the Senate that we dispense with what can only be described as a ploy and a stunt to show off in front of the non-government environmental organisations while they are here in Canberra meeting with the minister today and get on with the Senate's business as quickly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(9.42 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I did not understand Senator Hill's explanation earlier this morning because, as I understand it, Senator Margetts's
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return to order goes to documents held by Environment Australia, including the Australian Heritage Commission. I do not precisely understand why such documents would be owned by Minister Anderson. This is something about which I would be interested to hear a response from the government. I suspect the whole of the government's environment policy is owned by Minister Anderson, and that is probably the only logical explanation one can come to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to be clear here that what Senator Margetts is saying in relation to a notice of motion for a return to order does have, I think, some strength. I certainly recall many occasions when such notice was given during the time of the previous Labor government and the then opposition arguing very strenuously that the government should act on the assumption that the notice of motion would be agreed to by the Senate. There are numerous examples of then opposition shadow ministers arguing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is strength in Senator Margetts's case in relation to the timing and notice being given on 14 May. I would like to quote what Senator Hill said in relation to this matter in the Senate on 27 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by my officials that the documents should be ready for tabling in the Senate tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that it is now 30 May, it would not be unreasonable for Senator Margetts to have an expectation that the minister would be able to comply with the return to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that there is a fair dose of hypocrisy and inconsistency in what the government says. I am reminded of a speech Senator Hill made on 20 May 1993 in relation to a return to order in the area of responsibility of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Bob Collins. These are Senator Hill's words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was not at all happy with that . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This related to Senator Bolkus, in fact. Senator Hill spoke about a tendering process return to order when Senator Bolkus was administrative services minister. He said about Senator Bolkus:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4084">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was not at all happy with that; nevertheless, he accepted his obligation to comply with the order of the Senate, as all ministers should be prepared to  if we are going to have a decent system of accountability within our democratic structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Campbell said, in relation to the Casselden Place return to order&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CAMPBELL" NAMEID="H15">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the trouble, Senator; you have to be consistent in this place. Senator Campbell said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the minister has breached an order of the Senate. That is a serious offence. The Senate considered the points I put to it last week and made the decision to order the minister to table documents. The minister has breached that without any apology or explanation . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Senate loses its power to compel the executive to table these sorts of documents then we may as well go home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is some strength in what Senator Margetts says. But there is also strength in a case that the government did not make but should have made&mdash;that this is a day that ought to be dedicated to government business. I think the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) should have made that point and tried to make it persuasively. He did not. But I know that the Senate agreed to sit on three consecutive sitting Fridays to deal with the government's legislation program in lieu of extra sitting weeks that had been floated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to deal with government business today. It is important also to have this minister accountable. For those reasons, on balance, the opposition will not support urgency today. But we do acknowledge the strength of the arguments and the case that I have put and I think that Senator Margetts has put. There will be an insistence&mdash;</PARA>

If he does not, I can assure Senator Margetts that I will consider that as a very strong case for censure of the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in this circumstance, given the commitments that have been given in this place in relation to the necessity to deal with a raft of government business, when the opposition gives its commitment it will deal with government business on an extra sitting day it will honour it. I want to see Senator Hill honour his obligations as well. It is for those reasons, Madam President, that we will not agree to urgency&mdash;though accepting, as I think you have heard in the contribution I have made, the strength of some of the arguments that Senator Margetts has presented to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think Senator Brown should have his attention drawn to the fact that the Senate is not considering a motion of censure at the moment; we are actually considering a motion to suspend standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct, Senator Brown. You should be addressing the question of urgency at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and I am. But the outcome of that, if that is adopted by the Senate, will be the censure of the Minister for the Environment, who deserves censuring, despite the protection that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) tries to give him. He deserves censuring because this matter is urgent and he has taken the usual lackadaisical, swivel in the chair and leave the Senate for most of the debate attitude which marks his ministership of the environment portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Margetts is trying to do here is to get the minister to produce for public
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4085"> perusal the evidence upon which he said, `I license, in my key position as Minister for the  Environment, the chainsaws and the bulldozers to move in on the statuesque forests of the Giblett block in south-west Western Australia'&mdash;these grand forests where there are citizens peacefully protesting, trying to prevent the destruction of a key part of the National Estate in this country. But the Minister for the Environment is saying, `Destroy it.' That is a remarkable set of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts has said, `Produce the evidence upon which you overruled the 1994 advice from the Australian Heritage Commission to government that this block, above all in that part of the forest, should be protected.' This is the creme de la creme of these grand forests, of this ecosystem, in this region near Pemberton in Western Australia. The Australian Heritage Commission has said, `Of all these pieces in this little region, protect this bit.' But the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, and his cohorts have said, `No, that's where you should send the bulldozers. That's where the woodchippers should be directed. We endorse that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts says, `Produce the advice upon which you, as Minister for the Environment, have made this despicable decision to destroy these forests.' No wonder Senator Hill is ducking for cover. As Senator Margetts said, he had advice that this request was being made two weeks ago. This morning he is saying, `I'm not going to produce it. I'll put it off for at least another two weeks because the Senate will not be sitting until Monday fortnight.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister says that he did not say that at all. I am acute enough to listen to what you have to say, Senator Hill. It has very rarely got any degree of substance in it, and never as far as the environment is concerned. But on this occasion you said that you will produce the documents when you are ready. You put no condition on it. Anyway, if you had, I would have believed you as much today as I would have believed you on Tuesday, when you said that your
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advice is that these documents will be ready for tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can be brought out yelling and waving your arms now, but it is not going to get you out of the dock where Senator Margetts has put you. And that is where you should be, because your actions are reprehensible and you deserve censure. This is an urgent matter because there are people sitting in the forests in Western Australia trying to do the job you are failing to do for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are saying that you have not said when you are going to produce these documents, you can say so now. When will you produce the documents? What you have said to this Senate is that it is not you but the minister for logging, Mr Anderson, in the House of Representatives who is calling the shots here. You have abrogated your responsibility to the environment, to the forests of this nation, to the minister for destroying the forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all right for you to swivel in your chair and turn your back on me; you have to as you do not have an answer to that. If you were in here in defence of the environment you would be producing these documents and turning your back on Mr Anderson instead. But you are a cohort of the chainsaws, you are fuel to the bulldozers, and you are an agent of destruction when you should be an agent of protection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point is that there has been a leniency from the chair in recent years because of the change to the Senate standing orders in relation to suspension of standing orders. The debate has been limited, as you know, to five minutes a speaker and to half an hour for the total debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a judgment for you, and it is up to you, Madam President. I do not make an intervention in relation to whether Senator Brown has been unparliamentary, but I do make an intervention in relation to the nature of the contribution and its relevance to urgency, and I ask you to take my comments into account as you rule on that aspect of Senator Campbell's point of order.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WINE EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce a charge on exports of Australian wine to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (the corporation). The government is introducing the charge at the request of the wine industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation's statutory responsibilities include wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation is currently funded by levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979. In recent years it has also received financial support for export promotion through grants from state and Commonwealth governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine industry developed the export charge proposal because it was concerned that the corporation would have to wind down its generic export promotion program for Australian wine as the grant funding came to an end. The industry strongly supports the corporation's export promotion program, and regards it as an essential component of its export growth strategy. It does not believe that a voluntary scheme would be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of the wine export charge will ensure continued funding for generic wine export promotion. The export charge is expected to raise about $1 million per year to fund the infrastructure and part of the promotion program costs of the Australian Wine Export Council (the council). Exporters participating in major promotions also contribute directly to meet part of the cost. The council, a committee of the corporation, oversees the corporation's export promotion program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine export charge will have no impact on the Commonwealth budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine industry has demonstrated its support for the export charge proposal in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At successive annual general meetings of the corporation, in 1995 and 1996, levy payers to the corporation have considered motions in support of the wine export charge. All levy payers are entitled to vote at the annual general meeting, with votes allocated according to the dollar amount of levy paid. The motion was circulated to all
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4088"> levy payers  prior to the meetings. At the last meeting in December 1996, 94 per cent of votes were in favour of the proposal. There was strong support for the proposal from small, medium and large producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also received many representations from individual winemakers and industry bodies, including the corporation, requesting the introduction of the charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On taking office, the government had to consider a number of proposals from primary industries for new levies and charges. It decided that a more systematic process was needed for assessing such proposals, and decided to develop a set of principles for the purposes of this assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the levies principles, the government was concerned to ensure that there was a strong case and a high level of support for proposals from industry for new levies and charges. It wanted to be satisfied on a number of points, including that such proposals relate to a function for which there is a significant market failure, have broad support within the industry, and have been the subject of extensive consultation with all industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has assessed the wine export charge against the levies principles and is satisfied that it meets all relevant principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators are aware, the Australian wine industry is currently enjoying unprecedented international recognition and is achieving rapid growth in exports. Between 1985/86 and 1995/96, exports grew more than ten&hyphen;fold in volume and more than twenty&hyphen;fold in value, from 11 million litres worth $21 million to 130 million litres worth $471 million. Australia's major export markets are Europe, North America and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In calendar year 1996, exports totalled 148 million litres valued at $551 million. This is an increase on the previous year of 28 per cent by volume and 36 per cent by value. Exports now account for over 28 per cent of production. This growth in exports is being accomplished in spite of falling world production and consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has projected that by 2001/02, wine exports will more than double in volume to 407 million litres valued at $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to $1.3 billion in 1996/97 dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian wine industry has set a goal in its industry plan entitled `Strategy 2025' to achieve annual sales of $4.5 billion by the year 2025 of which exports would make up $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry believes that generic promotion of Australian wine in export markets will continue to make an important contribution to the achievement of its goals, and is prepared to fund this promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine industry has developed an exciting vision for its long&hyphen;term future in `Strategy 2025'. Through its support for the wine export charge, the industry has demonstrated it is committed to future growth and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development through exports. The government wishes the industry every success in this important endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators, and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WINE EXPORT CHARGE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 (the Corporation Act) and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 (the Collection Act). These amendments are required as a result of the enactment of the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation Act is amended in several ways: firstly, to include payers of the wine export charge in the arrangements for the Corporation's annual general meeting. This will enable them to have the right to represent their interests at annual general meetings of the Corporation and to receive the services and information that the Corporation provides to its levy payers. Secondly, to include wine export charge funds in the arrangements for payments between the Commonwealth and the Corporation; and finally to extend to the wine export charge the arrangements which enable the Corporation to provide information in order to assist and make savings in the levy collection process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Collection Act is amended so that the arrangements under that act for the collection of levies and charges are extended to the wine export charge, to enable it to be collected in an efficient and effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators, and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWINGS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Infrastructure Borrowing tax concession was first introduced by the previous government as part of their 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation </EMPHASIS> statement. It was extended in the 1994 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation </EMPHASIS> statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of the infrastructure borrowings tax concession was to allow companies reduced costs of borrowing to finance the construction of infrastructure projects. This was achieved by the borrower forgoing deductions for the cost of the borrowing, such as interest, and the lender being exempt from tax in respect of gains from borrowing, such as corresponding interest income, or eligible for a tax rebate of 36 per cent. The intention was for lenders to pass these benefits back to the project via a lower interest rate on the borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be eligible to use the infrastructure borrowing tax concession, an infrastructure project must be certified by the Development Allowance Authority. In the period between 1994 and 30 June 1996, the Development Allowance Authority issued certificates for 12 infrastructure borrowing projects with a total borrowing of $4 billion. At 30 June 1996, it also had six applications on hand with total borrowings of at least $2.6 billion. Over
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4089"> the six weeks prior to the 1996-97 budget, the Development Allowance Authority received applications for a further 71 projects with estimated borrowings of around $21.6 billion. If all these applications were certified, the revenue cost over the period 1996-97 to 1998-99 has been estimated to exceed $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of tax aggressive financing arrangements intended to be implemented in association with some of these applications, much of the revenue lost would be captured by financiers and high marginal tax rate investors rather than the intended recipients, the infrastructure projects themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against that background, the Treasurer announced on 14 February 1997 the cessation of the infrastructure borrowing tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 that are necessary to wind up the concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill prevents the Development Allowance Authority from issuing any certificates to infrastructure projects after 12.00pm on 14 February 1997. However, where an infrastructure project had received, prior to that time, advice from the Development Allowance Authority that it would be issued with a certificate subject to specified undertakings, the Development Allowance Authority will be permitted to issue a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law, conditions on existing certificates can be varied. However, a variation after 12.00pm on 14 February 1997 will not be permitted where the Commissioner of Taxation determines that the variation is likely to cause an increased cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not otherwise affect already issued certificates continuing and operating unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable Senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Reform of Employment Services Bill 1996 [1997] and the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1996 [1997] repeal in full the Employment Services Act 1994, which enacted the Labor Party's Working Nation approach&mdash;the provision of labour market programs and case management&mdash;for the long&hyphen;term unemployed. These bills represent a very radical change in direction for employment services in Australia. The changes have been shrouded in positive rhetoric. However, these bills and the minister's second reading speech are totally silent on many important issues. It is only through analysis of the omissions to this proposed legislation that we learn what it is really about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has serious concerns about the government's new direction for employment services in Australia. We are not opposed to the introduction of further competition into employment services. Labor, under its Working Nation program, introduced competition to employment services, and that proved successful in the provision of case management. Labor did that while strengthening the role of the public provider in ensuring fundamental community service obligations were delivered for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than take a further measured step along the road to increased competition in the provision of employment services, this government has elected to radically overthrow the current arrangements in a most imprudent way. These bills are allegedly about creating a market for employment assistance services. Their impact, however, is far wider and far more fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills, if enacted unamended, would remove the commitment to seek full employ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4090"> ment, end universal access to free labour exchange services, abolish the legislative guarantee of a public provider of employment services, exclude approximately one&hyphen;third of job seekers from anything but self&hyphen;help facilities, omit any legislative guarantee to meet employment services needs in rural and regional areas, distribute $1 billion of public funds to private providers operating in a new market without adequate safeguards, fail to guarantee quality of services or rights of access for job seekers&mdash;in a regime that militates against training and secure long&hyphen;term job placements&mdash;and create a market where all job seekers who are not publicly subsidised will end up having to pay for employment services. All this comes in a budget context of reduced funding and rationing of limited services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would have us believe that allocating fewer funds to a new, untested market for distributing assistance to a rationed number of unemployed persons represents a serious assault on the country's unemployment problem. Labor believes that there is nothing in these bills that can be represented as a fundamental attack on the nation's continuing high unemployment problem. To the contrary, they are likely to create significant barriers to employment for some job seekers, provide cost barriers to employers seeking labour and lead to inefficiency in the operation of the labour market. These bills represent one of the largest and most imprudent privatisations of government services in Australian history. There is no mandate for this legislation. It is yet another example of the government's determination to quietly introduce its 1993 Fightback agenda, hoping that no&hyphen;one notices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most notably, these bills are further evidence of the government's equivocation on unemployment. National unemployment remains at around the 8.7 per cent level. The decline in the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;experienced under Labor's programs&mdash;has ceased. Long&hyphen;term unemployment is beginning to rise again. The government's 1996 budget reduced employment assistance, with $1.8 billion cut from labour market programs designed to help the unemployed.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The 1997 budget further rations assistance. The government has repeatedly refused to set any target for reducing unemployment in this country. Now it quietly seeks to remove the legislative objective of full employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act states as its aim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to promote full employment by providing employment services that are free of charge to job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nowhere in this coalition government's bill will you find that or any other commitment to full employment. This is not a drafting oversight. It is a deliberate omission. Full employment is not an objective of this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are asked to trust the minister on much of the detail of the scheme, the consequences of failure will cost Australia dearly. Re&hyphen;establishing the infrastructure of employment services abolished by this bill will be a mammoth and costly task. In the meantime, who will salvage the lives of the long&hyphen;term unemployed, abandoned by virtue of these decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will be proposing amendments to these bills that, if passed, will establish a model of employment service provision different in a number of fundamental respects from that proposed by the government. The opposition believes that, if a market for employment assistance is to be created, the parliament must ensure that the rights of the unemployed to access services and assistance are properly protected. The government cannot walk away from the provision of basic employment services to those in need. Maintenance of this essential service is in the community's interest. Under the Labor model, existing public services will be maintained alongside the competitive model proposed for more intensive employment assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments in no way interfere with the government's intention to establish a competitive market for employment assist ance, despite our serious reservations about the focus and priorities that will create. The government has not sought nor received a mandate to abolish free universal access to employment exchange services. They have not established the case for abandoning that most basic of community service obligations. It is a sad indictment of the government that it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4091"> simultaneously seeks to make access to a tax break universal while denying unemployed persons access to employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of a guarantee that labour exchange services will be provided free of charge to all job seekers is the major omission in these bills. Labor believes that universal access to labour exchange services is fundamental to a society purporting to provide equality of opportunity to all of its citizens. Since 1946 the Commonwealth Employment Service has provided a free service to fill vacancies and assist all Australians seeking employment. The CES has been the embodiment of Australia's obligation under ILO Convention No. 88, article 1, which requires the maintenance of a free public employment service. This provision of basic labour exchange services by the CES has ensured a national employment market accessible to all, regardless of their locality or personal wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Facilitating free access by employers to people seeking employment and free access to available vacancies by job seekers forms part of the government's basic community obligations. What the government is in fact doing is attempting to introduce a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service regime for employment exchange services in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do this in part by limiting those who in future will be eligible to access free labour exchange services. Approximately 400,000 job seekers currently registered with the CES will no longer be able to access free, publicly funded labour exchange services. Eligible job seekers&mdash;which is the minister's new phrase&mdash;will be limited by ministerial directive to recipients of unemployment allowances or other forms of income support, young people aged 15 to 20 not in receipt of income support and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants in CDEP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those new restrictions will impact most heavily on women with working spouses, on newly arrived migrants, on part-time workers seeking full-time work, on people wishing to change jobs and, of course, on those recently retrenched. These people will be forced to make their own arrangements in a new market
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where EPEs will be paid a fee for placing publicly subsidised clients into vacancies. Clearly, for a non&hyphen;subsidised client to be considered for a vacancy by a profit driven EPE, they will need to pay a matching or greater fee. Otherwise there would be no incentive for the EPE to refer the non-subsidised client to an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposal to permit closed vacancies effectively allows the EPE to own a job vacancy. Commercial realities dictate that EPEs will seek to maintain control of their vacancies and fill them with their own subsidised clients, or those prepared and able to pay a similar or better fee. The government's new labour exchange services market will require non-subsidised clients, currently one&hyphen;third of people registered as seeking work, to pay a minimum fee of $250 to a private service provider for the right to simply access job vacancies. Instead of accessing free labour exchange services, those job seekers will have to pay an up-front fee to access the services of an EPE, and in this regime EPEs will effectively control job vacancies and referrals to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill effectively erects new barriers for unemployed people in their effort to gain employment. Employers too will be forced for the first time to pay for job screening and job matching services currently performed free by the CES. Businesses will be slugged with this extra cost even if they are seeking seasonal or casual workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a risk that segmentation of the labour market will take place through EPEs hoarding vacancies in specialist regional or industry markets. It is likely that EPEs will specialise in particular industries, regions and occupations. If an EPE specialises in a particular industry and a job seeker wishes to enter another industry, there may be no other local EPE with appropriate skills and vacancies. These inefficiencies in the government's  model encourage labour market segmentation and immobility between occupations, industries and regions. The difficulties accessing jobs between these segmented labour markets will work against efficiency and increase unemployment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4092">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural and regional Australia is likely to suffer further disadvantage as a result of these proposals. The opposition is particularly concerned at the inadequacy of the government's explanation as to how its model will service regions that cannot support a competitive market. Even the government does not deny that higher costs required to deliver services and the absence of employment prospects may mean that some regions cannot be regarded as viable for outcomes based funding. Ministerial reassurances that the PEPE may be directed as a last resort to fill the gaps provide little comfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doubts about the provision of services to rural and regional Australia are reinforced by the government itself in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Employment: Questions and Answers</EMPHASIS> booklet. The booklet poses this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the new arrangements meet the needs of rural and regional Australia for employment services?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The answer is illuminating. This is the answer by the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not address the issue of distribution of employment services across Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly! That, Senators, is but one of the fundamental flaws in this proposal. It is, however, the only one that the government has had the courage to acknowledge. Unemployed people in rural and regional Australia should receive access to publicly funded, high quality employment services as of right. If anything, extra resources should be directed to address their additional disadvantage. The government's model fails to address those needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all these reasons the opposition will be moving amendments, with the Democrats, guaranteeing that all job seekers have a right to free and universal labour exchange services. These amendments are essential to ensure that the basic community service obligations of the government are not abrogated and that inequalities experienced by unemployed people are not exacerbated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further major omission in the legislation is the failure of the government to establish the functions and role of the PEPE within the bill. Despite earlier assurances by the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister, the legislation does not even contain a reference to the public provider. The only reference to the involvement of a PEPE is in the revised ministerial statement, to the effect that a public corporation will be established. We are naturally suspicious that, in establishing the legislative framework for the supposedly competitively neutral market, the government makes no mention at all of the role of the public provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving amendments to establish the PEPE and allocate it appropriate functions. The amendments establish the PEPE as a statutory authority&mdash;a far more appropriate vehicle for the provision of community service obligations than the company proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without these amendments, the parliament will effectively remove any obligation on the government to provide services to the unemployed. To place total faith in the as yet untested private market is, in my view, irresponsible. The market is totally funded by public money. A public provider can provide stability and act as a benchmark for best practice in the new market. In moving to this more competitive market, in what even the government describes as a radical move, the community is entitled to the protection of an ongoing statutory public provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also has concerns that the nature of the corporation means that the role of the public provider could be downgraded, or even abolished, without reference to parliament. To leave any commitment to services for the unemployed to the vagaries of the success or failure of a private corporation in the marketplace would be a total abrogation of our responsibilities as members of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals fail the test of prudence. By enshrining PEPE and its role and function within the legislation, the parliament will safeguard access to employment services to people in rural Australia and other  areas which may not be serviced by private providers. It will also assist to reduce the problems of market segmentation inherent in the government's proposal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4093">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's assertion that our ILO and community service obligations are met by the most rudimentary facilities to be provided at the Commonwealth services delivery agency is unsustainable and, quite frankly, insulting. There is clearly a role for the experience, skills and talents of the former CES staff to be used in providing services to the unemployed. They are best placed to offer employment assistance. We are extremely concerned at reports of ministerial pressure to limit the size of the market that the PEPE can gain. The ideological pursuits of this government should not lay to waste the public investment in those services. The legislation must ensure that investment and resources are retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that the first and only certain impact of these government `reforms' is the loss of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs in the public sector. The amendments we will move, if successful, may help reduce that unfortunate, self-defeating impact. Consistent with our position on the agency bill, the opposition will be supporting the maintenance of public service terms and conditions for those employees moving to the PEPE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been impressed by the range of concerns of community groups and providers about how the market will operate in practice and whether or not it will deliver the quality of service, the equity and the value for money the government claims. The bill purports to establish a competitively neutral market for the allocation of public funding of services to selected unemployed persons, but even the government concedes that the market is a new one and will contain many imperfections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fixed price tender system will be used initially with competitive price tendering in future rounds. Profit making, not for profit organisations and the PEPE will allegedly compete on equal terms in that market. It is not at all clear to the opposition as to how this is all to be achieved but, again, we are simply required to trust the government and leave the detail to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that the strength of these proposals is in their shift from a focus on processes to one more directed at outcomes. The present system can benefit from a greater emphasis on individual needs, but this proposal goes too far. It focuses solely on easily measured outcomes achieved by whatever means. The pressure will be on the providers to meet outcomes rather than on the quality of an outcome. The problems of the labour market, the unemployed and the long-term unemployed are far more complex than that. They are people, not commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those with experience in this field fear the emergence of a range of different problems. They question whether the profit motive will interfere with the provision of the best possible services to the unemployed. They question whether the process will encourage providers to deal with the least disadvantaged clients at the cost of those most in need. They question whether the focus on placement outcomes will militate against the provision of training and support to ensure sustained employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that optimal outcomes for the job seeker are most likely where the interests of the job seeker are paramount. With no higher interest than the profit available, it is highly likely that outcomes will be characterised by less secure, lower quality, lower skilled employment. Quality of outcome&mdash;that is, long-term, sustainable employment&mdash;is no longer an objective. The government's proposal, in our view, shifts the balance too far to an outcome based approach. The opposition has a range of concerns regarding the regime controlling EPEs. As with so many issues arising from this bill, the lack of detail is a concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over $1 billion of public funds are to be placed at the disposal of private providers. The community and the parliament must be satisfied that these funds are expended in an accountable manner effectively and that they provide value for money. The parliament must ensure that EPEs provide appropriate services of a high quality to job seekers. We must ensure that these clients receive the absolutely  highest standard of service possible in the new market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking to ensure that sufficient accountability measures are put in place to protect the massive public investment in EPEs and the service they provide to clients. The opposition will also be seeking assurances from the minister that the standards of privacy, rights to freedom of information, appeal rights, et cetera, are not diminished in any way by virtue of the privatisation of employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Labor Party cannot support the bill in its current form. So much of the government's proposed model for employment services is a reflection of conservative ideology rather than of sound public policy. That ideology is sought to be implemented with minimal community debate and pursued without community support and without minimal prudent safeguards of the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exclusion of 400,000 Australians from access to basic public labour exchange services is a repudiation of our ILO commitments and a betrayal of those who are the most vulnerable in our society. It is a callous and discriminatory measure. The government has offered no adequate explanation for its failure to establish the public employment service provider in the legislation. One can only conclude that it is not committed to the provision of public employment services in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes contained in the move to a competitive market for employment assistance are sufficient to make even the most foolhardy cautious. To adopt these measures without the safeguards proposed by Labor and the Democrats would be a disgraceful abrogation of a basic tenet of civilised societies. It is incredible that such a measure is being proposed at a time of persistent high unemployment. The government has completely failed to establish the case for removing and reducing services to the unemployed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unemployment is the most serious issue facing our nation. These bills that we are considering today, in conjunction with the previously considered Commonwealth Ser
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vices Delivery Agency Bill, set up the statutory framework for the implementation of the reforms to employment services which this government outlined in its budget last year. So this is part of this government's response to unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes which these bills facilitate are the most far-reaching changes to employment placement services since the CES was established in 1946. The abolition of the CES and the establishment of a new competitively neutral&mdash;and I wish that we had a way for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to record that when I say `competitively neutral', I mean it to be in inverted commas&mdash;labour market placement service will effectively take Australia from a system where the government has played an active role in the provision of employment services to one where it will take a hands&hyphen;off approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say I wish I could always acknowledge the quotation marks, because I do not accept the way the government uses this jargon. So I am going to ask that when I use, `in the name of competition policy', `in the name of privatisation', `in the name of rationing of funds', and `in the name of corporatisation, we are making these changes', those terms be taken as being in inverted commas. These are the jargon and the cornerstones of the economic rationalist approach which has dominated economic debate in this country for well over a decade now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the new `competitive environment' public employment agencies&mdash;or PEPEs&mdash;will compete with private employment agencies&mdash;or EPEs&mdash;for employment vacancies and for job seekers. Payment for EPEs and PEPEs will be primarily on an outcomes basis. In other words, I agree with the comments that this puts process onto a more important level than people, the receivers of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) says that these bills are just an extension of Labor's Working Nation program, this model is without precedent in the Western world and it will take Australia further towards free market employment  assistance and job placement services than any country has ever gone before.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4095">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to be very clear about this. This makes these reforms a huge social experiment which may or may not produce positive results. That is why we have been spending a lot of time seeking adequate safeguards, including a strong public provider. We believe that there is still an important role for government in employment service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make one point clear: the Democrats are not afraid of change; we are not afraid of radical change. But we do believe that the most likely effects of change need to be considered and understood very clearly before they are passed into law. That is why we believe it is important to fill in the nitty&hyphen;gritty details of how this will work out there in the real world before asking parliament to give it the big tick, as is often the case here, because hundreds of thousands of Australians stand to be affected by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of problems with this legislation. We have a number of concerns about the nature of the broader changes which are being proposed. We are concerned at the lack of detail which these bills contain, particularly on the corporatised public provider. As is the case with many other incredibly important and contentious pieces of legislation, I am certain that many Australians who will be affected by this do not yet realise the magnitude of these changes. I am also sure that many Australians currently using the services of the CES do not yet realise that their access to many of the services they have been accustomed to is about to be curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, while all Australians will still have access to self&hyphen;help facilities at the new one&hyphen;stop shop, the really important qualifier is that only those who are in receipt of unemployment benefits or other forms of qualifying government support&mdash;such as young people aged 15 to 20 years who are registered as unemployed with a CSDA and not in full&hyphen;time education; Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander participants in community development employment projects; or people who are placed in an entry level training vacancy&mdash;will still have access to additional forms of employment assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, people who have working partners, part&hyphen;time workers looking for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more work, workers looking for alternative employment, school and university students looking for part&hyphen;time work, and anyone looking for work but not claiming DSS allowances will not be really be able to access these additional services. Surely, at a time of the increasing casualisation of the work force when so many Australians are forced to work fewer hours&mdash;not by choice but because that is all the work they can find&mdash;and surely when they have a right to find more work, they should not be denied access to the assistance to make this possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very interested to hear the minister explain how the government thinks people who are no longer eligible for assistance will find a job once these changes are enforced. I know that she says that the EPEs are going to have this pool of other people there because it makes sense to them to be able to say to people seeking to use them, `Oh, we've got a huge number of people on our books.' I would like her to convince us that that is really the way it is going to happen and why that gives people sufficient protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also be very interested to hear exactly what effect the government thinks this set of changes will have on the participation rate of women and on part&hyphen;time workers. The Democrats believe that everyone should continue to have access to free labour exchange services. We too want to ensure that Australians living in rural and remote areas continue to have access to a similar range of services to those of their urban counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of detail which surrounds the way the EPEs will operate and the services they will provide is also a matter about which we are deeply concerned. Precisely who will be able to apply to become an EPE? What services will these organisations provide? How will they be accredited? We look forward to hearing the detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Democrats acknowledge that the government has now supplied some of the details regarding the way EPEs will operate in its exposure draft on tenders, there are still many aspects surrounding the operations of EPEs that we are concerned about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4096">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major issues is how these organisations will be accredited. I just think that this is too important to take the details on trust. We did not do that with a Labor government and we do not think it is right to do it with a coalition government. It is not good enough to come and fill in the really important detail afterwards. Unless there is a rigorous system of accreditation, monitoring and evaluation, there will be too much room for unscrupulous EPEs to rort the system and exploit unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One witness to the committee hearing on this bill suggested that the process of determining how to rort the system is already well under way, with a:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . burgeoning industry out there in terms of people coming up with all sorts of possible scams they could operate with a view to doing these sorts of things. The sorts of things that are being bandied around include under&hyphen;the&hyphen;table payments to personnel officers in companies to get them to agree to take your person rather than over the table. Others include trading in cases of wine and all sorts of other things.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ACOSS has already seen this happen. There also seems to be a great deal of scope for fly&hyphen;by&hyphen;night shonks to set up as EPEs for no other reason than to feather their own nests. It is a good little business opportunity for a short time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we can see, there is nothing in this legislation to prevent unscrupulous operators from registering as EPEs&mdash;it might be possible to meet the accreditation standards and still be totally unscrupulous&mdash;signing up a number of job seekers in order to get the first outcome payments and then promptly going out of business. Other possibilities which have been raised include EPEs paying corporations to give them job vacancies, EPEs minimising the level of training they offer and EPEs `creaming' off the job seekers most likely to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So under these bills we are being asked to implement, the EPEs will have a great deal of power, yet we have no assurance they are going to deliver real employment outcomes. If these new EPEs do fail to deliver, the result will be that some of the most vulnerable members of our society will be in a worse
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation than they are now because there will be nowhere left to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can expect the minister to say that the CES has not been performing and we can expect her to point out its outcomes compared with some private agencies, but at least there is a CES to go to for those who have no other options. Do you think Drake wants to deal with the kinds of people who go to the CES as a last resort?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no CES to pick up the pieces because the CES, once it becomes the new PEPE, will be significantly pared back in terms of its staff and its services to make it more `competitive', as the jargon goes. So there is a lot riding on the success or failure of the measures we are considering today. I do not think it is possible to overemphasise the importance of monitoring, evaluating and even adjusting some of these reforms along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that DEETYA is the appropriate body to carry out this monitoring and evaluation. While we recognise that DEETYA will be the purchaser as opposed to the provider of employment services, we think there will still be some conflict of interest with DEETYA carrying out these additional tasks. We think an independent watchdog council established along the lines of a reformed ESRA would be in a much better position to carry out the oversight and evaluation of employment placement services and these reforms generally. We intend to move an amendment to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other more controversial aspects of these reforms is that labour market assistance will be restricted to people the department feels will benefit most from assistance and that assistance will be rationed to 12 months. So many concerns have been raised about this that I could not summarise them all in the time left today, but I will put on the record some of the main areas of concern. They are the lack of assistance which will be available to job seekers once they have completed their 12 months intensive employment assistance, the impact this restriction may have on people with disabilities and the possibility that job seekers who are not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4097"> eligible for additional employment assistance will end up on some kind of job scrap heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government has said that the answer to this is the community support programs to help those people who are deemed not to be eligible for the 12 months of intensive assistance, again this is taken on trust. We have heard too few details about how these programs will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats support community support programs which assist unemployed people with literacy and numeracy problems, with drug and alcohol rehabilitation and with personal counselling and housing placement, but we do not support the kind of either/or approach this government has adopted on this particular issue. We think community support programs should be available to all job seekers in addition to other forms of employment assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is widespread concern among those experienced in working with unemployed people that EPEs will `cream off' job seekers who will be easiest to place and neglect those who pose more of a challenge. I think it is important to note that some of the bigger EPEs would be able to earn quite a decent income just by collecting first outcome payments for job seekers who register with them and collecting second outcome payments for those job seekers they can easily place in work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these concerns that have been raised by Senator Chris Evans and me are as yet unproven one way or the other. But in trying to understand how these changes can work, we have spoken to those who have the experience of working with unemployed people and they share our concern about the lack of detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are, yet again, about ideology&mdash;the obsession with all things private, the belief that private is always better than public and the belief that, whatever you do, you do not do anything that would give public providers any more resources than the competing private providers. I do not deny that private delivery of some services is better, and it may even be better in this particular area. As I say, this is a big social experiment. We do not know what will happen and that is why we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must insist on a proper monitoring and evaluation process. We will be moving&mdash;</PARA>

Here we are today handing across to a profit&hyphen;seeking sector of the community a government obligation to provide not just employment services but also skilling services for those people who are unemployed in this country.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4099"> they cannot create those jobs. And what they do know is that in this parliament at the moment there is a process of removing the obligation from the government to a private sector which it not going to want to deal with them&mdash;they are too hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to make profit out of replacing people, if you get rewarded for placing people in jobs, the last people you want on your books are those 151,000. At the very least, at the end of the day those people are going to be languishing as a result of this profit out of the unemployed alternative that the government has come up with, which, as I said earlier, even Maggie Thatcher did not think up. I want to mention the 10,000 on the compulsory work for the dole scheme, because I will be moving an amendment to this legislation to make sure that that program is uncoupled from this privatisation process that the legislation before us deals with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We totally oppose compulsory work for the dole. It is ultimately a vindictive way of dealing, not only with those young people who are least able to get a job and have for the longest period of time had to deal with the disheartenment and disillusionment of not getting a job, but it is going to selectively pick regional areas of Australia&mdash;the pockets of highest unemployment. People there will be faced with this compulsion to work without any necessity for reskilling for a period of time for below award wages and without the conditions that they would get if they were working in a proper job rather than forced work for the dole. Moreover, through no fault of their own these people are going to ultimately end up displacing people who would be getting proper wages and conditions. If you look at the situation in New York City, there are some 26,000 people street cleaning and fixing up parks and gardens on pitiable wages through compulsory work for the dole schemes replacing people who used to get proper wages and conditions in those very jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the spin&hyphen;off of a compulsory work for the dole program that is creeping into this government's economic fundamentalist program of punishment for those people who cannot get a job. It will end up not only
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affecting those people and further disillusioning them&mdash;because it is not going to skill them for a job that they want to get fulfilment out of further down the line&mdash;but it is also going to knock out of a properly waged and conditioned job people who would otherwise have been in full&hyphen;time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving an amendment to ensure that these privatised for profit employment agencies, who are now going to replace the Commonwealth Employment Service, are not simply able to get off their books the people they dislike and say, `We'll transfer you across to a compulsory work for the dole scheme, because that is in the interests of us making money.' If this government persists with that sort of compulsory scheme, let it be not an option for the profit drive of those organisations getting government moneys to place people in work. They will abuse it if the option is there, because it will be in their interests to place people who they find difficult to place in proper work onto this compulsory work for the dole scheme as a means of getting them off their books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There it is&mdash;a move to experiment in economic fundamentalism with the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in this country. It is social experimentation and it is ultimately going to abuse those people least able to defend themselves and who already feel bad enough about not having a job. It is putting a government responsibility in the hands of private enterprise and it is, when it comes down to it, about people making a profit out of the misery of people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to be dealing forever in this place with attempts to prevent the exploitation of this privatised employment service system. It is much better that it is kept as a public service, that it is kept as a government responsibility, because then we here are directly accountable for our obligation to the unemployed people of this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate to support these two bills before the chamber, the Reform of Employment Services Bill 1996 and the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with great interest to the contribution of Senator Brown. It is a great pity that people do not inform themselves better before they take part in these debates and understand the way in which this legislation is supposed to operate. It is also a pity that people are blinded by ideology before they see that things could possibly work better under a different scheme. I challenge Senator Brown to have a look at the outcomes at the CES and come into this chamber again after he has done that and try to justify why we should keep a system that is an abject failure. Its outcomes are getting worse, and that is demonstrably obvious. Why on earth would you keep it running in the same way, unless you are a blind ideologue on the matter? It is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4101"> long overdue for reform and that is what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two bills before the chamber are a key part of our reform to Labor market assistance in this country. These reforms actually rule off the past era, the failure of Labor's former so&hyphen;called Working Nation program. As chair of the Employment, Education and Training Committee in 1995, I had a very close look at this, along with the committee, as we carried out a major study on the outcomes and the reactions to the previous approach under Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was focused on long&hyphen;term unemployed. We did hear evidence from right around the country and we did find in regional areas up to 50 per cent youth unemployment after 13 years of Labor government. We found that long&hyphen;term unemployed would churn through these Working Nation programs with very poor real job outcomes at the end. We found that the vast majority of them, after six months of training, were back on the unemployment queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of one of these programs, new work opportunities, came in at $140,000 per person and it had less than 20 per cent job outcomes. We found that that program, along with many of the other Working Nation programs, was not working. An enormous amount of money was spent on these programs by the last government, but at the end of the day what happened is the vast majority of the people involved were back on the unemployment scrap heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons the coalition government was elected last year was to change this state because, after 13 years of Labor, there was actually no progress on the unemployment front. One of the things that we have done is move from the very inflexible approach that Labor had under that scheme, where it had a number of programs across Australia and the programs were pretty much the same everywhere, like it or lump it. We are now moving to a more flexible approach where the private sector will have real incentives to place people in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All services in the new employment assistance structure put in place by these bills will be based on a competitive tender process by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public and private agencies. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in her second reading speech, has outlined the nature of the EPE, the employment placement enterprise, and the PEPE, the private employment placement enterprise, structures. The EPEs will introduce a competitive tender process for private and community labour market placement providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brokers will be paid on outcomes and results&mdash;a point that seemed to be lost on Senator Brown, who said that the people who are difficult to place would be exploited. They were exploited under the Working Nation programs, where they ended up in a case management system and the ones who were really difficult to place were put at the back and lip-service was paid to their placement. The case managers checked on them every now and again, but there was not any great incentive for the case managers&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKAY" NAMEID="9L6">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator, we went round the country and talked to people on the ground. Look at our report. Look at the evidence, Senator, before you make statements like that and you will see that that is exactly what happened. Case managers reported to us that in the very large caseloads they had lip-service was paid to those people who were incredibly difficult to place. But under this system brokers will be paid more if they manage to place these people and they will get incentives as these people move through that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The PEPEs, the corporatised CES, will compete for training places in this new scheme on the same basis as private and community groups. The minister has outlined five categories of assistance and the number of places allocated to each in the first tender period following the passage of these bills. I am especially pleased that the entry level training for apprentices and traineeships will provide 200,000 places, many of these in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor the number of apprentices actually fell. In 1996 apprenticeships in Australia were running at 50,000 per year&mdash;the same as they were 12 years before. Even
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4102"> in 1988-89, during the boom, there were only 62,000 apprentices and then after that this number slipped markedly. It was a disgraceful performance by the previous government, and our promise to create 200,000 positions is far in advance of Labor's very meagre efforts during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own Hunter region the government has announced the establishment of a one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop to connect employers with prospective employees. This approach is being put in place in the Hunter as new skills are needed particularly in areas such as engineering as people move on from BHP, looking for new positions. BHP in Newcastle will continue to roll steel, so there is still a need for apprenticeships in the areas that take the product from BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, one of the other programs that we will be putting a great deal of emphasis on is the NEIS scheme, the new enterprise incentive scheme, which has an excellent record in terms of outcomes in moving unemployed people through to creating new businesses for themselves. The funding of 14,,000 places&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator, it was one of your initiatives&mdash;one of the ones that actually worked. Most of them failed. That is exactly what we are doing, Senator. Unlike what you were doing&mdash;letting them all run on; you let new work opportunities, which had failed outcomes, keep running&mdash;we are picking the best of what worked and holding onto that and then developing it further. NEIS works very well. Mind you, it took those opposite about 11 years to come up with it but, when that scheme did come into operation, it placed people extremely well&mdash;and we are going to push that a little further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister last week in my own area of Newcastle announced another 100 places, making 400 in the Hunter, in this scheme, which will assist people move on from BHP and establish new enterprises. BHP has actually identified a group of the 2,600 who are going who are interested in that sort of outcome. This program will be in place to assist those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provisions of this bill, community and private providers will vie in a competitive tender process, as will the whole corporatised CES. The competitive tender process is widely supported by the employment services sector, including private and community providers. We believe that competition will improve the delivery of services to the unemployed, unlike what Senator Brown said earlier. Also, it will improve real job outcomes for the unemployed, which, given the failed Working Nation program, is very much needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms to the structure of the labour market program are very timely and very constructive. The performance of the CES, something that Senator Brown indicated he wanted to keep, shows the real need to fix up what was a very ineffective approach to job placement. The record shows that the CES's performance has deteriorated very badly in the last 10 years. The share of Australian job vacancies filled by the CES declined significantly over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This major deterioration in performance occurred across all industry sectors. If you consider one of the measures of CES performance, you see that the CES's estimated share of all placements in both part-time and full-time employment fell from 31.8 per cent in 1986 to 16.7 per cent in 1992. Under Working Nation, at first CES activity rose to 19 per cent. But by 1996 it had declined again to 15.2 per cent, below the 1992 recession level and below the level of the start of Working Nation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has also analysed the erosion of the CES's market share of job placement. The percentage of people who reported that the CES had played some role in their finding a job fell from 9.7 per cent in 1985-86 to only 7.9 per cent 10 years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CES has been clearly in need of major reform, and you wonder why Senator Brown and others would want to keep hold of it in its current form. It has been finding fewer and fewer places for the unemployed and it is losing focus on servicing the needs of employers. The reforms contained in this bill will address the lack of placement performance by the CES. We want labour market
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4103"> assistance to have a clear focus and real job outcomes. We want it to make a difference to people's lives, particular those that are long-term unemployed, and we must alter the impression given by the witnesses to our long-term unemployment inquiry in 1995 that under Working Nation 70 per cent of people who were involved in its programs experienced the desolation of being pulled out of the gutter and after six months of training returning there. I commend to the Senate the major reforms of this bill that will change that situation and will deliver real and sustainable jobs to the unemployed of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The study which has been conducted by the department alleges that, if you compare the outcome rate for participants of the new work opportunities program with the outcome for unassisted unemployed who are allegedly from the same groupings in terms of length of unemployment, age, area, experience and the like, you come up with a marginal difference between the rate of success of participants in that program and that, when you apply that marginal difference to the actual cost, you can theoretically come up with a cost of $176,000, which I thought was the figure that Senator Tierney said. Certainly the figure that he used was a lot more than the actual cost. But the terminology that he used conveyed the impression to the public who are listening to this broadcast that the actual cost of the program per placement was many times the real cost that the Commonwealth has had to pay. I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will reveal that there has been a misleading of the Senate by Senator Tierney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that Senator Tierney touched on was the question of how the unemployed of Newcastle will be assisted by this legislation and, in particular, the people who lose their jobs when BHP makes its dramatic closure that has already been announced. The reality is, of course, that, if many of the people who lose their jobs receive some sort of redundancy payment or if they have a partner who is in employment and is ineligible for unemployment assistance, they will not be eligible for assistance to find employment under this legislation. So to claim to the people of Newcastle, which is the city that I understand Senator Tierney comes from, that this bill is in their interest is, I think, highly misleading. This bill will not assist the great majority of people who lose their jobs as a result of the closure of BHP's steel rolling mill in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of matters that I am tempted to touch upon, but I think I will go
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4104"> to what I think are the salient points of debate  in relation to the Reform of Employment Services Bill and the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill. These bills effectively complete the abolition of the Commonwealth Employment Service and puts in its place a privatised limited labour exchange service and other services. These measures are coupled with the creation of the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency which has been given effect by legislation of this parliament already. The question that I think needs to be asked first is, `Did the coalition flag these intentions to the electorate in the 1996 election campaign?'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKAY" NAMEID="9L6">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, as Senator Mackay said. Of course they did not. There has been a lot said in this parliament about mandates to justify the passage of industrial relations legislation and legislation to privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra. The government has thumped its fist on the table and said, `We have a mandate to do this; it is improper for you to oppose it.' In this case, there is no mandate. This was not announced to the public. The closure of the CES and the privatising of this service, whatever the merits, are not mandated items that this government can rely upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question has to be asked, `Did the coalition mislead the electorate on this issue?' I think it did because during the election campaign they actually sent a letter to the Public Sector Union, which represents CES employees, promising to support the CES as a public employment service. If that is the case, there can be no greater deception because this bill is going to abolish the CES. There is no mandate and no honour on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that in 1993 in the election campaign the coalition did have a policy which was consistent with its actions now. That policy was contained in Fightback. In the Fightback document with respect to taxation and expenditure reform for jobs and growth, the Liberal and National Parties planned to rebuild and reward Australia. Fightback was released on 21 November 1991, I think, and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in section 14.12 on page 218 the then policy was that most of the job placement activities would be privatised or contracted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Fightback was rejected by the electorate in 1993, and the government chose not to continue with that policy in the subsequent three years and in the election campaign in 1996. But what are they doing now? They are implementing a policy rejected by the electorate, apparently jettisoned by their party and not part of their campaign. Subsequently, after the election when everyone was told that they could be relaxed and comfortable, when everyone was told that things were not really going to change&mdash;`We're just going to change the parties on the government bench'&mdash;that nothing else was going to change, certainly not in the area of doing away with the CES as far as the letter to the CPSU was concerned, what do we find? We find this very radical legislation before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This type of behaviour on policy gives a lie to the claims of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that his party has acted in accordance with promises made during the election campaign. Fightback did not pretend to be anything other than a blueprint for radical change to the government's role in a number of areas. In 1993 John Hewson claimed to have the snake&hyphen;oil remedy for all of Australia's alleged ills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that everything has changed since the election, so what of these bills? Is it able to be demonstrated that this is a bill proposing radical change? I think I only need to go to statements made by Senator Vanstone, Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in an estimates committee hearing on 18 September 1996. I will read from page 157 of the transcript of that date, when Senator Vanstone said:</PARA>

The only thing you might look at undoing&mdash;I frankly cannot see how you would want to undo it because I think it is a very sensible move to put it together&mdash;is the shopfront, because employment placement services by the public enterprise are still there being provided and competing with private enterprise. You are not wiping it out; you are not getting rid of it. It is there, and it is competing with a genuine competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect, it is a misunderstanding or, shall I say, a misdescription, and, certainly, the wrong impression to have in the back of your mind that this is a jump into a very big, deep pool that has not been tried before and which is irretrievable. Firstly, it has been tried by the previous government and, secondly, you are not throwing out the CES; you are simply corporatising that portion of it which does not go to the shopfront.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Frankly, at that stage, `corporatising' meant creating the CES as the PEPE&mdash;as a statutory corporation. That was clearly in everyone's minds, including the minds of the minister and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But their plans again changed radically in relation to the creation of the public employment placement enterprise. This stepladder out of the deep swimming pool, to use the minister's terms, on I think 10 December, was announced to be created not as a statutory corporation but as a private, commercial corporation not created under legislation, and therefore not accessible to the parliament in terms of its creation or, indeed, its operation. It would operate as another corporation able to be changed, enlarged, reduced or sold
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> without the decision of the parliament. That is the reality of the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This stepladder out of the deep swimming pool that Minister Vanstone told us would be there was being removed. Another alleged mechanism was being created, and very unsatisfactory guarantees were put in place in relation to it. So we can forget the stepladder. The CES will no longer be corporatised as the PEPE. We will have a company established, and people may be transferred across&mdash;but we will see how long that lasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This foray into a new world of labour exchange policy now takes place without a safety net. We can strike out the word `mandate', we can underline the word `radical' and we can strike out the word `caution' in relation to this policy. This is another part of the coalition's let&hyphen;the&hyphen;market&hyphen;provide solution for Australia, particularly in relation to labour exchange services, which will come into effect if this legislation is passed unamended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will the effect be in rural and regional areas if the PEPE exists? I say that because the bill does not reflect its existence. It is unclear what role, if any, it will play in rural, regional and remote areas. The market will get first and second opportunity at the provision of services in any area in the country. Firstly, tenders are to be sought&mdash;I understand the first round of tenders is not on a cost&hyphen;competitive basis&mdash;for the five labour market service providers, including the PEPE, I take it, in the labour market regions that the government has established. At the end of that tender process, work may or may not be allocated to the PEPE, the private employment placement enterprise, and work might be allocated to the community organisations and the private organisations that are seeking to be contracted to provide the services. But, as I understand the situation, there is no guarantee that the PEPE would receive any contracts in that process. There is certainly nothing in the legislation that would guarantee it, nor do I believe that there are any firm guarantees on the record anywhere that the PEPE would receive any contracts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4106">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us assume&mdash;and I think the processes that the department is looking at assume this&mdash;that there will be some areas where there are not acceptable tenders, or there are  no tenders at all. That might mean that even in some areas the PEPE does not tender for work. What will happen then, under this proposal, is that work will be available for operators&mdash;and I understand that this role does not include the PEPE&mdash;to provide a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service in relation to the provision of these five labour market services. So if no&hyphen;one is prepared to competitively tender for the provision of these services, a contract can be let on effectively a pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;do labour market service provision by community or private providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If nobody is prepared to cover the work at that point, the PEPE would be, I take it, directed to fill the gap and to fulfil the Commonwealth's community service obligations, but the Commonwealth would be required to pay only the reasonable cost of the public provider for providing this community service obligation. I take these circumstances to mean that the work in a particular region or a type of work in a particular region was not commercially attractive&mdash;that is, for some reason it was going to be costly to provide or that outcomes were not able to be guaranteed because there was not work available to place people in and that, because this is a payment by results scheme, providers may not wish to tender for work in an area where they do not think they are going to be able to find jobs for people. So here the PEPE will go in, and it will be paid what the department has said will be the reasonable cost of providing the service. There is no guideline as to what that might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might draw the conclusion that it would certainly not be a profitable service, in terms of providing a service, compared with the sorts of services that might be provided under the fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service service arrangement or the tender process arrangement. So these community service obligations will operate in areas where the market fails to produce a provider. Presumably, as I said, the PEPE will already have tendered for the work and it will be forced to take up the uneconomic work&mdash;at
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a so&hyphen;called reasonable cost&mdash;probably at a loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these proposals for rural and regional areas, it is not even guaranteed that all services will be available, and certainly not in all areas, because the guidelines state that in rural and remote areas `it is envisaged that this service would include most activities but at a level suitable to the requirements of the local labour market.' If ever there was a phrase that was code for `this will be a downgraded service' this is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing tenderers to tender for the provision of only part of the service is also a potential problem for rural and remote areas. Naturally, a for&hyphen;profit service will seek out only those areas or services that provide the greatest return. There is no doubt that the experimental nature of this scheme is accentuated by the potential patchwork of arrangements that the scheme is likely to generate. I fear for rural and regional Australia. I do not suggest that current service delivery in that area is optimal at this time, but I do say that, without significant amendment to improve this bill, the risks of this policy, particularly in rural and regional Australia, are too great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have a limited amount of time, I will touch very briefly on the press release that the minister has put out, which effectively says that, if certain amendments to this bill are passed, the government will not proceed with the bill but it will seek to initiate the reforms in any case without the legislation. I find that a remarkable statement. I believe that the government has no mandate to proceed down this path, as I believe I established earlier. To say `if we can't get what we want through the parliament, we will do it anyway through the back door' is absolutely incredible. They are saying, `We don't have a mandate but we are going to do this anyway and, if the parliamentary scrutiny will not allow it, then we will go through the back door.' I think the minister has got to stand up in here to explain to the Australian people why this government is prepared to ignore parliamentary scrutiny, to ignore due process and to try to go through the back door to implement a policy for which it has no mandate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister, John Howard, in the hype leading up to the 1996 election, said he stood for all of us. Last night, the Prime Minister spoke to his real  constituency: corporate Australia. This time it was in the form of the mining industry. He gloated about removing environmental checks and balances from the federal government and reducing labour costs to the mining industry, and he had the front to present the Native Title Act 1993 as giving too much to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. What he meant was that it did not take enough away, in his and corporate Australia's opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are, in context, with another mean&hyphen;spirited, blame the powerless, scapegoating effort. This time the target is the unemployed. It should be pointed out that, when people talk about economic rationalism in Australia, they are referring to a rather bizarre form of what used to be called monetarism. Monetarism, in the context of the 1980s, was an ideology that said, `Government should be small, taxes should be low and the private market rules, okay.' That was monetarism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went along a certain part of this path with the previous government. Part of the reason we find ourselves in the position we are in today in relation to employment services is that in 1995 in this place we pushed through the competition policy legislation. That is a huge sleeping giant&mdash;unfortunately, it is not sleeping very soundly. It means that, by next year, all services need to be reviewed&mdash;and all legislation in relation to federal, state and local governments needs to be reviewed&mdash;to see if they are anti&hyphen;competitive. It means that service provision everywhere&mdash;not just by choice of governments&mdash;will have to comply to competition policy, unless there is a specific exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked. I have not seen any bills that provide an exemption to competition policy. We need to have a well overdue look at what the rest of the Senate&mdash;not the Greens&mdash;signed up to in 1995 to see what we are heading into. It is all very well for the ALP to now say, `Isn't it dreadful how this is being implemented?' They set up the bill in 1995.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a great deal of concern about the way the legislation was rushed through in 1995, about what the potential implications were and about whether we, as a country, were the least bit prepared for what we were jumping into. We claimed at the time that we were not. Two years on it really is time to look at this&mdash;at where we are going, how far we have got, what the implications for people are and what they could be by next year, when the bill crunches in. In the not too distant future, I intend to propose a full review of the 1995 competition policy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit rich for the Labor Party to come in now and say, `Isn't it dreadful how this is being implemented?' Yes, it is dreadful. But it is also the policy that was put in in 1995 in relation to competition policy. It did not direct that labour market programs should be privatised, but it basically said that state, federal and local services would go along in that direction, unless specifically exempted. I believe it is time we looked at the bill that was pushed through here in 1995. It is time we looked at the human, social and environmental implications&mdash;and any other implications&mdash;of what the two major parties in this chamber signed up to in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another major issue in relation to perceptions here. What we see now is that the unemployed are becoming the victims of the theatre of politics. We know that in 1993 the Greens pointed out that there was a big hole of around $5 billion in the budget calculations. This hole, we pointed out, belonged to the labour market programs. In 1994, up came the $5 billion in the form of the Working Nation program. It got recycled, it came up by way of Working Nation and was proclaimed as a big new spending package. It was not a big new spending package. The only people who noticed that it was pulled out of the budget in 1993 were the Greens. Some other people caught on later, but they forgot it over time. So we had a `big new spending package', which never was a big new spending package. It was a transfer of programs, it was a revitalisation but it was not a big new spending package.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4108">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having produced the theatre of the big new spending package, we then had the theatre of the opposition saying, `You have spent big with $5 billion.' Then we had, `We've spent big', `You've spent too much', across the chamber. Having built on the politics of  perception and the theatre of politics, the now opposition is in no position to say, `If you are pulling billions of dollars out of this program, it never was a new spending program.' They cannot do that, because they always said it was a big new spending program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now, in the form of the government's new program for the work for your poverty scheme, is an ideologically driven program. It is not yet required under competition policy, but by 1998 it may well be. It is driven by the fact that private must be good and public or community must be bad. In the case of not for profit organisations, you have incentives. People work there because they believe they are doing the right thing. They believe in serving the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is in an accountable area such as the provision of government services or it is in the area of the provision of community services in terms of employment programs and so on that are run by a whole range of agencies in the community, there is an incentive within those groups to provide that service for the community. They are being pitted against the private for profit sector, and it does not take much to work out that, if one is competing with the other at the same price, one has a profit margin and the other is putting their profit back into the community. Therefore, it would seem that we will be getting less value from the private sector than we may well be getting from the community sector. The motivations would need to be checked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual running of the program becomes extremely difficult to monitor to make sure that we are not going to get the inevitable creaming off of the system which comes when you have got a for&hyphen;profit sector which has an incentive to place and is provided with this great little excuse, which is already sorted out, in relation to those people who are less likely or are unlikely to find employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think the `capacity to benefit' test is an extraordinary provision because it talks about people personally but it also indicates that certain parts of Australia may be classified as basket cases. We will get enclaves of disadvantage and we will get enclaves of lack of assistance within Australia. I just wonder how the government will come in then and justify what they are going to be doing in relation to those people who fall out of their category who are then labelled and stigmatised. We are going back decades in relation to the basic human dignity of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is similar to the Alan Jones approach to social justice. I know that in a promo to one of his programs you had an unemployed person, just after the budget was announced, saying, `Look, I just want to talk about the issue of money available to unemployed people. I have been unemployed for six years.' The response was something like, `Oh well, you are just a layabout. It is your fault.' That is the approach that has been taken by the government. That is the approach we have had on many occasions from Senator Newman: `We would like to trust these people but, gosh, there are people who are cheats.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore we get the impression that it is the fault of the unemployed to be unemployed, that it is the fault of the long&hyphen;term unemployed that there are problems as to why they cannot get a job. They are assumed to be guilty unless they can somehow or other prove themselves to be innocent. People have approached my office who have been summarily taken off their unemployment benefit, for a technicality sometimes, and frequently for mistakes of the system, and they then have the responsibility of proving that the system has treated them badly. It is like a huge fine. We would never do this to business. Can you imagine fining someone who has got nothing the equivalent of $500? It is outrageous. But we are doing that because it is part of the scapegoat politics which is popular at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to look at the future, we need to look at where this country is going and we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4109"> need to look at the fact that this policy is pushing for a more and more divided Australia. The poverty trap has been set and the ability of people to work out of the poverty trap is in question. I just wonder whether in the future we will move even further, to forced labour or indentured labour. That is what it is likely to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are already finding in the last couple of years in Western Australia that the ability of people to opt for community service for minor offences rather than for fines they cannot pay has been removed in a number of instances. One wonders whether that was a sort of preparation for a work for the dole scheme. Now if you are unemployed you will be punished&mdash;it is not optional; you will be punished&mdash;by being put into what somebody, perhaps a private company, thinks is your correct and appropriate punishment. So, instead of people being able to do community service in many instances, say, in the state systems, there are some categories of people who can no longer access community service, and now that is the punishment, the punishment for being unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, there are people who are unemployed, and certainly a lot of young people, who would like the opportunity of getting meaningful work experience, but that is not the same. We have seen the government pull out the money from the LEAP scheme and we have seen it go to a scheme called Green Corps, which is much less in monetary terms, much less in numbers, and often means that people, instead of being involved in something that they think is worth while and the community thinks is worth while, end up being unwilling participants in something they do not understand. It is not all willing people; it is often people who really feel that they have been targeted for being bad, targeted for being unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is the kind of Australia I would like to live in and I think it is time that people understand where the decisions are coming from and take action. One of those actions perhaps is to call for a major review of competition policy, a major review of the direction we are going in, which sees that `Economic fundamentalism rules&mdash;okay?' in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia&mdash;no matter what the social cost, no matter what other costs are involved, no matter what the outcomes are, as long as it is ideologically driven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that all people in this chamber could believe that it is time after two years to review competition policy. I do not think anybody in a major party can pretend that their parties were not fully a part of that decision. It was a policy that was put forward by the Labor Party and it was a policy that was fully supported by the then opposition, and there was almost no debate. Of course, the people who were concerned included the local government associations, who are still vitally concerned about the outcomes, especially in rural and regional Australia but not solely in those areas. People are finding out that their decisions are being overridden now&mdash;or potentially will be in the future&mdash;because their rules or their legislation somehow do not conform to a very odd idea of what is competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And why should they? There are other values in this society, and democracy demands that people have the ability to be represented for values other than corporate profit. But, funnily enough, that is not what is happening at the moment. So, before we go too far down this track, it is time for a very urgent review of where we are going in this country and what the outcomes are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the not too distant future honourable senators can expect me to be putting forward a proposal for a two&hyphen;yearly review of competition policy. I hope that those people from the Labor Party who are concerned about how, both at a federal level and at the state and territory levels, competition policy is currently being implemented will participate fully in that debate, because I know there are many people in the community who are ready and more than willing to come forward and give their evidence about the implications of what has gone on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the political equivalent of kicking the cat. It is the political equivalent of scapegoating the CES because of the appalling record this government has in relation to unemployment. Unemployment has gone up in the last 18 months but, instead of doing anything fundamental about that, this government is choosing to kick the cat, to dismantle the CES and blame those workers in the CES for its appalling record and its appalling outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation before us goes by the misnomer `reform'&mdash;Reform of Employment Services Bill. This bill is not about reform. Reform implies something positive, improvement, righting wrongs, making things better. There is no reform in this bill. There is a dismantling, a taking apart, an annihilation, of a system that has been in existence for in excess of 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The title of the bill uses the words `employment services', another absolute misnomer. The kindest thing you could call it is a disservice in terms of the outcomes that it is going to deliver to the Australian people. The legislation effectively removes services for the unemployed and it abandons them in their hundreds of thousands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator O'Brien has already pointed out, this government has no mandate for this legislation. The government did not announce plans to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service in its 1996 election campaign. In fact, as has been pointed out, in correspondence to the CPSU, the government promised to support the CES as a public employment service. When the now government announced in 1993 its intention to `privatise or contract out' most of the job placement activities at the CES, what happened in that 1993 election? You did not get in. The now government did not get in. That
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy, along with a whole range of other policies, received a resounding `no' from the people of Australia. So here we go again. It is the Fightback agenda by the back the backdoor with no mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a blatant attempt to meet the budget bottom line, again, at the expense of those least able to afford it&mdash;that is, the unemployed of Australia. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reported on Monday, 5 May, the Treasurer has had to concede that his employment strategies have not worked and his jobless target of 8.5 per cent will not be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Treasurer, Labor keeps its promises to the unemployed of the country. At the time of the 1993 election, Labor promised to create half a million jobs over three years. Not only did we achieve that target; we exceeded it. We created 714,000 jobs in less than three years. We did this at the same time as increasing participation in the work force by Australian women. Under this government, women are leaving the work force in droves. In the month of March, 50,000 women left the work force or stopped looking for work&mdash;the worst fall in the participation rate of women since September 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We created jobs without abandoning disadvantaged job seekers. We did it through Working Nation. We focused on active market assistance and education and training. We believe that every Australian has a capacity to benefit. We focused on disadvantaged job seekers and disadvantaged areas. We provided necessary infrastructure for job seeker training. We developed regional employment strategies. We involved local business and local communities in the decision making, and we were well on the way to five per cent unemployment by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of building on the success of Working Nation, this government has slashed funds to labour market programs&mdash;in fact, as everybody knows, over $1.8 billion nationwide. This slashing and burning of labour market programs is being felt disproportionately in regional Australia. Over $40 million has been taken from my home state of Tasmania alone&mdash;the state, incidentally, with the highest unemployment rate in Australia and the state,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4111"> incidentally, that is going to be one of the worst affected by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government plans to abolish the CES. The government has the temerity to call this reform. Instead of publicly funded, universally available employment services, we will now have the employment placement enterprises, EPEs&mdash;the profit driven employment placement enterprises. The CES was established to  match people to jobs. Over time, the role expanded to actively assisting the long-term unemployed and those disadvantaged in the job market. Profit has never been a motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about profit, let us talk about those community groups who work tirelessly for no profit. How will they fare in being able to set up an EPE? The reality is that there is no guarantee that community groups which wish to become EPEs will be able to do so. There is every likelihood that they will find it impossible to compete with large private enterprises with considerable capital and existing infrastructure available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisations do not have the capacity to compete with large groups like Benson and Drake International. The cost of public relations and general running expenses is huge. There is every likelihood that large cartels will dominate the employment market. It does not sound much like competition, does it? It does not sound much like competition because it is not going to be much like competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons why the whole issue of contracting out such a vital public service should be questioned. The issue of public accountability lies at the very heart of this bill. As the Public Research Centre of the University of New South Wales said to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, government services have `complex and multiple objectives'. The research points to the ever present risk of corruption in contracting processes. The centre's submission went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contracting process can diminish transparency and public accountability in public administration and service
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision through `commercial in confidence' declarations and restrictions on freedom of information provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Under the changes proposed in this bill, the power of the government to scrutinise the activities of its services to the unemployed is severely diminished. In answer to my question in this chamber with regard to abuse of confidential information by former departmental officers in Tasmania who wished to set up an EPE, Minister Vanstone could only reply that there were reports that the problem was widespread and that she would have a look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evidence of the potential for corruption is merely the tip of the iceberg. I repeat: EPEs will be profit making ventures to which vital social services will be contracted out. You cannot contract out responsibility. EPEs will receive a fee for placing a client in employment. People who need intensive help and training will be, as has been pointed out by a number of senators, less attractive to the EPE than those who can find work quickly and return a fast profit to the EPE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> With no fee, the CES helps anyone who wants help to find a job. Under the new regime, job seekers will receive help to find work only if they are in receipt of benefit or fit specific categories. Anyone else will go onto the scrap heap or will have to pay a fee for service. Through the CES, people have access to a wide range of assistance: training, wage subsidies, even assistance to move to another location if necessary in relation to the search for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EPE will receive some money up front to place a person in employment. How much of that fee will be spent on the job seeker is the decision of the EPE&mdash;that is, after the salaries, rent, insurance, electricity, and telephone costs and so on are taken out. The waste through duplication of services and resources defies any sense at all; it defies logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the CES, a job seeker receives help for as long as necessary to overcome any barrier to employment or until a person returns to education or, hopefully, gets a job. If the job is lost within 13 weeks, that person
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4112"> can return to the level of assistance they were receiving before they got the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EPEs have 12 months to find a person a job. In some circumstances, that continue for a further six months. But if at the end of 12 months a person has no job they lose the right to get intensive employment assistance. The only way a person can get further assistance is to find a job by themselves and, if they lose the job, they need to reapply for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the safeguards? Under this legislation the job seeker cannot change EPEs if he or she is dissatisfied or if the EPE makes unreasonable demands of them&mdash;like moving to a different area, for example, away from infrastructure, family, whatever&mdash;and then threatens them with a breach if they do not comply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CES is free. The staff are trained, experienced and skilled public servants. Training, counselling, access to phones, fax and photocopier&mdash;all that sort of thing&mdash;are free. The EPE can and will charge for anything over and above the basic service for people referred by the agency. People who are not referred can be charged for even the most basic service. So we will be moving away from a publicly funded service for the unemployed to private concerns driven by the profit motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is flying in the face of reports which demonstrate that the CES has been vital in the fight to put all unemployed Australians back into work. The client surveys report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National survey of employer satisfaction</EMPHASIS>, published by DEETYA stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">85% of employers were satisfied with the services provided by the CES.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why change that? It does not make any sense. If it is working, why change it? Despite this, this government would have us all believe that this move to a market for employment services is an improvement. ACOSS said in their submission to the Senate hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very risky experiment for unemployed people, for whom the labour market has rarely delivered a fair outcome. This market failure provides a powerful case for government intervention in the labour market to ensure that the most disadvantaged and long-term unemployed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people are re-connected with secure employment and can participate fully in society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requires the development, over an extensive period of time, of a network of stable, high quality employment assistance providers to provide counselling, training, employment experience, and job referral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These providers must be encouraged to assist the most disadvantaged unemployed people into stable employment&mdash;as distinct from picking the `easiest jobs' or cutting their costs by offering only superficial training and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis for such a network already exists and it is vital that this is not destroyed in the process of reform.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This so-called reform would not be the subject of so much concern if we could be confident that a mechanism was being put in place to ensure that those people not helped by the EPE would receive assistance from another source. However, as has been pointed out, at no stage have we received an assurance that employment services will be delivered in the regions which have the greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Tasmania we attempted to get some assurance that there would at least be a PEPE based in Tasmania to pick up any market failure in relation to EPEs. We could not get that guarantee. This is a state with the highest unemployment rate, with what is essentially a microcosm of a regional economy, and we could not get that commitment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier assurances from the government led many people to believe that any gaps in the services provided by the EPEs would be covered by another new body, the public placement enterprise&mdash;the PEPE. This PEPE is supposed to fill the gaps left by other providers. If a commercial EPE does not set up in a certain remote or rural area, the minister may direct the PEPE to provide services as part of a community service obligation. But the PEPE is to be a company. The establishment and operational parameters of the PEPE are not in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no guarantee under this legislation in its current form that the PEPE will continue. At any time, for any reason, the government could decide to axe the PEPE. This would leave rural and remote areas without any access to service. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this is precisely what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4113"> the government is planning to do in the long term&mdash;get rid of the PEPE all together and have the private sector running employment services in this country completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  Incorporating the PEPE has ramifications for service delivery in regional Australia. This legislation gives no assurances that areas of high unemployment or with small or widely dispersed populations will receive an equitable service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the issue of who gets help to find work. People will be divided into three groups&mdash;I think as Senator Kernot indicated&mdash;in this brave new world. The first group is defined as those who need little or no assistance to find work. They will have access to labour exchange services only. This bill does not provide for basic employment assistance such as self&hyphen;help labour exchanges or employment counselling or access to financial assistance with the direct costs of a job search. These services should be a basic minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group are identified as those who are needing intensive employment assistance. These are the ones from whom the EPE will make their profit. At least they will get some help, however inferior it may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question as to how long a person should receive employment assistance has been a real bugbear for the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs under this government. They had to come up with a way to get people off assistance&mdash;hence, the 12&hyphen;month rule. As evidenced by an internal CES e-mail, limiting access to employment assistance to 12 months provided a convenient way to get people off assistance. One such e-mail concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you could well say that what we ended up with&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the 12&hyphen;month rule&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">did not go far enough to allow case managers to move out all the clients they would like to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But consider that every client affected by any of these new clauses is one more than they could previously exit, and count the blessings. The twelve month rule alone could affect 60,000 clients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not me saying this. I am not saying this. It is the CES workers themselves saying this. They are saying this, not me. The fact is that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 60,000 job seekers could lose their entitlement to employment assistance simply because they have not found a job within 12 months. They have few blessings to count.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third group will not be referred to an EPE, as they are those who will be classified as having `no capacity to benefit' from employment assistance. What a damning term that is&mdash;no capacity to benefit. These people will be relegated to the unemployment scrap heap and they will receive no assistance at all. These people, and I will quote again from a CES internal e-mail, include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . violent clients, pregnant clients, Aboriginals in remote locations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Think about that. The bill is also deficient on the subject of appeal processes for job seekers who are unhappy with the EPE to which they were referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submission from the CPSU raised the concern that 30 per cent of job seekers would effectively be excluded from the appeal process by the requirement that complaints must be in writing. There is no recognition of the fact that many job seekers are functionally illiterate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will the government offer young unemployed people instead of labour market programs and the full support of the Commonwealth Employment Service? Work for the dole. There is no sunset clause with regard to work for the dole. This means the government can, without recourse to parliament, force all recipients of unemployment benefits into working for their entitlements. Failure to comply with work for the dole rules will result in loss of benefit. This is a clear attempt to force people off benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are moral and ethical problems associated with forcing people to work for what has always been considered a right&mdash;that is, support while without paid employment. The bill, if passed in the current form, leaves the door open for work for the dole but provides no detail as to how this scheme will operate. There are no details about important issues such as training for the participants, no guarantees that paid jobs will not be lost and no reference to superannuation, workers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4114"> compensation, occupational health and safety and on and on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployed of this country are not the only ones whose future is put at risk by this bill. What of the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service? What is their future? We already know that the government wants to dismantle the Australian Public Service. We have already had an admission that public servants can do the same job for differing rates of pay depending on the state of the  labour market in the area in which they live. We have already had that admission from the Department of Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are between 5,500 and 6,000 people available in the CES to work with the PEPE. However, the PEPE will only need somewhere between 1,800 and 2,500 staff based on business levels. What will happen to the others? What sorts of guarantees do they have? Another internal departmental memo reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to accept the reality that we will be providing employment for less than 50 per cent of our current staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to accept that the PEPE does not have responsibility for the employment of CES staff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be able to `headhunt' the best staff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not have a Public Service `selection exercise'&mdash;if we do the PEPE will be a failure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 public servants can join the queue at the labour exchange and get themselves to an EPE under this legislation. Those who retain employment must also retain full Australian Public Service employment conditions. The same conditions must apply to any future PEPE employees. Clearly, this bill has no regard for people. It must be opposed in its current form.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mackay said that an essential problem with the Reform of Employment Services Bill 1996 [1997] is the lack of detail. That is correct. The second reading speech said that this legislation purports to affect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most radical changes to employment services since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is so, surely this chamber needs to know some more detail about how this scheme is to work than is presently available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, at an estimates committee hearing, we were given a booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exposure Draft: Tendering conditions and draft contract for employment services</EMPHASIS>. On page 30 of that booklet, the following passage appears:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is preparing to go to tender for a new employment services market. Tenders are to be called for five different kinds of employment services in 29 regions. The tender process will be one of the largest and most complex ever conducted in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That would seem to mean that the 29 regions which are set out in appendix 3 of the exposure draft will be up for tender and that the particular employment provider that wins that tender will then provide services within that region. That will mean, as I understand it&mdash;and perhaps the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) will explain this later&mdash;that only one person, one body or one corporation will provide employment services within that particular region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is so, where then is the competition that is said will lead to a much better provision of services? I make that point again&mdash;if there is only one successful tenderer in each region, how can it be said that this is a system that will rely on competition? Isn't it rather a system that provides for 29 monopolies which people will have to go to if they want to find employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very serious implications in that. On page 27 of the exposure draft, the following outline of the contract appears:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4115">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the provisions of the legislation, contracts will be "Employment Services Agreements" (for employment services generally) and "Employment Assistance Agreements"  (for Employment Assistance). This means that contracted service providers are bound by the provisions of the legislation&mdash;for example, Employment Assistance Providers may act as delegates of the Employment Secretary in negotiating an Employment Assistance Activity Agreement with a participant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, as I understand the scheme, a person who provides employment not only will have a monopoly but also, in certain respects, will  have the powers of the employment secretary. A senior official of the Commonwealth will have the secretary's powers within that monopoly. That is a matter of considerable concern, I would have thought, for the way we are going to handle very vulnerable people under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the present system we have CES officers, who are officials of the Commonwealth, and people can go down and deal with them. If they have any complaints, they can complain to their local member, to other people or to the Public Service itself and perhaps something can be done. But what is the position where you have private people taking over those functions and holding the powers that very senior officials within the government hold?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the minister has turned her mind to that issue. There is set out in both the Reform of Employment Services Bill and the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill provisions that try to overcome the situation that might well be created by having private people do what was formerly done by the Public Service. In these are provisions which attempt, in any event, to make applicable to private agents the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Ombudsman's act, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That raises this issue: if competition is going to be the order of the day and if it is going to provide the protections that are needed to ensure that various people&mdash;I will come to them&mdash;who are touched by this scheme are protected from injustice, why do we need these various provisions, this quite rigorous regime of cheques and balances, to keep the system in order? Is this a privatisation of a public scheme or a nation
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alisation of private providers of employment services? It could be looked at either way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a public system of providing employment, albeit under the last government private interests clearly were introduced to the scheme further down the ladder to enable services to be carried out. If we are going to go from a public system to a private system, what protections are we going to have? If the protections are those that are set out in the legislation, what do they do for the effectiveness with which the private providers provide the particular services they are supposed to provide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have a dichotomy here. You have a very difficult scheme. It is difficult because nothing is identified and it is not quite clear as to what should happen. As for the people who are going to go through the system&mdash;no matter whether they are the people who provide the services or accept the services&mdash;what is their position in trying to work out what the present scheme is all about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the provisions of the legislation, the employment secretary is to make agreements with service providers on behalf of the Commonwealth. There are some tests which the minister will set out as to what these people who take on the contracts with the employment secretary should agree to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, at least, that there is going to be an official of the government who will make contracts with private providers of services to help people who are out of work. But when you look further into the legislation you find that, although the employment secretary can do these things, he has the power to delegate his functions to other people. He can delegate the very important function of trying to get proper providers of services for people who are out of work to any officer of his department or a member of the staff of the agency. We then come to the concept of an agency, which, as we have tried to trace our way through this morass, we have not heard of up until now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the definitions section of the Reform of the Employment Services Bill 1996 we find that `agency' means the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4116"> which was established by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1996. We say to ourselves that that must be a body which has specific purposes within the field of delivering services to the unemployed. But when we look at that act&mdash;the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997&mdash;it is not specific at all to the provision of services. As far as I can see, there is no expertise within the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency in terms of employment and getting jobs for people without them or for training people who need it so that they can get jobs. It is difficult to comprehend why there is this reference to the agency within this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go from the Reform of Employment Services Bill itself to the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1996, which is short and to a certain extent very sharp, in part 1 the whole of the Employment Services Act 1994 is repealed. This has already been spoken about. That means the end, of course, of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It might well have been a wise thing to keep that body in operation while this new scheme was tested, because, as the minister has said, this is the most radical change to employment services that has been brought forward for a long time. To do away in one sweep with the systems that we have had before when we are very unsure of the system that we are putting in place, and when the system that we are putting in place is in uncharted waters, seems to be courageous, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few things I would like to say in relation to the second reading speech which have already been said, but need to be said again. In the second reading speech the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms to labour market services in the bills should also be seen in the broader context of the government's commitments to deficit reduction and budgetary discipline. These commitments are essential for increasing the growth capacity of the Australian economy and ultimately for delivering sustained reductions in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that did happen, then there could be nothing but praise for the scheme undertaken, but again it leads to confusion. What is the scheme about? Is it a scheme that is attempt
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing to get people back into work, provide services to people and to help people regain their confidence and the skills that they need to work? Or is it to save the budget and to make sure that the deficit does not go any further so that more money can go into producing jobs? Or is it a bit of both and, if so, what balance is to be struck between them? The Commonwealth Employment Services is to be abolished by this radical change and surely these sorts of things should be planned and thought about before we go into this radical scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page two of the second reading speech six principles for the reform of the employment services are set out and when you look at them, people could not but praise the aspirations that they hold. People could have a great deal of trouble trying to work out just how these aspirations are going to be realised. I will just go through them very quickly. The first principle is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assistance to job seekers should be based on their individual needs and their capacity to benefit from it in terms of achieving an employment outcome.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is there in this legislation, the exposure draft of the tendering conditions and in the contract itself that in any way gives any indication of how that is to be done, except to simply say that the private sector will fix it up somehow? That is the private sector that we trust to the extent of imposing all sorts of obligations upon them by making them applicable to the Crimes Act 1914, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Privacy Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and so on. There seems to be great confusion there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second principle is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providers should have access to flexible forms of assistance that fit the needs of job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, but how is that aspiration to be realised? The third principle is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentive framework should reward providers of labour market assistance primarily for placing job seekers in real jobs, with additional incentives for those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes, but are we going to do that by giving 29 providers of labour market assistance the monopoly in each area that I discussed before? The fourth principle is:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4117">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A competitive market for employment placement services should separate purchaser from providers and ensure that providers operate on the basis of competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure what that means. No doubt the minister, in her usual lucid way, will explain that. The fifth principle is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conditions for payment of income support for unemployed people should be linked closely with active employment assistant measures.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But as you read through the second reading speeches, the exposure drafts, the bills and the explanatory memorandum, none of that is explained. And, finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job seekers and employers should be able to receive high quality and streamlined service from the agencies and providers with which they interact.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And of course they should be but, again, the problem is that these things are not explained to us. The real issue in this matter is how the proper aspirations, how the good ambitions that the minister has, can be realised, and that is not explained in the present circumstances. That is why this matter should be discussed, and discussed at length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem that I have is this. There is a scheme set up here but the proposals to improve the employment situation in Australia in the government's mind are such that it could easily take, it says, an alternative measure. It could get rid of all this legislation and use a means other than enactments to create what it wants. If it is so essential to have this legislation, why is there a strong alternative to be able to do without it? Just what are we going to provide for those people now out of work?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate, in spite of the fact that I disagree with a large portion of what has been said. I express some regret that it is clear that some senators still do not understand not only the government's intention, but also the legislative process that is in front of them&mdash;that is, what the bill actually says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could spend just a few minutes outlining what the government intends to do vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis this bill. What we intend to do is to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pick up the best of Working Nation. We have been very critical of the previous government's Working Nation program where we think it failed, and we have disposed of those portions, as best we can, that we think did fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it was the wrong thing to put people on training programs when there was no job at the end. That might have satisfied the bureaucrats and kept them busy&mdash;whether they were in the public, private or community sector&mdash;but if, in the end, it did not result in a real job for the person who was on benefits and looking to get off benefits, we say you did not achieve the end that you wanted to achieve. There has never been any suggestion on our part that Working Nation was put together in bad faith. It might have had an eye on the electoral cycle, but it was not in bad faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to rehearse again and again the things that we think were wrong other than to say that to put people through programs that are not effective is not a sensible thing to do. As I have indicated, we have got rid of a significant number of those programs. With respect to those programs, to pay providers&mdash;that is, private providers not in the public sector, or community providers&mdash;for what we call an outcome&mdash;it was Labor that shifted originally to outcome payments&mdash;and to say that it is an outcome that you have put someone in a six&hyphen;month training program that does not necessarily result in a job, we think is the wrong thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For someone who is on a benefit and looking for a job, the outcome that they want is a job. They want a real lasting job that will be there when the Commonwealth money runs out. That is what they all want and I do not presume there is any disagreement about that. So we are shifting to a system where those people who get contracts from the Commonwealth will get paid when they get people jobs. It is just that simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken about the parts of Working Nation that I thought were a complete failure and a huge waste of money. Something like $780 million or $870 million in the previous
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4118"> financial year was spent on programs that had a 20 or 30 per cent effectiveness rate. If you were to go to the taxpayers of Australia and to the unemployed&mdash;people who are not yet paying tax&mdash;and say, `The government is concerned about the plight of unemployed Australians. Do you think it is a good thing if we spend towards a billion dollars on programs that only have a 20 or 30 per cent effectiveness rate or should we try for something better?', I would be very surprised if you found anyone who was not prepared to say, `You should try for something better.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployed Australians deserve better than what we were able to put together. I do not say that to imply that Labor just dished up a whole lot of crummy ineffective programs without caring. I think Labor genuinely tried in the Working Nation program to make a difference, but the point is that we could see fairly early on that it was not working. It was taking people off long&hyphen;term unemployment and just churning them around and they would come back onto short&hyphen;term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, another fault in the targeting of the program was that it was targeted only at the long&hyphen;term unemployed and not at those at risk of becoming long&hyphen;term unemployed. I have no difficulty with targeting the long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;they deserve our help above all others&mdash;but if you forget to look at the people at risk of falling into that bucket, then you are taking people out of the long&hyphen;term unemployed bucket as more people come in. And so we have made that alteration. I think that concludes what I want to say about the negatives of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first positive aspect was that Labor clearly recognised that, when you are long&hyphen;term unemployed, it is damned hard to get a job. The services traditionally available from the CES may well not be appropriate. The people who were long&hyphen;term unemployed not just deserved, but needed, more targeted assistance&mdash;targeted to them. So they developed a system they called case management where some long&hyphen;term unemployed people&mdash;some, not all; there was never an uncapped, unlimited right of access to case management&mdash;got access to this case management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was someone who would speak with you regularly, plan what you would be doing to get a job&mdash;whether you needed to have some training, whether you had grooming problems, whether you needed English language training, computer training, whatever&mdash;and they would try to generate opportunities for you. That was a very creative aspect of Working Nation. It recognised something that we all should have recognised years ago&mdash;that long&hyphen;term unemployed people need one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one assistance. That is one of the most creative aspects of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second creative aspect was recognising that the public provider was not the be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all. Labor recognised that and said that with this proposal for working one on one together in case management they would not have a single provider, the CES; they would shift away from that. They created a portion of the CES called Employment Action Australia, and then said that this task of case managing people one on one would be divided up between the public provider, private providers and community providers&mdash;people like the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and Centapact, who have a very real overriding interest, not just a money interest, in getting the contracts to help the long-term employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are the two creative aspects of Working Nation: looking at people on a one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one basis and spreading the work around so that there is a choice of provider, so that there is competition&mdash;it was Labor that introduced this&mdash;and that competition will work to produce better services for unemployed people. We think they were very creative aspects, and they are the aspects that we are picking up and wanting to expand. It is, as I say, just that simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a couple of, I think, mis&hyphen;statements of the case. I understand Senator Evans was a little bit ungracious today in saying that the legislation before the house was abandoning the long-term employed, whereas in fact it is targeted primarily at the long-term unemployed and those at risk of going into the long&hyphen;term unemployment bucket and that is where about 90 per cent of the effort and money in relation to this matter
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4119"> goes. So we have taken that advice, recognised that aspect of Working Nation and added to it by saying that we will look at the people who are at risk of falling in as well and they are the people we want to give priority to in relation to government funds. We want them to be the first call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand some of the other arguments that have been raised. Wouldn't it be nice if anybody could just walk in? If I felt like getting a different job, I could just walk into  the CES and take up someone's time discussing options of where else I could be employed. I am sure some Labor people could offer a few suggestions, but wouldn't it be outrageous if someone with a job took up the time of the CES at the expense of someone who is long-term employed, does not have a job, is on a benefit and wants to get off it? I think, with respect, those on the other side have their priorities wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to give our undivided attention to the long-term unemployed, the people who are on benefits and who want to get off those benefits. We have towards 800,000 people who are unemployed&mdash;and that statistic is from the ABS, not Social Security. Hundreds of thousands of people are on unemployment benefits&mdash;and they are not sitting around on a couch doing nothing. They are not, as I think it was Mr Beazley who said, sitting around on a couch or out causing trouble on the streets. The vast majority of these people want a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our legislation is very tightly targeted. I admit that. We are not now saying any man and his dog can come in and get this help. Any man and his dog can come in and get first up access to a world-class vacancy database. They can look for jobs in their local area, in their state or Australia wide. They can search to their heart's content without having to be in a subservient position before a clerk at the counter. They can look through one industry and, if they think they would like to try another industry, they can look through that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone has not used the touch screens at the CES, I strongly recommend that they do. They are a world-class innovation in delivering services to the unemployed. And that, of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, is available to everyone. But when people want to say, `I want more than that. I want some real help and impetus in getting a job,' we think it is the appropriate decision&mdash;and I make no bones about this and we make no apologies for it&mdash;that every dollar we can spend should be spent on those who are on a benefit, who are unemployed and looking for work. They should come before anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that concludes my general summary of where we want to go, and I will now quickly go through a couple of other points that have been made. I note that Senator Kernot thinks there is scope for fly&hyphen;by&hyphen;night shonks to get in. I do not see how she can come to that conclusion. By and large, it has not happened with the case management arrangements that Labor introduced. If anything, there was more scope under those arrangements, but that did not happen. We are confident, on the basis of the experiment tried by Labor, that the extension of this experiment will be as good, if not better, in terms of the monitoring of contracts. In fact, I am sure it will be better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot says there is no assurance of outcomes. What assurance of outcomes do unemployed people have today? What assurance does anybody who wants to vote against this legislation offer that the existing system offers them? We have had pretty well 13 years of the existing system&mdash;the last two with some very welcomed modifications&mdash;and what can we say that system produces? Can anyone over there say that they can guarantee an outcome to someone? It seems to me a little  cheap and flippant to come in and say to us, `Well, you can't guarantee&mdash;' when none of you could either when you were in government. You know no government can give people an absolute guarantee that, if they go through this process, they will get a job. But we can give this guarantee: our first priority will be the people on benefits who want to get a job, and they will come before everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sense a little deja vu in this debate that perhaps we are wasting our time and going through an act we have all seen before in that Senator Kernot has made up her mind: she is philosophically opposed to the concept of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4120"> competition providing better services. I think she and a couple of other senators mentioned they are opposed to privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can have a debate on privatisation if we want, and we would say they are the party that always say they are against privatisation&mdash;with hands up and promise, promise, promise never to privatise the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;whoops, we will sell half; promise, promise, promise we will not sell the other&mdash;whoops, now we think we will; promise, promise, promise we will not sell Qantas&mdash;whoops, we will; promise, promise, promise we are opposed to privatisation&mdash;whoops, we have to do it in New South Wales; promise, promise, promise we are against a sales tax&mdash;whoops, we have to have a bed tax in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really, it does come to the point where the people opposite make people over here wonder how on earth they ever stayed in power for 13 years. I have to say that we on this side have to take responsibility for that, because they were so hopeless as a government that they could not have got elected on their record. It must have been because we were not good enough. It certainly was not that they were good enough in the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we can have a debate on privatisation, but in the end I would say, `Hold on, let me just point out, before we waste a lot of time, that this bill is not about privatisation.' It is not about privatisation. I hear this rubbish that people are peddling about privatising the CES or abolishing the CES. What an unmitigated load of rubbish. You people sitting over there, those of you who can read&mdash;and, looking around, I think everybody there can; most of the senators here I think have had a pretty reasonable interest in this, except for Senator Brown, who I have never seen show any interest in this bill at all&mdash;understand that it is not about privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are simply doing two things with the CES. We are sensibly saying&mdash;and you have agreed to this, thank heavens&mdash;`Why are we making unemployed people run between the CES and the Department of Social Security?' What idiot ever devised a formula that said, `Put the two close together so unemployed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people can walk between them'? Once you have grasped the concept that unemployed people have to go to both, why not, in their interest, put both together in the shopfront? We thank the Senate for agreeing to that very sensible reform. But of course that is only the shopfront aspect of the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining parts of the CES that do the work of job placement, labour exchange and now the case management will be put together in one separate unit, which will be the public employment placement enterprise taken out of the Public Service and corporatised. I have spent hours and hours successfully arguing for the benefits of those people. I think the union were very surprised. They came with their war sticks ready to do battle and slightly had their breath taken away by the offer we could make. I know the CPSU do not want the remaining part of the CES to be corporatised, but they cannot say that they think we could offer better conditions than have been offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People can return to the Public Service and have lifetime access, if they stay there, to Commonwealth super&mdash;that is for the individual staffers. For those of you who are interested, perhaps we can go through some of those details in the committee stage&mdash;almost unprecedented in the care that I have personally taken and senior officers in the department have taken to ensure very good staffing conditions for those people. But still we have people saying, `No, we're not going to let you go ahead with this because we are more concerned about the conditions of people with a job, and we are more concerned with the ideology of shifting something into a company than we are with letting you proceed with something which might have a chance of delivering better outcomes.' So it has been, I think, a slightly depressing debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make one more point with respect to Senator Margetts's contribution. Senator Margetts raised the issue of the capacity to benefit test. For those who are not familiar with this, it is a test that basically says, when a job seeker comes to this shopfront, `Would you be suitable? Would you benefit from what we call intensive employment assistance'&mdash;because it will be slightly different from what you refer to as case
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4121"> management; but we know what we mean: one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one assistance&mdash;`or is there no point in putting you through that?' Everybody agrees. I have spoken to dozens of people in community organisations and there is an agreement that there are some people who would not benefit from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Margetts goes on and says, `So what happens then?' I think she said that what we are doing is putting them aside and making them `basket cases'&mdash;I understand that they are the words she used this morning. I  do not know whether she has not been keeping up with the program. But, as a consequence of the very wide negotiations this government has had since announcing this in May last year so that everyone would have a clear idea of what was what&mdash;we issued a broad outline of what we wanted to do and consulted widely on that&mdash;we worked with the community organisations. They agree that, for someone who has a drug problem, an alcohol problem, a mental health problem or some other problem that is stopping them from getting work, it is not fair to put them through some six months or 12 months of assistance when you know that, if that problem is not fixed, they are not going to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have developed the community support program. We are brokering people who will primarily be community providers to, in a sense, case manage these people. If you have a drug, alcohol or mental health problem, there is a fair chance that you do not know where to go to get the appropriate help; you do not know how much assistance is out there. So we have put up an $11 million program to pay community providers to help these people get the appropriate help and put them in a condition&mdash;that is, get rid of the drug, alcohol, mental health or whatever problem&mdash;so they can come back, have a capacity to benefit and have a real chance of getting a job. So, Senator Margetts, we might disagree on lots of things, but if you are going to drop a bucket on somebody's program, I ask you to at least have the decency to read the program properly before you do drop the bucket.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be opposing this amendment. I will take the opportunity to make a few remarks, a couple of which are procedural. Firstly, I want to indicate that the opposition amendments will be moved jointly with the Australian Democrats and, secondly, I want to indicate that the running sheet as distributed seems to indicate&mdash;and I think the minister's advisers are under this impression, which may be our fault
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4122"> due to lack of experience&mdash;that we were going to move our amendments 1 to 41 in toto. That is not the intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of issues and I am not sure where the numbers will fall on any of them. If I was confident enough that we would get them all through at once, Minister, I would be happy to move them in toto, but I suspect that is not the case. We will try to work out, in the next little while, appropriate  groupings of amendments to be moved together where we can deal with the one issue. I will consult with Senator Kernot about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect the first couple of amendments will occupy us for some time in any event so we will have time to look further down the list of amendments to work out what might be a better way to handle the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to indicate at the outset that the opposition has been concerned by reported comments of the minister to the effect that she would withdraw the bill if the opposition persisted or were successful with its amendments. I want it put on the record that we are most concerned with what appears to us to be somewhat of a threat in that regard. It is clearly not appropriate. The bills have been on the agenda for some time. We have been waiting to debate them and it is important that parliamentary debate does occur, not only for all the normal reasons of the important role that parliament should play in deciding such important policy issues, but also because people ought to be aware that this is particularly the case in relation to these bills because the government has no mandate for these changes&mdash;that point was made in the second reading debate. It is not a policy that has been taken to the people and endorsed. Quite the opposite is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party and the coalition went to the election promising to retain the CES, promising to retain the role of a public provider, and so one could say they misled the public in then seeking to bring this legislation before the parliament. So it is very important that when the minister wants to argue about doing things by regulation rather than by having the scrutiny of the parliament applied, that point is very firmly in peoples' minds&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">this is not a case where a government is frustrated implementing its policy which it took to the election; this is a government that is seeking to implement a policy that it developed after the election in response to, as I understand it, some sort of cabinet debate about the need for privatisation and for moving quickly on its privatisation agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make is that the reason we need to debate this bill very thoroughly is not purely for what is in the bill but for what the minister intends to do by administrative action on a range of measures that have been considered part of normal employment services in Australia. The minister has announced a range of measures which seek to reduce or remove traditional community service obligations provided by the government in the employment area. They are, in large part, not contained in this bill and it is important in my view that the parliament debate those issues; otherwise there will not be a proper public debate about those announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness to the minister those announcements were made in her statement following the last budget and so they are out in the public arena. But it is important that the parliament debate those issues. That is why the opposition has sought to address some of those issues via amendment to these bills&mdash;because these are important public policy issues that otherwise would not be considered by the parliament. They would not be debated here, and there would be no opportunity for us to make a decision about whether that direction, which, as I say, is not supported by any claim to mandate, should be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those reasons we think it is very important that these bills be debated. We are very concerned at the suggestion that the minister, if she does not get her way, would seek to do it by regulation. Our own legal advice is that that is not entirely possible; there is a range of difficulties with that, but obviously that is a judgment for her to make. We will be arguing the case that any changes made to the delivery of employment services ought to be approved by this parliament and we are keen to have that debate today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is entirely correct. The parliament should be determining a monumental change like this&mdash;the inherent privatisation program of the government is moving into the area of its responsibilities for the 800,000&hyphen;plus unemployed people in this country, in particular, the long&hyphen;term unemployed people. I was interested to see in that vote that the Labor Party and the Democrats voted with the government on the second reading vote for the Reform of Employment Services Bill 1996 with just we two Greens sitting on this side of the chamber opposed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I presume that there is an element of concern that the administrative route, the use of regulations, may, indeed, be taken as an option if the legislative option is not taken. I also expect the argument to be used that there is a large number of amendments to this legislation which will make a silk purse out of the sow's ear, but the reality is that this legislation should not be passed in the Senate. It is a privatisation agenda. It is against the interests of the unemployed people in this country. It does nothing to foster the growth of jobs, which is the ultimate answer to their problems; in fact, it will in significant but small measure lead to job losses from the government payroll and it is going to put many tens of thousands of people in an even worse situation than they are in now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said during the debate on the second reading that in May this year a quarter of a million people have been unemployed for 12 months or more. The government's privatisation program, according to the prescription of this bill, would help 78,000 already long&hyphen;term unemployed. A further 10,000 are to be forced onto the work for the dole scheme in regional areas where unemployment is at its worst, and they are young people, and 6,375 are participating in community support program placements. That leaves 151,600 long&hyphen;term unemployed people for whom no provision is made whatever. It will be interesting to hear what Senator Vanstone has to say on their behalf about this program, which she says is going to brighten up the hope trajectory of those people who are long&hyphen;term unemployed and who are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finding themselves even more abandoned with this move to privatise the reskilling and placement business, which ought to be the business of government but which is going to be put out to private for&hyphen;profit instrumentalities in increasing measure under this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about the date. I would like to ask the Minister (Senator Vanstone) some questions that go very much to the issue of what date is appropriate for bringing this scheme into operation. The exposure draft, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overview of the employment services request for tender</EMPHASIS> , was given to us at the last estimates. I do not want to go through all of this now, but I have just this question. If you take, for example, paragraph 1.4, the five services that are to be tendered for, the minister pointed out&mdash;and, indeed, she explained in ways that I thought were correct&mdash;that the aim of this scheme was to help the long&hyphen;term unemployed. You then went to the schemes that the Labor party had in operation when they were in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go to paragraph 1.4 of this tender document&mdash;and I understand that it is only an exposure one&mdash;it seems to paint a picture which is quite different from the one that has been painted so far by the government. It mentions the five services which are to be subjected to this tender. The first one is not about long&hyphen;term unemployed, but about the Labor exchange services. The next one is about job search assistance to train people in how to go around getting jobs. The third is employment assistance; then there is one about entry level training support services, and new enterprise incentive schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you read that document, you go down those five services that are to be tendered for and you say, `How are the long&hyphen;term unemployed to be looked after with those provisions?' There is just no way that you can get a purchase on how this scheme is going to work. If you look at paragraph 1.5, the key players in the new arrangements will be: DEETYA, the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, and organisations contracted to provide employment services. There is no
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4124"> mention of the unemployed, and certainly not of the long&hyphen;term unemployed, as being a key players in this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then look at the issue of tendering in 3.1 in paragraph 3 of the exposure draft. It is unclear whether people tender for a region, or whether any number of people can go to a region and hold themselves out to give services to the unemployed as long as they are approved of by the appropriate authorities. Paragraph 3.5 talks about the labour market regions, but is a tenderer to get the monopoly  in a region? Paragraph 1.2 talks about government reforms to employment and training services, but there seems to be nothing specific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have a date by which this scheme is to come into operation, and when you have an exposure draft such as this&mdash;and I know there are two other documents which I do not have with me because I have given one away at the moment&mdash;the message comes through that is a scheme that has not been thought through with the thoroughness that you would hope when tender documents are to be put out. You could do two things: consider putting the date off even further so that you can get the documents into appropriate shape, and, perhaps, if the documents are already in a good shape, make them available to the people who are part of this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the spirit of putting our cards on the table, I have simply wanted to say that these things are unacceptable; other things we can talk about. I have had, I think, some reasonably useful discussions with Senator Kernot. I do not think that we are going to get there,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but there are a number of things that I have pointed out where she has seen merit in what we have said and a number of things that she has raised that we have said we can look at. So it is not true that I am going to get my way or stamp my feet and march off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This much is true: if certain amendments are moved that have the effect of frustrating the government's clear intention in this, as opposed to improving the bill, then we will choose an alternative path. I think that it would be the wrong thing not to tell you that. If we had the debate and you made amendments willy&hyphen;nilly, only to find later when the bill was passed that we said, `I am sorry. That is unacceptable,' I am sure someone would say, `I wished you had told us that at the time because we wanted to push our luck as hard as we could, but not that far and now you are going to go this other way.' I feel a bit hard done by here. I have tried to be as open and frank with you as I possibly can be and I get portrayed as being some nasty woman who wants to threaten you. Anyway, I just wanted to put that in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans is right. We did not announce the plans for this at the time of the election because we did not have them. We did say that we would support CES. Let me just remind you, if you look at what we are doing, we are taking one part of the CES&mdash;and you have agreed to this&mdash;and we have already put part of that in with the shopfront of the Department of Social Security, so we do not have unemployed people running around blocks to suit bureaucrats. We have put that together, and the remaining part we are corporatising. That is not abolishing it; it is changing its form, yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we are determined to proceed in one way or another to improve the services to unemployed Australians. We have been good enough to say that we think your disastrous Working Nation program was put forward in good faith. At least give us the credit for having the same intention. We will put first in every unemployment queue&mdash;I will not say by hook or by crook because we will not do anything by crook, or by crooked means&mdash;unemployed Australians who are long&hyphen;term unemployed or are at risk of becoming long&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4125">term unemployed, who are on benefits and want to get jobs. I am absolutely determined about that. I will absolutely put them above people who have got jobs and want better ones, and even above people who have, sadly, been retrenched and have got big retrenchment payouts. I still say that if I have to help one or the other, I am going to help the long&hyphen;term unemployed person before I help the short&hyphen;term unemployed person who has got a big retrenchment payout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown made the point about profit being such a dirty word. He has not yet come  to grips with the fact that it is profit that generates income for the government which allows the government to pay out money and do good things. But the dawning of that, hopefully, will eventually come; Senator Brown is not a spring chicken, but it will eventually come to him, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could explain why I think that is an excellent motive. Why will the profit motive help the long&hyphen;term unemployed better than anything we have ever tried before? It is quite simply this: if you go into the CES now, as well&hyphen; intentioned as everybody there is&mdash;and I think they work very hard to do a pretty good job&mdash;you can strike someone on a bad hair day, as they say, or even someone who is right up and ready to go, but it does not mean a thing to that person's job. The person in the CES still has their job whether they get you one or not. So it does not matter. We can be poor performers, medium performers, excellent performers. Every week or fortnight we can put out our hand and take the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, for private and community providers that were contracted under the Working Nation program, they would do their best; I am sure they would do their best. But they get money for putting you on a training program. So when an unemployed person goes into one of these agencies, they may well feel like, and be seen as, someone who is down on their luck and it being a case of, `Aren't we all big Joes, we're going to try and do our best for them. Isn't that nice?' It is for you if you are the warm person with the nice feeling in your heart, `I'm going to try and do my best for you, but by the way I'll keep my job whatever happens,' but it is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not so good for the unemployed person, to feel as if they are on the receiving end of some charitable exercise of goodwill by the government and others. I do not think that is the appropriate position to put unemployed people in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the new system that we are proposing. That is one where all of these people get paid their money on whether they get you a job. So all of a sudden the unemployed person who comes in is not someone who is down on their luck, and it being a case of, `Oh, I'll try and help them if I can and I'll keep my job anyway, whether I get them a job or not.' All of a sudden the unemployed person is a very important person to every employment provider because the only way an employment provider will survive and get money from the Commonwealth is if they keep putting unemployed people into jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now the unemployed person, under the system I want to create, will be the most important person in every employment placement enterprise. Those people in those employment placement enterprises, whether it is the public provider, the private providers or the community providers, will not keep their jobs as employment providers if they do not provide employment. The profit motive is an excellent motive to get people to focus on what is important in their job, and that is getting other people jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney asked me briefly about the tender document that he has seen. I do not think we have yet got a copy of that, or we might have, but I have not had a chance to look. Senator Cooney referred to the five employment services identified and, as I gather, his point was that he was not too sure how it spelt out that the majority of people who would be helped would be the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wanted to indicate to him that the first four services that he mentioned will take about 10 per cent of the Commonwealth's money. I think I indicated&mdash;if I did not, I will now&mdash;that we are not walking away from all other employment services. There is the new enterprise incentives scheme, for example, which would come under self&hyphen;employment

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans says, `Oh well, it doesn't help the unemployed.' But if you are running a business and interest rates are at the lowest they have been in 24 years, you are a little more inclined to expand. When interest rates were high, as was the case under the previous government, at around 18 per cent, if you were a small business you did not look at expanding and taking anybody else on because you just plain could not afford it. So let us try to keep to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney, the remaining 90 per cent goes into the last program, intensive employment assistance, which, as I say, builds on case management&mdash;not exactly the same, but builds on it&mdash;and is different only in the respect that under the case management&mdash;which I freely identify is a creative part of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Working Nation&mdash;you may need one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one help. For instance, Senator Cooney, if you are unemployed and I am your case manager, it is very wise to recognise that you need one&hyphen; on&hyphen;one help, but then my hands were tied behind my back because I had to choose from a range of Commonwealth programs in which to help you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are changing that. Senator Cooney, we will say you are most likely to get a job, so there would not be much money attached to helping you, but there will be an amount of money attached to helping you&mdash;a bigger amount if you were more difficult to get employed and even bigger if you were very difficult get employed. That money would notionally come to me, if I were an employment provider. It would not actually come to me. I could use it as I saw fit to get you a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So instead of having to choose out of just some limited programs, with my hands tied behind my back, I could actually choose what you really needed, and if you needed a bit of one program and a bit of another, I could put together what you wanted. That is the way in which we are changing the case management system. Having recognised the one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one system as important, we are giving the case manager the flexibility to give the unemployed person what they need. But that is where 90 per cent of the money goes&mdash;to the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that the idea of the scheme is to contract out to providers the job of obtaining work for people. But it seems to me that that makes that contract very important in this whole scheme of things. If you actually look at the Reform of Employment Services Bill, the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act and the Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill itself, you see the idea of the scheme. It would seem to me that that scheme is very sketchily drawn, so that people in this chamber really do not have an idea of how this is all going to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand, by looking at the legislation, that the government has got some concerns about the providers of these services,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4127"> because they have made them subject to certain provisions in the Crimes Act, for example, which would normally be applicable only to a public servant, and we have them made applicable to the Ombudsman Act and to other provisions, which would indicate that there is some concern about how these services will be provided. Given that you have these restrictions put on to these potential service providers, it must mean that you do want to limit them&mdash;as a government should, and is entitled to do&mdash;in certain ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we cannot get from this side of the chamber, without some copy of a contract, is just how these services are going to be  provided. What rights, for example, does a person who is attending as a client of one of these providers have? Has he or she got to rely on the Ombudsman Act? Has he or she got to rely on going to the Employment Secretary? That seems to be the situation. If that is so, then that is a very clumsy way of doing it. It might well be that if we had the contract before us in this chamber, we might be able&mdash;as we are with the legislation&mdash;to make some useful contributions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of outcomes oriented legislation and Senator Vanstone's comments that officers of the CES have as their prime responsibility to get jobs for others, and that even when they do not get jobs for others they keep their own jobs, I think it is important to talk about other examples of that. Look at all the CEOs of huge companies who busily take decisions to downsize and get rid of thousands of their employees while keeping their own jobs, irrespective of performance outcomes, levels of profit and dividends. Look at the number of ministers who have presided, for example, over 18,000 public servants who in the past couple of years have been told they have no job. Yet we in parliament, who make these decisions, get to keep our jobs. Even though their specific purpose is to get jobs, I do not think it is fair just to focus on CES officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just have to say one thing: we cannot divorce this debate from the wider economic debate, because the most fundamental problem facing us is unemployment and this is part of your answer to unemployment. But I cannot sit here and let you assert that you can see all the benefits of 18 months of government, or whatever it is, because there are four interest rate cuts.

You say that we have put the ombudsman in there as if to imply that we think someone is going to do something wrong. That is not the case. But why shouldn't unemployed Australians have all the protections you can possibly provide? Why shouldn't they have them? I do not put them there for fear that someone will do something wrong, but because of a view that unemployed Australians are just as entitled to every  check and balance on government services as you provided in case management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot, you are quite right, I do not make that assertion about ministers&mdash;and I never have asserted that to you. I had to point out to you the other day where you were misinterpreting me and repeating your version of what I said and I caught you nicely at it&mdash;right between the goals. What I in fact said was that there would be plenty of amendments that would be acceptable, but there would be some that would not be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is completely inappropriate to exclude community providers like Centapak, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Salvation Army and private providers from labour exchange work. We simply have an attitude where we will give the money for labour exchange work to those who do the labour exchange effectively and it will be distributed around accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it would be quite inappropriate for that proposal to be overridden by an amendment, and we would not accept it. I say that in the spirit of trying to be respectful to parliament, rather than in a threatening way. It might be uncomfortable, in a political sense, for opponents of this change to realise that the government may be able to go another way. It would not be exactly the same. I understand that. We would have to go to some effort to redesign the program, but I have gone to some effort to design a program that has legislative change in it to give parliament the opportunity to endorse this reform.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4132"> is a very regrettable fact of life that neither you nor I, nor any business, nor the government, has unlimited funds. The government's funds come from people who have jobs and make money, either by earning a salary or making profits. Therefore, a very wide range of government programs are limited. There is not a big cash pool out there where we say, `Come and help yourself, if you would like it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I am going to answer your question. Sadly, that is the case with a very wide range of services. It is not an ideal world, and it is the case with employment services.

A long&hyphen;term unemployed person under Labor never had automatic access to what Labor referred to as case management. There was quite a long waiting list for case manage ment&mdash;confirming my view that long&hyphen;term unemployed people want to get a job and that, therefore, the long&hyphen;term unemployed on benefits should be put first.

I think that briefly is your proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not going to work like that. It simply is not going to work like that because the service delivery agency will be the one which refers unemployed people to an EPE or a PEPE, and the EPE or PEPE cannot refuse. You cannot have pick and choose. Someone with a blindfold and a mask over their head could see that, if you let private and community and even public providers choose whom they will look after, they will choose the easiest first. So I quite agree with you, if that is your sentiment. There will not be that choice. They cannot choose who comes in the door and they cannot have only the easy to place people; they will get a fair mix. So, at the end of the tender period, someone who followed the passage that you think they will&mdash;that is, ignored the harder cases&mdash;would not have a good outcome.

If you have had them for 12 months, and they get a job a month later, it is obviously to the benefit of unemployed people and providers if that is taken into account. The short answer is, it will be the existing system with some improvements.</PARA></SPEECH>

With the other path, the legislation is already there but it is more difficult in an administrative sense. I have indicated to you that there are some key aspects of the legislation which the government believes are essential to our reforms, and I have indicated that, if the government is of a view that we cannot proceed in that sense, we will have to go the other route. There is, additionally, a  time problem in terms of getting the process&mdash;3,000 people inquiring about tenders and an enormous amount of work to be done.

Let us hope not. So far as I am concerned, I am not wanting to delay this measure at all. In fact, this government amendment is extending the date of operation of the legislation from 1 December this year to 9 March next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked you a specific question: given the fact that every single member of parliament will be interested in the basis of this legislation and hopeful for its outcome, is the government prepared to give the opportunity to every member of the parliament, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, to debate the matter and to give the benefit to the government of their consideration of the matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to believe&mdash;I know some people do&mdash;that all wisdom resides in the Senate. Certainly some people consider that all wisdom resides in the government. But there is the House of Representatives. This measure has been introduced into this chamber. I hope I am wrong, but what the minister seems to be indicating is that, if this chamber moves amendments, the government would then consider scrapping the bill altogether, without giving the House of Representatives and all those brilliant people in the House of Representatives an opportunity to give full consideration to this matter. I do not think that is a fair crack of the whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there will be, no doubt, from the government in the House of Representatives considered views that will be down in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which a person like me will be able to take into account if and when the matter comes before this chamber again.

I hope we can get it over and done with this afternoon here so that the matter can go down to the House of Representatives, as this measure was introduced in this house.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By good sense of the Australian people, both the coalition parties have a very substantial majority down in that chamber and I can assure you they are all very much in favour of this bill. I can assure you that, in the event of a debate down there, the coalition members will be very strongly opposed to the amendments. This has been discussed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I just ask you to consider this. When the government was considering these reforms, had we chosen a different path to operate under existing legislation, as is available, you would have no complaint because
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government would be entitled to say, `We are the government and we are acting under existing legislation.' Irksome as it may be, the government can act under existing legislation.

That choice is there for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have indicated to you there are two aspects to this. Firstly, the government's intention is being frustrated. As I have told you, I intend to place the long-term unemployed who are on benefits at the top of every employment queue I possibly can and I am determined to do it. Secondly, I have indicated to you there is a timing problem. The government has not been irresponsible in this respect.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I thought the debate on this employment services bill might take some time. Having seen the debate that the government's largely perfunctory amendment took, it may well take a very great time. I too do not wish to delay the proper debate on this at all but, from the opposition's point of view, it seems that this amendment seeks to express in the objects clause an alternative model to the one proposed by the government. In that sense, I think it is an important amendment and one  which is a key to the sort of ideological debate that is occurring over this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment of ours seeks to replace a fairly small objects clause in the government's bill which talks mainly about mechanisms to deliver employment services and establishing a competitive market. The amendment which we have moved seeks to establish mechanisms to deliver employment services, but in a manner which will ensure that: all Australians have access to high quality labour exchange services; employment services provided to persons are based on the individual circumstances; employment services are provided in a fair, just and expeditious manner; employment services are provided in accordance with high ethical and professional standards; and, Australia's obligations under the ILO conventions are met. Of course, that is in so far as is consistent with those objectives to permit the establishment of a competitive market for the provision of employment services and, further, in so far as is consistent with those
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objectives to provide for flexibility in the forms of employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this seeks to provide the framework for our amendments to the bill in toto which seeks to replace the government's model, if you like, by retaining the commitment that we have had as a nation since 1946 to universal access to labour exchange services. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has, in her explanations to the chamber so far in the committee stage, sought to set up a straw man. She said that it is a choice of whom you help, that her commitment is to help the long&hyphen;term unemployed, that every public dollar will go to them. Of course, that is code for saying the public dollar will no longer go to 400,000 Australians who are currently eligible for assistance from the CES. It is code for taking services off other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read the second reading speech of the minister, you might struggle to find this measure because it was glossed over. The emphasis was all on the assistance to the long-term unemployed and their new competitive regime. The Labor opposition is saying that that is fine. Unlike the Greens, we did not oppose the second reading of this bill because we are not seeking to prevent the government setting up that competitive regime. Nothing in any of our amendments is intended to, or will, prevent the government establishing the competitive regime for the intensive employment assistance programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we will not be party to the removal of access to basic labour exchange services for all Australians, and that is what this bill seeks to do. By virtue of a decision announced by the minister not contained in the bill, and not given any emphasis in the second reading speech, those persons who are not `eligible persons', which is the new phrase, will not be entitled to any measures of assistance from the old CES or the new PEPE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Eligible persons' effectively means persons on unemployment benefits. Those who are not eligible for unemployment benefits are entitled to nothing from the CES or PEPE. What the minister has said is that those persons will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4140"> be left to fend for themselves. That is, those newly arrived migrants whom we now deny unemployment benefits to until they have finished their waiting period will not be able to access publicly funded labour exchange services in this country. Women seeking to re&hyphen;enter the work force or women who have a working spouse will be ineligible to access those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A whole range of people&mdash;those who are made redundant or are retrenched, who for income or asset test purposes are excluded from unemployment benefit or who are too old or too young or what have you&mdash;will no longer be able to go to their local CES or PEPE and get the advantage of labour exchange services. So this measure is largely about trying to ensure that we have a continuation of basic, universal access to labour exchange services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a radical measure. The minister, on this occasion, is the radical in the debate.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="VANSTONE" NAMEID="7E4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As ever. We are adopting largely the conservative position. This is the conservative ideology that I do not know that the minister is all that wedded to but it certainly seems to have the numbers in  cabinet these days. This is the decision to exclude people, to basically say to people, `If you are not receiving unemployment benefit, you are going to fall into the fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service regime.' Make no mistake: the cumulative effect of these amendments is to establish a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service regime for unemployed persons in this country who are not in receipt of benefits. That is the logical conclusion to the constructionist market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking in these amendments to ensure that the existing services and rights of Australians to have access to high quality labour exchange services are continued and protected. We are not seeking to give people rights or services they do not have currently; we are seeking to protect those basic rights&mdash;rights that are contained in our obligations under the ILO convention, rights that have been accepted on a bipartisan basis in this country since 1946, rights that have never
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been publicly argued against, except in the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government did not go to the last election arguing that these people should lose their rights to labour exchange services. This is a measure taken to punish those who are unemployed but not able to access unemployment benefits. What we seek to do in these amendments is protect those rights but also set up what we think are reasonable objectives for a piece of legislation like this. The rights are: to be treated in a fair, just and expeditious manner, to have high ethical and professional standards applied and to have assurance that the employment services provided to persons are based on their individual circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in keeping with the government's approach in terms of the competitive market, but we want to make sure that the objectives spell out very clearly that these are objectives of the legislation and that all the other measures in the bill have to be measured against those proper objectives for the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we do not seek to prevent the competition model being implemented in terms of the more intensive employment assistance measures; what we say though is that every Australian has a right to those basic labour exchange services. In doing so, we give voice to our ILO commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the minister is keen to indicate that people will have access to the service delivery agency&mdash;and they will&mdash;but I took the opportunity to revisit a CES the other day to absolutely confirm in my own mind what those services will be. They are defined in the minister's speech on the second reading and in the tender documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that people actually have a look at those, because the minister's defence has been that people will still be able to go to the Commonwealth service delivery agency and access services and that this somehow meets our ILO obligations. Well, anyone who reads the ILO convention and reads the government's  definition of the self&hyphen;help assistance will see quite clearly that it does not meet our ILO convention obligations at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4141">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition in the minister's speech on the second reading&mdash;and I think it is consistent with the tender documents&mdash;is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self help assistance will be available at the agency to all job seekers. It would include access to: job vacancy displays, other employment and training information and facilities such as computers and telephones.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, they can look at the displays, they can read pamphlets about education and training, and they can make a telephone call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what they do not get is basic labour exchange services, the basic labour exchange services that are guaranteed by the ILO convention and that have been provided by the CES for the last 50 years. The government is trying to have us believe that their self&hyphen;help facilities, which are so basic and will be available at the agency, somehow meet their obligations to 400,000 or so unemployed people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the ILO convention&mdash;and I will not take the time of the Senate by reading a great deal of it&mdash;describes in article 6 the sort of service that is required to be met as part of our commitment. That talks about things like the job matching the basic labour exchange services, as are defined in the government's own documentation as being labour exchange services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the government has not met its obligations under its proposal to provide labour exchange services to all persons. It seeks to ration further the dollars available to unemployed in Australia by removing 400,000 or so unemployed persons from eligibility to anything but looking at displays, taking pamphlets and making a telephone call. That is not the sort of commitment that this country should be making to those large numbers of unemployed persons. And our objects clause, as proposed, will set out very clearly that we as a parliament think that Australians ought to continue to enjoy access to basic assistance in seeking employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not some unreasonable request, as I have said before; this is seeking the maintenance of a service that we have decided as a community for the last 50 years ought to be available. To pretend to set up a straw man argument to say that the minister is really only interested in providing assistance for the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long&hyphen;term unemployed is a very cruel way of describing what is in fact walking away from large numbers of unemployed people and providing them with basic employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, and I will not expand at this point, the cumulative effect of the government's bill, if enacted, is to set up this private market. What it means is that those persons who are not eligible&mdash;as the minister describes them&mdash;and who are not in receipt of unemployment benefits will end up having to pay a fee to an EPE or a PEPE to be competitive in that market. If two people go to an EPE looking for work, the EPE&mdash;as the minister says is her intention&mdash;will only be interested in helping the one who comes with the fee. If two people walk in the door and one person is going to provide $250 for receiving assistance and the other is just a person looking for work, it is quite clear what the EPE will do. They will assist the one with the fee attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who are unemployed and not in receipt of assistance will have to pay to be competitive. If they do not match the $250, they are not in the market. The EPEs control the vacancies. They control who gets referred to an employer. The unemployed people are not dealing with the employer. They are dealing with an agency which has the right to decide whether or not they get referred to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are setting up is a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service regime which means unemployed people have to pay for the right to get an interview for a job. I do not think that is a development this parliament ought to endorse. As I said, our amendment to the objects clause is designed to set up a different model which allows the government to do what it says its bill is about but prevents it from removing the services that are currently available to the unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Evans, because the Democrats are jointly moving it with the Labor Party. I will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4142"> just add a couple of things to Senator Evans's comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the government can still argue universal access simply to the self-help facilities through the CSDA, and I expect the minister will argue that. But that does not, in our view, deal appropriately with the under&hyphen;employed, and I do not think we should leave the under&hyphen;employed out of our consideration here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have increasing casualisation of the work force. We have so many people in part&hyphen;time and casual work, not by choice but because it is all they can get. If the bill were to stand as it is, then people with working partners, part-time workers looking for more work, workers looking for alternative employment or students looking for part-time work&mdash;all people who are not in receipt of Department of Social Security allowances&mdash;would be excluded from access to anything but the most basic labour market assistance&mdash;as Senator Evans has outlined, looking at a touch screen and making a phone call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has argued that the government has only a certain amount of money to go around. That is because governments make choices about the balance between cutting expenditure and raising revenue. Even given that, you still have to ask yourself&mdash;given the state of employment in this country, with  under&hyphen;employment and casualisation and the vulnerability of all those in this kind of work&mdash;whether it is fair to exclude those people. I think it excludes them from decent opportunities we have always offered in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the objects in the amendment, No. (i) has regard to the universality and No. (ii) seeks to include others than those on unemployment benefits. But Senator Evans did not touch on No. (iv). The last part of No. (iv) is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the right of users of the services to privacy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an issue which is going to be debated at length as we go through the reform of the Public Service&mdash;that is, the whole notion of standards of privacy and accountability as things are contracted out to the private sector. We think the right of users of the service to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privacy should be included in the objects of this act. I think these replacement objects more appropriately reflect what we think should be the thrust of the bill&mdash;which is universal access. We do not want confined services, the most basic labour market assistance or just self-help facilities at the CSDA; we want proper and additional services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to briefly expand upon the point that Senator Kernot made about people who are under&hyphen;employed being denied assistance in this Reform of Employment Services Bill. Having represented people on low incomes in my previous role as a union official, I would have to say that, if you looked at the threshold level at which people will be denied access to labour exchange services under this bill, you would have to be concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures show that a couple with an income of $23,723 before tax would be denied access. That family could have a single salary earner or two part-time salary earners. If it was a single salary earner, the take-home pay would be about $366.50 a week, and I am sure those people would categorise themselves&mdash;and I think reasonably fairly&mdash;as the working poor. If they had the opportunity, I think they would be seeking to improve that level of income for the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do pay tax, and may well have for some time, but this bill will deny them what they are now entitled to, that is, the opportunity for assistance to get alternative or additional employment so that they can meet their obligations and have a reasonable lifestyle. There is an unfairness in the proposition that these people be excluded from rights which they now have. It is absolutely incredible that the government is suggesting that one or both in the couple ought to be excluded from access to services which would assist them in seeking to find alternative or additional employment which might improve their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the issue of compliance with ILO convention 88. To me it is rather a long bow to suggest that the CSDA would provide services which comply with article 6. Because
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4143"> that is the only public sector body that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) proposes to establish, and having established it under other legislation but not establishing the PEPE under this legislation as a public sector body, the only organisation that anyone could look to to see whether the government was meeting its obligations under ILO convention 88 would be the PEPE. Article 9 says that the staff of the employment service shall be composed of public officials, et cetera. So it can be only the CSDA that purports to meet that test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the department has said that it believes that it does meet that test. It says that they comply with the object. I guess we can take from that that, if they say they are complying with it, they do not really have an objection to it. On the other hand, if they do not comply with it, I suppose they are going to have a problem in respect of whether or not it is an object that would have potential for challenge. We think it is much better policy that the reference to the convention be contained in the objects because, in our view, that is a test which has to be transparently met in relation to the performance of this legislation. As I have said, looking at article 6 and the tests set down in article 6 for compliance, I think we would find this legislation wanting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note how and why we developed the Commonwealth Employment Service in our previous commitment to ILO convention 88. After the Depression of the 1930s and the mass unemployment of that time, the government felt that they had an obligation to ensure that such unemployment would never be repeated. The CES was established in 1946 with the agenda of striving for full employment. To meet that end, a network of CES offices was established all over Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of a free employment exchange was so important then that, in 1949, member nations of the ILO, following the Declaration of Philadelphia, which established the ILO, set full employment as an objective for all nations. Australia was committed to free employment service for all Australians irrespective of where you live.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To revert and say that the service delivery agency is meeting the tests of that convention is a statement which cannot in any sense be borne out having regard to the convention itself or the set of conditions that had been laid down in the service delivery agency bill and which will be established by this bill. It is important that the objects of the act reflect the appropriate public policy for this area. For that reason, I think we should support the amendment proposed by Senator Evans.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to Senator Harradine that there is no suggestion in my amendment to the employment services bill which limits things in any way. It is an intention to provide an object which says that, where employment services are provided, they are provided in a fair, just and expeditious manner. It was inserted with a view to providing objects for the provision of services in the new employment market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are attempting to do in the objects clause is to set out some standards and objectives which will need to be applied. It certainly is not the intention, nor is it the effect, to regulate how decisions are made about who receives employment assistance. Provided the services were provided in that manner, the amendment was designed to set out, as with the others, a view of what we regard as being

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly not intended to interfere in the decision as to which clients would be assisted for which services. I am not sure that it could be seen in that way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with my response generally to what people have said. Yes, it is true that we want to very severely constrain the spending of Commonwealth moneys other than for people who are  long&hyphen;term unemployed or who are at risk of becoming long&hyphen;term unemployed. That is our intention. Yes, we do say that people who are on long&hyphen;term unemployment benefits will have first call on labour exchange money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator O'Brien. There are significant hidden and underemployed people in Australia, as there probably are in any economy. They are hidden in the sense that people have stopped looking for work and they drop out of the labour force. They do not identify themselves as looking for work, but when things pick up they come back in. The underemployed people are working part time or shorter hours than they would want to. You are right; EPEs&mdash;employment placement enterprises&mdash;would not be paid by the Commonwealth for assisting those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I explain to you why it was wrong? It was wrong for Martin Ferguson, the former president of the ACTU, to say last night, and it was equally wrong&mdash;and I would say more wrong&mdash;for Mr Beazley to say today that people will have to put their hands in their pockets to pay for employment services. It is wrong for two reasons. You might have raised the question of about to be made redundant workers in Newcastle, but certainly in New South Wales&mdash;and in South Australia where there is significant concern about National Rail&mdash;it is against the state law to charge an employee for employee placement services, and it has been for a significant period of time. In those states where it is not against the law, it is my understanding that there is a code of practice for private providers which prevents that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I will explain to you how these EPEs are going to work. If I wanted to set myself up as an employment placement enterprise&mdash;or as an arm of the public one, a PEPE&mdash;and I wanted to be successful, I would want to get as many unemployed people who are on benefits into jobs as I could because then the Commonwealth will pay me money. I want to get them into jobs. How am I going to do that? If I put out a sign to industry that says, `Come to me. I've got a lot of unemployed people. If you want one, come to me because I have got the best range of them possible', I suspect that I would be a complete failure. In fact, I would bet you London to a brick that I would be a complete failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand I recognise that to be successful I have to make industry links and that industry has to say, `Ring that Vanstone woman. She'll have someone for this particular job', whether it is a job in engineering, cleaning or whatever&mdash;the full range of activities. They may ring me up and want an engineer, but I have not got one. If I am the other fellow down the road who is behaving stupidly and only has unemployed people on benefits on my books and I do not have an engineer, then I am cooked. But if I have a wide range of people on my books&mdash;because I know that human resources is my business and that is what is important to the industry
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4145"> that I am dealing with&mdash;and they want an engineer, then I had better be able to give them one. If I have not got an unemployed engineer on benefits, I will give them one who wants more work or who is not on the benefit for some other reason. I will give them that first. But if I have an unemployed person on a benefit who is an engineer and I have others&mdash;someone underemployed, as you mentioned&mdash;then who am I going to pick first? The unemployed person on the benefit. That is what I mean by saying that we want to put them first in the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to survive the EPEs will undoubtedly need to have a very broad range of people on their books. They will get payment from the Commonwealth for some and presumably they will get payment from industry for others. They may well say to industry&mdash;and I probably would if I was an employment placement provider&mdash;`Look, I haven't got someone who is on benefit as an engineer, but I've got another bloke who will fit your needs', or it could be a female these days because there are so many women engineers. If every time that industry rings up I comply with their needs, I give them what they need and I am a useful employment placement enterprise for them, they will keep using me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I offer them an unemployed person and say, `This person matches what you need', they will take him or her because I will have built up a trust with them and they will  know that I will give them the people they need. So my best chance of getting more money from the Commonwealth is by giving industry what it needs. That will also mean that, as an employment placement provider, when I have a choice between sending along someone who has a job but would like more hours, and sending along someone who has not got a job but who wants one, I will send along the person who has not got a job and wants one. That is why I am so very pleased with this scheme, because it will put unemployed people on benefits first in the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, in answer to Senator Harradine's question, I understand that it was not possible to include that as a characteristic when the case management services were set up and we have not included it as one. I have some
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sympathy with the prospect of looking at the conditions that a person might find themselves in if others are dependent on them, but I can see some difficulties associated with that. The short answer is that at the moment it is not a part of the government's plan. What would be looked at are the circumstances and the length of their unemployment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I confirm for Senator Harradine that I have checked and the clause he was referring to, subclause 3, was inserted in response to evidence at the community services committee inquiry where a number of groups like ACROD and other community based and religiously based service providers indicated that they had concerns to ensure that the new market provided some sort of protection for clients. And we have a range of amendments that go to that later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really putting into the objects clause that they be treated in a fair, just and expeditious manner. We are trying to put some principles behind how the market will operate for the protection of clients, because clearly they will not just be dealing with Public Service departments subject to the normal accountability measures that apply to Public Service authorities. They will be dealing with private companies set up to make profit. So it was thought important that the objects clause include that statement as part of the attempt to ensure those sorts of standards and values were applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the particular person being assisted, I guess my major point in relation to this amendment and the government's approach is to say that the government applies one rule when it comes to whether they are going to provide you with any assistance, be you single, with dependents or whatever&mdash;that is, are you registered for unemployment benefits? If you are not registered for unemployment benefits, you are on your own. You receive nothing from the government other than the equivalent of this slip of paper which comes out of their computer system at the agency, which will give you the address of the EPE to go and talk to about whether or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4146"> not they will refer you to a job. That is all you will get from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that there is a range of people who will not be registered for unemployment benefits, but who genuinely need assistance&mdash;who have dependents, who have responsibilities, who have needs that ought to be met by our community. The community should assist those unemployed people to be matched with vacancies to find work. That is what we seek to do. We do not seek to discriminate purely on the basis of whether you are entitled to unemployment benefits or not. We say that, if you need a job, then we ought to be providing some service to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister makes the point that she wants to ration services even further because of the costs involved. I just think that the costs to the community of having 400,000 people out there without assistance, without community support for finding jobs, is a cost that we should not pay and that they should not be forced to pay, and it is a basic community service obligation to assist those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other thing that I wanted to mention is that the minister seems to have taken issue with Mr Ferguson and, I gather now Mr Beazley, on this question of putting one's hand in one's pocket for a job. I just wanted to briefly say that the support for our proposition that people will have to pay EPEs to gain access to their services if they are not eligible job seekers&mdash;that is, not registered for unemployment&mdash;is taken directly from the  minister's second reading speech where she gave credence to that by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation, EPES could not charge participants for providing them with employment assistance. This does not preclude EPES from charging non&hyphen;participants for similar services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, yes, they cannot charge eligible job seekers because the government is paying for them, but they can charge those not receiving benefits. In other words, she anticipates that the EPEs will have to charge those not receiving government support in order to get access to the same services, because she is creating this private market. I conclude her quote with the next line&mdash;I am not attempting to misquote her&mdash;where she says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may provide an additional revenue source for EPES.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She clearly envisages setting up a market where the EPEs receive payment from the government for those who are receiving support as eligible job seekers, and receiving finance from other job seekers who will have to put their hands in their pockets to compete. And, quite frankly, no&hyphen;one believes that an EPE who has two or three different clients will refer the client who is not paying the money to an employer for an interview or job. Clearly, if the EPE is going to receive a minimum of $250 for referring one client and nothing for referring another client, they will refer the client who gives them the cash return&mdash;the very profit motive that the minister has extolled in the last hour or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, those who are not in receipt of government support will either basically get no support and have no chance of getting a job, or will have to put their hand in their pocket to get a job. It is a fee for service regime that has been established&mdash;make no mistake. You will have to pay for the privilege of an EPE referring you to an employer because the EPEs control the job. The new agency will not control the job. They will give you a slip of paper that says, `Here is the address of the EPE; go talk to them.' It is not a one&hyphen;stop shop at all; it is at least a two&hyphen;stop shop. The agency gives you the bit of paper. It says, `This EPE has a job'&mdash;the one I have got here is a hairdresser&mdash;but all you will get is the address of the EPE. It will be a closed vacancy because that is how they will make their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will refer you to that EPE and the EPE will say to you, `That is very nice. Are you on any government assistance for seeking a job?' If you say no, I suspect they will show you their fee for maybe helping you with your CV or anything else. The minister refers to state legislation barring charging in a couple of states. That, I think, is putting the argument too strongly from my quick look at the legislation today but, in any event, that is not something controlled by us. What this legislation does&mdash;and the minister set this out in her second reading speech&mdash;is give us a regime where you pay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to expand on what Senator Evans was saying with regard to some of the points raised by Senator Harradine, who is now not here, unfortunately. This legislation means that a casual school cleaner, for example, who has two or three kids and a non-working spouse and wants to become a full-time cleaner or access a full-time job will not be able to get free access to the labour exchange services. That is what this legislation means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) acknowledges the increasing underclass of underemployed people and also those people who are stuck in poverty traps&mdash;and `poverty' is a word that is not used very much these days. The underemployed and those not getting sufficient income will not be able to access the same range of services that they do now. It is as simple as that, and that is the problem. That is why we have moved this amendment with regard to the objects of the act: to make sure that they do. We do not want underclasses in Australia. We do not want people who are on low wages ghettoised in those low wages; we do not want entrenched and systemic poverty traps existing in our country. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make&mdash;again, it is a pity Senator Harradine is not here; I might restate this point later when he returns&mdash;is that during some recent DEETYA  Senate estimates hearings some Tasmanian senators sought a guarantee with regard to services by EPEs and PEPEs in Tasmania&mdash;it is a matter of great interest to you as well, Mr Temporary Chairman&mdash;because Tasmania is, first, the only island state; second, the most ruralised and disparate state in Australia; third, has the highest unemployment rate; and, fourth, has the highest youth unemployment rate. We sought a guarantee that services would be provided in the state, particularly where there are ghettos and pockets of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could not get that guarantee from the department. We tried and tried assiduously to get that guarantee. What we were told, and the minister may like to comment on this, is,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `We have a broad range of expressions of interest with regard to the EPEs and I can assure you, Senator, yes, there'll be no problem. There will be access to EPEs in Tasmania, particularly the areas of high unemployment.' Tasmanian senators are all too familiar with those areas. No commitment was given with regard to PEPEs. No commitment was given that, where there were no EPEs for whatever reason, a PEPE would be there to provide the service. No guarantee was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to find out whether the minister is now prepared to give that guarantee because the problem with this legislation as it is currently constituted is that it does not provide a guarantee for regional Australia, it does not provide a guarantee for those areas of high unemployment and it does not provide a guarantee of services for those people who are attempting to better themselves in terms of income&mdash;those with dependants who want the choice that this government talks about in relation to changing employment or moving from casual employment to full-time or even part-time employment as an improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, I would be interested to see whether the minister can indicate that guarantee&mdash;and, even if she can, the only way we can be sure about it is to actually put the guarantee in the objects of the act.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would put them ahead of someone who has a job and wants more hours, someone who has been out of work just for a while and someone who has a big redundancy payment and would like  to shift quickly into another job. Our highest priority in this nation must be the long-term unemployed who are on benefits. They deserve our highest attention, and from this government they are going to get it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say&mdash;and I have the second reading speech here&mdash;nothing has changed in relation to employment placement enterprises. If an underemployed person walks into Drake Personnel to get some advice on how they can get some more work, Drake Personnel will talk to them about vocational guidance and charge them for a vocational guidance interview. If someone wants some help from Drake Personnel in preparing a resume, it will probably charge them for that too. It will do
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a couple of interviews and put them in the right place but, if that organisation then puts them into a job, it will charge the employer for that job. That is what happens now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It takes a lot to take my breath away, but I have to say that when I see someone come in here and argue against the situation which has existed under the government that their party has been a part of for 13 years, I think, `Heavens, what's going on here?' This has been what has been happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional point needs to be made, and that is Senator Mackay wants an assurance, from what I can gather, that there will be a PEPE, a public employment placement enterprise, on every corner.</PARA>

I take that responsibility very seriously. I got no information from your department at all in relation to what services there would be in the state with the highest unemployment rate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just get some advice so that I can give the senator an answer with which she will be happy. In this respect Tasmania will be treated no differently. I know Tasmanian senators take their roles seriously. I sometimes think they think that other senators do not, but of course we do. We each represent a state. There is nothing particular about that; it is true of everybody here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania will be treated no differently from any other region. Tenders will be sought, people will put in their tenders and the successful tenderers will be announced. It is our job to ensure that there is adequate coverage. I cannot say who is going to be successful. People can tender for a whole region or part of a region to supply all the services or only services they want to provide. We would have to look at what the market offered to see who we would award tenders to and for what.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I can assure you that there will be better services around Australia, and that includes Tasmania, because there is a community service obligation on the PEPE and it can be subject to ministerial direction. So, were there to be a situation where neither the PEPE nor any private or community provider put a tender in where services were needed and they were therefore required, we would shift first to a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service tender and, if that were not success, instruct the PEPE to provide the services, for which they would be paid at cost.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4150"> But it is a very serious problem down there. It is the most disadvantaged state in Australia in any sort of variable that you can look at. Senator Watson knows this. In any variable that you look at, you see that we have got a serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be proper for Tasmanian senators to actually come in here and not argue the way that we are arguing and not seek this sort of guarantee. We want a guarantee for our constituents and for the state with the highest unemployment rate.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Having moved these amendments, I indicate that, as part of its attempt to insert some clearer definition of what is occurring and to outline some of the changes that are occurring and that are not covered in the bill currently, the opposition and the Democrats have sought to include some amendments that help in building that picture. I am not sure what the attitude of the minister is but we, for instance, are seeking to include a definition of the advisory committee. The government's and the opposition's amendments seek to establish an advisory committee&mdash;we might argue about its membership but hopefully we might even agree on that later rather than have a debate on it. I do not think that we are at odds in terms of the role that it is going to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important of these amendments is probably the definition of employment services. The government's definition of employment services is a very limited one&mdash;I would be interested to hear the minister's explanation of that. Our amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">employment services</EMPHASIS>  means unemployment benefits (within the meaning of paragraph 51 . . . ) of the Constitution . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We seek to pick up the regime that the minister has outlined in her speeches and tender documents which actually spell out the forms of employment services that are envisaged to operate in this regime. We do not seek to limit it. Our amendment seeks to say that the definition `includes, but is not limited to' in the event of developments or other options that are being pursued. We think, given that the minister is moving to this new competitive market, that we ought to spell out in the legislation what sorts of services are going to be provided in that market and what sorts of services are going to be tendered for, so that there is a transparency about that process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4152">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if they are not exactly the same as the definitions contained in the minister's departmental tender documents, they were certainly intended to be of a similar nature. We are not looking to argue about the definition. We are really seeking just to define those services. We also define the ILO convention and labour exchange services because we use that term fairly frequently, in terms of our approach to the bill and our amendments, so we thought it was important that it was defined. We also seek to define labour market programs because, as I understand it, the Commonwealth is still continuing some labour market programs. We are trying to give effect to the definitions of the sorts of employment services that are being considered by this bill. We think that gives us a more complete bill, one that is more transparent and makes for better legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to indicate that, if there is some prospect of agreement and if the minister wants to seek further advice, I would be happy to delay moving the amendments rather than our coming to an unnecessary debate or a less than adequate outcome. I indicate to the minister that, if we can reach agreement on these, we would be anxious to do so. If not, we will debate the matter. I was hoping that the minister would be able to find these amendments acceptable. They are not seeking to do anything other than to give some transparency and to give the same sorts of definitions as are contained in all the documenta tion produced by the department and which are the subject of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

You think the catch&hyphen;all phrase `but is not limited to' leaves you with the full openness of the earlier definition. I am advised that that is not the case&mdash;that, by adding in specifics, you run the very serious risk of reading down the degree to which you want to use the very broad power under subsection (xxiiiA) of section 51 of the constitution, and that `but is not limited to' would then be read as being that you could provide other services but only in the nature of the ones you had listed. In other words, by including the specifics, you read down the generality of the full opportunity there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, frankly, you do not gain anything by including the specifics, because you have graciously included the ones we have told you we are going to put in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to update the Senate on the situation in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley following the announcement by BHP to downsize the steel industry in that area. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) met yesterday with the unions and a large group of workers from BHP in Canberra, where there was a very interesting exchange of views on the future of BHP in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley. The Prime Minister did find the whole experience very informative. The members of the unions and the workers did put forward in a very frank and very illuminating way some of the economic and social effects of the downsizing of BHP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to correct an impression left by Peter Morris in the other place yesterday, and reported this morning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, about one aspect of that meeting which considered the future of the steel industry in the Hunter Valley. I must emphasise that the industry is staying in the Hunter Valley in the form of rolling steel products but not smelting steel. There will still be a steel industry in the Hunter Valley after the year 2000 but, of course, obviously of a much  smaller size. In terms of the options for the future, Peter Morris, the member for Shortland, has put up the option of another company buying the plant. There has been another view put round that there should be a worker buy&hyphen;out. I just want to speak briefly on those two options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister did express support for the fact that, if another company was prepared to buy the steelworks as an ongoing concern, he would support that. Indeed, I think both sides of the chamber would support that. I believe that about four years ago there was a prospective buyer for the steelworks in Newcastle. That prospective buy&hyphen;out actually fell
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through at that time. But, if a company from overseas or an Australian company came along and wanted to buy that steelworks as a going concern, I am sure we would all support it. What I would like to point out to the Senate, though, is that we should not get our hopes too high on that option. The probability of that happening, given the state of technology of that plant and given what is happening in world steel making at the moment, it is highly unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is a particularly dangerous option, given what I have just said about the state of technology and the state of the world market, is suggesting to workers that they participate in a worker buy&hyphen;out. In a number of industries such an approach has worked and it has worked very successfully. There has been at least one case overseas in the steel industry where it has actually worked. But what people should realise is the run&hyphen;down in technology in the Newcastle plant, which has been running down over the last 25 years. If it was going to stay in Newcastle, BHP really should have built a very large new blast furnace in about 1972. They made the decision not to do that and, even despite Labor's steel plan, the net effect of that has been to patch up a very ageing steel plant whose technology has been passed by by new developments in steel making worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would happen if there was a worker buy&hyphen;out is that people would be left with a plant which in a very short period of time would need a very major injection of capital. What BHP has done in its investment decisions with the Newcastle plant in recent years has been to inject enough capital to keep it running as an integrated steel mill until about the year 2000. Beyond that point, even if BHP stayed, it would need an absolutely major capital injection involving hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and people who got involved in such an arrangement could find that they would quickly lose their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of options put forward. Both of the options that the Labor Party seem to be following&mdash;either a worker buy&hyphen;out or someone else buying it&mdash;seem
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4155"> highly unlikely. It just amazes me that they continue with this backward looking approach. What we need in the Hunter Valley is a forward looking approach. As the region goes through a structural shift with the downsizing of BHP, we actually need to appreciate the social problems that that is going to cause, monitor that and actually respond in an appropriate way as a federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I was delighted yesterday when the Prime Minister announced the setting up of a high level prime ministerial task force to monitor this. He agreed to that with the union representatives yesterday. The task force will consist entirely of Hunter Valley people, who will be able to feed back directly to him the social ramifications of what is happening as time goes on, and then the government can respond appropriately to those problems. The federal government has already started to respond in an appropriate way to the economic situation created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been examining a number of projects which will assist in the transformation of the work force and industry in the Hunter Valley. The Hunter Valley has a very bright future in a number of areas, but what is needed is a number of programs and certain infrastructure to help bring this about. Probably one of the brightest futures for the Hunter is in the area of tourism. Perhaps more than any other area of Australia it has a combination of natural and heritage assets that makes it an incredibly attractive tourist destination right on the doorstep of the largest city and major airport in Australia. That  development will provide quite a lot of labour intensive jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very bright future for the Hunter involves defence and defence related industry work. There is a large  base which we would like to see develop into a super&hyphen;base for the air force. There are army facilities up there and increasingly naval work is starting to move to that area. It has a real potential not only for defence but for defence related contracts. This would help the Hunter move from the smokestack age that we have passed into a high&hyphen;tech future which creates real jobs; which creates high technology jobs; and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which creates, through industries like tourism, labour intensive employment. It is that future that we have to look forward to, not back to the smokestack age, as the ALP would like us to do.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4155"><TITLE>Media Coverage of Women's Sport</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week I was pleased to be able to attend the launch of a report by Dr Murray Phillips entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An illusionary image: a report on the media coverage and portrayal of women's sport in Australia 1996</EMPHASIS> . It was launched by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, and the report highlights the fact that coverage and promotion of women's sport in Australia is still unacceptably low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw a brief picture for this chamber of why this ridiculous anomaly continues to exist. It is an anomaly because this country has a long and proud sporting history but, unfortunately, part of this history has generally been excluded and the strengths, abilities and achievements of half the population have not been recorded with due diligence. In her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half the Race</EMPHASIS>, Marion Stell comments that `Australian women's success in international sport has been nothing short of astonishing when you consider the encouragement, resources, facilities and sponsorship directed elsewhere.' This is a very positive way of summarising what has been a very disturbing trend in Australian sport.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shirley Strickland epitomises the struggle that Australian women who have excelled in sport have faced. Strickland, as a 23&hyphen;year&hyphen;old nuclear physicist, struggled to overcome public criticism about her skills and, later in her career, her age. She was a woman who won eight Olympic gold medals and paved the way for the international reputation Australian sports people now enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strickland and the countless other women who have participated in international sporting events have also contributed to this reputation, but they have not, in my eyes, been given due recognition. For Australian women, sport has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4156"> always been an all&hyphen;encompassing activity. By 1940, there were over one million women who belonged to a registered sporting association. The great thing about these sporting groups was that they were not restricted to any age group or social class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sport since colonisation of Australia has reflected societal prejudices and discrimination, but it has also provided an important medium for binding women of all ages and social status together. It has at times been a positive reminder of the strength of unity and the importance of advancing the women's movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1920s, the added complexity of businesses becoming interested in women's sport emerged. Some motivation was based on physical fitness being correlated with more efficient workers. So women who had been in processing plants or standing on their feet all day were encouraged by their respective employers to take up hockey, lacrosse or athletics to strengthen their leg muscles. Badminton, table tennis, cricket and tennis were recommended for women working in factories to improve their hand&hyphen;eye coordination and, consequently, their output levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many would argue that the shift from ladies being steered away from exercising due to the impropriety of it all would be a great thing for women. However, as many women have said, the shift had more to do with other people's agendas than their own. The emergence in the 1960s of television excluded women from the portrayal of sporting lifestyles that they had been inundated with, and so the catch&hyphen;22 for women's sport was born&mdash; women needed sponsorship to get television coverage and advertising, but advertising companies would not give sponsorship without television coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem has continued to date with sponsors and companies requiring input into promotional aspects of their sport and uniform design. With so few women holding senior positions in large companies&mdash;and I think the current figure for women holding positions on corporate boards is, in fact, only three per cent&mdash;combined with only 21 per cent of executive directors of sporting organisations being women, the problem of fair and equi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> table participation of women in the sporting arena does become just a bit more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does this mean for the new generation of female athletes? The report by Dr Phillips indicates that, if they watch TV or listen to the radio, they will rarely&mdash;only two per cent of the total air time&mdash;see or hear about women achieving in sports. What young women do see and hear a lot about is men participating in great sports such as rugby league, golf, soccer, cricket, rugby union, et cetera. Some of these sports have women's teams or competitors and, certainly, a lot of fans, but few women get a look in with respect to this coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else do women see in the sports arena? They see very few female coaches. Recent statistics show that only 29 per cent of level 1 coaches are women and 17 per cent and 11 per cent are level 2 and level 3 coaches respectively. Here in Canberra, only two of the 24 head coaches are women&mdash;that is, eight per cent&mdash;and nine out of the 54 other coaches are women. This is cause for concern because the report highlights a very interesting point. That is, out of all the factors that contribute to what inspires women to contri&hyphen;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4157">
<PARA STYLE="Para">bute in sport, to stick with a sport and to achieve in a sport, one is the attitude of their coach and their relationship with their coach who is leading them through the sport and encouraging them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the minister for sport expressed his surprise at this low coverage level of women's sport, but I do not think you really have to look too far beyond some of the weekend sporting shows to see that this is in fact a reality. I am hoping that, arising out of this report, we will see some active campaigning on behalf of the government to rectify this problem. It is a tough one because it is not just about berating the media and saying, `Cover more women's sport,' but about improving women's involvement right through all the levels in sports administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media do have a significant role to play and do need to take some responsibility for what is going on, but I think the government can also do a lot to encourage them in this direction. This report is an important step in, once again, highlighting this problem, and it was certainly initiated in a formal report when Senator Rosemary Crowley was involved and initiated this program in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the time has come for the Australian public, advertisers, companies, sporting bodies and all media to recognise the strengths and abilities of women's sport in this country and the fact that people do actually want to watch it. If they extended themselves and perhaps experimented with greater coverage of women's sport in prime time television or radio slots, they would be very surprised at the high degree of support that they would get back from the Australian community in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="4.00 p.m." PAGE="4157"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 4.00 p.m.</EMPHASIS>
