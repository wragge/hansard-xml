<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, did you receive from DEETYA advice about the data you used to make comparisons between public and private schools on the basis of employment outcomes? If so, what was the nature of the advice? Were your comments that public school leavers are 10 times more likely to be unemployed than their private school counterparts based, as your spokesperson indicated, on ABS data? Is it correct, Minister, that this ABS data was unpublished and, if so, what cautions were associated with its use?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. Minister, the coalition government has found that the taxation system is in urgent need of reform and is inappropriate to Australia's needs as we move towards the 20th century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now tackling tax reform&mdash;that area that all have agreed for so long is in need of reform but governments have not had the courage to tackle. This government has the courage. What has happened is that the Prime Minister has instructed the taxation task force to prepare options in accordance with key criteria. The criteria&mdash;and it is important to emphasis this to the Australian public&mdash;include the following: the overall tax burden must not be increased. Contrast that with Gareth Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. He wants to put back death duties. He wants to see state income taxes.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, now 14 years later, it has taken a federal coalition government to progress an agreement with the Northern Territory and South Australian governments to pledge $300 million to develop this important rail link. Minister, what is the significance of the rail link to the nation as a whole? How many jobs will be created during the construction and operation period?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it has taken 14 years to get there and it is only a coalition government that can deliver the goods. The fact is that many people have talked about this project, many people have seen the potential for it, but it has only been the coalition government that has been prepared to grasp the nettle. What we would expect is that it will provide a brand new pathway for freight to travel through a new Asian gateway and create enormous opportunities to open up the bulk of the country in a way that has not happened before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what the Wran report had to say back in 1995 you will see that it predicted that the railway would become economic early next century. It clearly does involve a significant level of private sector involvement. We have made it very clear that the private sector must build, own and operate this line. The predictions are that during the construction phase there will be in the order of 2,000 jobs and during the operation stage there will be at least 200 jobs, a very significant contri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5665"> bution to employment but, much more importantly, a very major contribution to the opening up of the centre of Australia and to making sure that the southern states have access to the north in a way that they have not had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly significant about this commitment is that Labor pretends that somehow it is on the bandwagon, that somehow it would like to go out there and say that it would have done even more. As Senator Ferguson quite rightly pointed out, you have to go back to 1983 to come across the original weasel words. I suspect what Hawke was doing at the time was having a bit of a dry run for the l-a-w, law, tax cuts repeal because, having given that solemn promise, what did he do? Within a matter of weeks, he reneged. They said it was not on and they would not proceed with the rail link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an outcry and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, committed the government to spending $5 million on design work. They completed that, and by 28 March 1984 you had the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, describing the railway as totally unrealistic and uneconomic. That is basically where it has been ever since as far as Labor is concerned. We then had Senator Walsh getting up in here and calling it another bout of cargo cultism and saying that it was a waste of $160 million worth of taxpayers' money on a white elephant&mdash;all those sorts of expressions that made it absolutely clear that they had no intention of going down this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Senator Bob Collins on several occasions made it abundantly clear that he had the same approach as the opposition&mdash;unless and until the private sector committed, they were not interested. That is why it is the absolute height of hypocrisy to find that Senator Collins&mdash;and I see he is back in the Territory campaigning, presumably using federal taxpayers' funds, in a Territory election&mdash;has finally thrown in the towel. And we know why he threw in the towel&mdash;because Kim Beazley, in his usual burst of leadership, removed one of his additional staffers from him and he said he just was not prepared to hack it any longer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that shows up is the absolute barrenness of the Labor Party frontbench which cannot even find anyone to replace a person of the calibre of Senator Collins. Here you have Senator Collins saying, `The Hawke government offered a 60:40 deal with the Northern Territory government and that figure would mean $600 million in today's dollars.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely extraordinary that this outfit thinks that they can persuade people that something they could not get around to doing for 14 years, something that was not only too hard but something that they bagged on a regular basis, is now not only their policy but something on which they would have spent hundreds of millions of dollars more than we are committing to this project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Madam President. In the brief provided by the immigration minister, I do not have an indication of a change there, but I do recall a change being made last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, it is a traditional problem for what you would call seasonal picking work. There is enormous difficulty in getting the appropriate labour force. For a variety of reasons, that is not always attractive to people who are looking for work. If you are a young unemployed teenager in Melbourne, it might be of assistance for you to get some short&hyphen;term work picking grapes in Victoria somewhere for a limited period of time, but perhaps you are more likely to be looking for a more permanent arrangement. So there are circumstances under which this sort of seasonal work is not as attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, without doubt, it is a problem for those industries that require this seasonal work to fill that employment need. It is always a difficulty for them. We have had to make some special arrangements vis-a-vis the new employment services market because of that specific difficulty. It is because of the difficulty in filling that need, of people choosing to look for other work, shall I put it, rather than taking that work, that in the past those visa entitlements have been increased. At the same time, we are always looking for our young Australians to be able to go overseas and get visas for short-term work&mdash;not a situation that we can readily encourage and enhance if the reciprocal opportunity is not made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that I do not have a brief on it, I will raise this matter with the immigration minister. If there is any more information he wishes to raise with you, I will come back to you.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party record in relation to small business saw higher taxes, industrial relations laws which caused huge problems to small business and, of course, record interest rates. Our policies across the board are designed to help small business grow, invest and create jobs. Whether the issue is interest rates, industrial relations or tax reform, we are the party of small business; we are the government of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a very fine record in relation to small business, and many key measures are already in law to help small business. In the area of taxation, for example, we have cut the provisional uplift factor and made sure it is kept at a reasonable level, unlike Labor who, year after year, kept the uplift factor unreasonably high, damaging small business cash flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have eased the FBT record&hyphen;keeping burdens on small business, something which the Labor Party never did. We have taken a number of other measures in relation to FBT to ease the burden on small business. We have also allowed small business to remit tax withholding payments quarterly rather than monthly&mdash;something else that the Labor Party never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We committed ourselves in the election to help small business by providing CGT rollover relief when small business owners sold their business to buy another and where owners used the proceeds of their business for retirement. From the feedback that I have received, these measures have been particularly welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, given its 13&hyphen;year record, the Labor Party is anti small business.

It is going to look at whether Abstudy in its current form is appropriate.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5673">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure the Senate and the people of Australia that the government is committed to ensuring that there is an effective national effort in fighting the menace of illicit drugs. As the Prime Minister announced yesterday, he has established a task force to prepare an urgent report on a national approach to illicit drugs and an agenda for national action. This task force is to be chaired by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and includes the head of all relevant agencies. The task force will look at current efforts to reduce the supply of drugs, including domestic law enforcement and border control. It will also look at current efforts to reduce the demand for illicit drugs and advise on the allocation of resources to achieve more effective use of Commonwealth funds against illicit drugs. Its report will form the basis of the government's strategy to be put before the special meeting of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the Australian Customs Service, the Customs resources specifically devoted to anti&hyphen;drug efforts have not been reduced during the time of general budget expenditure reduction. In the 1996&hyphen;97 fiscal year, a total of 174 kilograms of heroin was seized. This was double the total of the previous year's seizure. Since 1 July this year, Customs has intercepted approximately 81 kilograms of heroin at the border. Effective anti&hyphen;drug efforts at the border by Customs are not just a product of resources alone but also involve the most effective use of intelligence and the available resources it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions in expenditure that have been referred to were part of the government's overall budget strategy and have not and will not affect the capacity of Customs to do its job. I might add that in the 1996 budget, the government provided $26 million towards technology to aid in drug detection and interception. In 1997, this year's budget, funding was provided for an upgrade in the Customs fleet, and an acquisition process for eight new vessels has commenced. Since 1 July last year, the Customs coastwatch program has been able to significantly increase its surveillance capacity. Operations are now able to be conducted up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to 300 nautical miles from the coast of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for claims by Mr Beazley and Premier Carr that cuts to the AFP budget are undermining the fight against drugs, let me say this: the Attorney-General has advised me that any cuts to the AFP budget have come from administration spending. The cut was part of an ongoing budget deficit reduction strategy applied by the federal government. The AFP is managing its expenditure to ensure that it maintains its commitment to important operations and activities within projected budget allocations for the current financial year. The AFP has in place a national framework for priority which ensures that all matters are properly and appropriately assessed and prioritised against available resources. This government is committed to addressing this issue and it will do so.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. The minister would be aware of criticism within the community of the practice amongst universities of relying solely on a student's tertiary education rank to determine whether the student will be offered a place at university. What is the basis of this criticism? Can the minister outline the government's position on the TER? Has the minister read the comments of the shadow minister for education, Mr Mark Latham, who asserts that the TER is a good system that rewards students who work hard?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a truly remarkable statement from the shadow minister. Of all the comments that have been made on the TER recently, I have never heard anyone defend it so dogmatically as simply to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, `It is a good system that rewards students who work hard.' Why would the shadow spokesperson have such faith in the TER as an index of merit? Perhaps that is not such a mystery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Latham has to believe in the infallibility of the TER because that is the basis of rationing publicly funded places in universities. If the TER is not accurate to two decimal places, then the reasoning behind the opposition to full fee places crumbles. People who fail to gain a place through the TER but who are just a few decimal points short, and who are willing to pay their way, cannot possibly be called, as Labor calls them, `the dumb rich'. If the TER is not an infallible measure of merit then the reliance on opposing full fee places falls apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is actually Mr Latham who is not so smart. Medical schools&mdash;the most heavily and carefully rationed of university places&mdash;have moved beyond the TER. They use interviews and other specialised testing in the allocation of places to people from groups from which it is desirable to get doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who is familiar with the TER knows that its supposed two&hyphen;decimal place accuracy is spurious. Many people can be systematically disadvantaged. The Mount Druitt students who gained prominence earlier this year through some reporting, on which there was appropriate comment, are very good examples. They suffered because of the preference in their school for vocational subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Latham is aware of that disadvantage and he is aware that it is apparent in TER distributions, and he has a solution. Mr Latham&mdash;your education spokesman&mdash;has a solution. He says that we should educate the parents. He knows that the TER is a problem but he does not want to admit it, so his idea is to educate the parents. He said&mdash;and you should listen to this very carefully&mdash;`In public housing estates, where people have become way too welfare reliant, they have the time and the need for those sorts of parent&hyphen;as&hyphen;educator programs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what Mr Latham thinks. In other words, he is saying that kids can be disadvantaged for a whole variety of reasons in their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5675"> TER and he has a recommendation on how to fix it&mdash;educate the parents. He cannot possibly hold both positions. He cannot say that the TER is an infallible measure of a student's merit and at the same time say that some students' parents need a parent&hyphen;as&hyphen;educator program&mdash;although I have spoken to a number of parents who think they might benefit from that because of the homework they are required to assist with!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from being patronising and offensive, this statement shows that Mr Latham simply does not understand TER scores. The problem is that they do not always reflect merit. You do not need to blame parents or schools. The problem is the concept of a single index of merit, not where the kids come from or who their parents are. There are other things you can do to overcome disadvantage in educational opportunities, but this does not mean, and it will never mean, that a single TER score is an appropriate measure of merit for assessment for university.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator Childs today, relating to employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Child's question referred to the most important issue facing this country today, that is, the issue of unemployment and related to that, of course, job insecurity. Senator Childs asked Senator Vanstone for the definition of an employment placement for the purposes of the success fee for the new private employment agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had today was a typical response from the minister. Yet again there was evasion and an attempt not only to avoid answering the question but also to avoid accepting any responsibility for the jobs crisis in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone has consistently attempted to dodge responsibility and to dodge any real answer to finding real solutions to the chronic unemployment problem which faces this country. The latest attempt by Senator Vanstone, together with her ministerial colleagues, is another in a long, long list of excuses for what is emerging as an increasing unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to look at the statistics over the last year, particularly since last August's budget, to see the worsening unemployment rates right around Australia. In March 1996, when this government was elected, the unemployment rate across the nation was 8.5 per cent, and it has been trending gradually upwards almost continuously ever since to stand at 8.7 per cent as of July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other interesting aspects of the worsening unemployment rate is the participation rate which, in July last year, stood at just over 63.5 per cent and, in July this year, has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dropped to 63.2 per cent. Importantly, we have had, a worsening youth unemployment rate which stood at just over 26.4 per cent in July last year and is currently at 27.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone continually attempts to dodge and weave any real solution to this issue. Her ministerial colleagues have attempted to do the same, but Senator Vanstone certainly stands out amongst the ministers opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a long litany of excuses. The argument was put last year that we had to get the budget into balance. That in itself, of course, has created some of the problems that this country is faced with today. That budget went a long way, Senator Vanstone, to destroying the confidence of the community, particularly with respect to small business demand. There has been a lot said about small business by this government. But if Senator Vanstone and her colleagues had been listening, over the last few months in particular, they would have found that the number one concern of business is the issue of consumer confidence and consumers spending money. They are concerned about rising unemployment and job insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the next excuse, which was the industrial relations system. The industrial relations system needed modernising. It needed to be made more flexible so that small business could employ more people. We have seen no evidence to date that the changes to the industrial relations system have contributed to that.</PARA>

The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, went to the United States and discovered computers. He also discovered, at least for two days, the argument that we should be lowering wages. We now have the latest excuse for unemployment, and that is the tax system. The Prime Minister has decided to invent a broad based indirect tax, commonly known as a BBIT.

I think what the Australian people remember, Senator Sherry, is your 13 years in office and the enormous pain they endured under high levels of unemployment. When I came into this parliament in 1991, unemployment was a little 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over nine per cent, and then it went to 10 per cent and then it went to 11 per cent. The average right over the period was 8&half; per cent. Senator Sherry, you expect us to wave a magic wand and fix this problem immediately. We are still trying to cope with your 13 years of mismanagement of the economy when you missed many golden opportunities. You took foreign debt from $20 billion up to $180 billion and created enormous problems for our economy. You then say, `Why haven't you people fixed it in 18 months?'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember looking at the figures in 1986 when your government had been in power for four years, and we had 25 per cent youth unemployment at that stage. I note that you did not mention that figure, Senator. When you left office, your figure was up to 28 per cent. What a great improvement in 11 years! You actually went backwards. You did not solve this problem. You actually made the problem worse. It was actually a lot worse than the figures indicated, because you kept hiding people on the unemployment queue. You kept defining people off the queue. We have this huge pool of hidden unemployment on top of the official figure that we had to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talked about targets in what you had to say, and I believe your target is five per cent by the turn of the century. Every economic commentator that I have read on the subject said that, unless you are running the economy absolutely full bore&mdash;therefore sucking in more foreign debt; that is, foreign debt that you helped create&mdash;you would have no chance of getting anywhere near five per cent. You were not going to make the five per cent because, as Senator Campbell pointed out, your solution was really no solution. Working Nation&mdash;what a joke!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5679">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at the outcomes of the so-called Working Nation program. Thirty per cent of the people who undertook your programs actually got a job. Seventy per cent in Working Nation went back onto the unemployment scrap heap. What a program that was! It cost hundreds of millions of dollars. At least this government is focusing on getting the fundamentals right&mdash;something Paul Keating should have done back in the mid-1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at the way the interest rates are still dropping. Have a look at the budget deficit. That is another figure you did not mention, Senator Sherry. Have a look at what the budget deficit was when you left office and compare that with the budget surplus that we are now moving towards under good financial management. Look at the micro-economic reforms that we have instigated in industrial relations in terms of small business, which is the real job generator. What this government is concerned about is not make&hyphen;work programs. This government is concerned about actual jobs. That is generated by the small business sector, and that is generated by getting the economic settings right. Senator Sherry, I was absolutely amazed you got up and spoke on this matter, given the record of your government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government went to the last election with a program of pathways to real jobs. They are the terms that have been consistently used by this government both to condemn the Working Nation program and to try to talk up their pretty pathetic efforts in this area. But when we look at the matters that were the subject of questions today&mdash;and we are looking at, in particular, the minister's employment services request for tender&mdash;we see that there is a proposal to pay private providers for establishing a real job for an unemployed person, a person who is eligible for benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A real job? How many hours a week? Fifteen hours a week over five days. The job has to be no fewer than three hours per day. That is a real job. This government is going to spend, in the minister's terms, $1.7 billion between May next year and December 1999 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to get people into real jobs. This is the achievement&mdash;the benchmark&mdash;that this government is aiming for. The government has the nerve to criticise Working Nation for under achievement when it has set such a low bar benchmark for its own achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul Cleary, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 8 August&mdash;Senator Childs referred to this article in his question&mdash;was absolutely scathing in his condemnation of this program. You see, when the minister had legislation before this parliament the bar for a real job was going to be set at 20 hours. Now the minister has lowered the bar to 15 hours a week over five days. In the words of Mr Cleary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even for the most employable unemployed, the Government believes it must lower the hurdle to a pathetic level to make the scheme a success.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are not my words&mdash;they are the words of Mr Cleary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . They are a condemnation of this approach by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Real jobs are defined in the government's own documents as 15 hours a week. That is what they want. We are not talking about the statistician's figures&mdash;let us get the red herrings off the table. We are talking about the jobs that this government said it was going to create. These are the jobs that this government is going to pay people to arrange. In other words, they are going to get a private provider and say, `We will pay whatever you have contracted to provide. As long as the job is three hours a day over five days a week, and lasts for a minimum period, you will get paid. That is all we want.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mark has changed from the outcome proposed by the previous tender. Originally the minister was saying that you would pay the premium for a primary outcome of 20 hours, which would have got the person off unemployment benefit. The secondary outcome at that stage was the proposal of between 15 and 19 hours. What is now the primary outcome was, then, the secondary outcome. You really do not know what you are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you want to talk about waste, let us have a look at something that did come up in the estimates hearings&mdash;something that we did 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5680"> ascertain. Under the training for employment program this government is funding a company it knows nothing about to the tune of $800 per person per week. The company is to provide hospitality training for jobs that at this stage do not exist, on a ship that at this stage is not in Australian waters, and probably is not owned by the company in question. The government is providing this funding without checking the company. This is the record of this government. This is the record of this minister in relation to Commonwealth money that is being spent under the training for employment program. This government is going to create jobs by throwing money away possibly, by spending $800 per person per week on a training program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of expenditure makes any criticism of Working Nation, in terms of its levels of expenditure, absolutely irrelevant. This government has done nothing to create real jobs. This government's programs are demonstrably wasteful. Spending $1.7 billion over a period of 18 months on a program which is able to provide only the minimal sorts of jobs that it defines is just not good enough.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did nothing about reform in industrial relations; they did nothing about encouraging small business to employ people.

They did nothing to reform. In fact, what they are going to do now is to oppose legislation which still affects small business and means that they will not employ. You go and talk to small business people; you go and talk to my father who, at 76, employs people. He will not employ them because he finds it too difficult. So small business person after small business person will not create jobs because of the industrial relations system you left. You will not actually recognise that you

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Senator Sherry, who went on to say that getting the budget to balance has caused a lot of problems, he did not mention the problems that giving us $180 million of foreign debt has caused us. He did not mention the problem created by having to repay $10 billion a year on the interest on the debt that you chalked up. What about what that does to jobs, to the economy, to the impost we put on business, and the disincentives for creating jobs? He did not mention that&mdash;he did not mention the legacy of that and he did not mention that that is still the indelible stain that has been left from your mismanagement. No, he would go on a spending spree as you all did. If you get your hands on the levers again, it would be spend, spend, spend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to speak to the motion to take note of the answer given to the question asked by Senator Childs. I would like to go back to the point raised by Senator Sherry, which was that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in fact evaded addressing the question. The question was that the government was changing the definition of an employment placement for the purposes of paying a success fee to new private employment agencies from 20 hours to 15 hours a week. What did the minister say? The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister referred to ABS statistics. That is irrelevant to the point; they have not been changed. There has been no change between when Labor was in government and the present government in relation to ABS statistics. The point is that the government is changing the definition of what will be regarded as a real job in relation to employment placements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister actually does comment about what will be regarded as a real job, she says something vague such as, `Oh, we're doing assessments on what will be regarded as a reasonable standard for someone to be independent and that is 15 hours.' She would not respond to interjections about why we are dropping from 20 hours down to 15. I do not think she had much understanding of that point at all. I challenge the government to actually give us details of how they assess whether 15 hours a week of work is enough for somebody to regard themselves, or for the government to regard them, as earning sufficient income to be independent. I know a lot of workers out there who work 15, 20, 25 hours a week and I know that they are struggling on the income they have, let alone having their definition dropped down to 15 hours a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our chronic employment problems is not just unemployment, but chronic under&hyphen;employment. This government is hoping to contribute to that further and also hoping to avoid some of its obligations in relation to employment in its election commitments by shifting people off unemployment statistically. That is what this is really about. It is a last&hyphen;minute attempt to try to do something which will shift the statistics but still not provide an answer to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the point of the minister evading giving the Senate decent answers to these questions, I would also like in passing to refer to the answer to my question. The minister referred to seasonal work in relation to our concerns about an increase in the number of overseas workers coming in and taking jobs from young people in Australia. The minister has no idea whether seasonal workers are taking those jobs&mdash;no idea at all. Such poor answers highlight the lack of

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second race being run is: small business reforms will provide employment. We have no record from that from any of the reforms to date, similarly with respect to the Workplace Relations Act. Another claim is that more unfair dismissal changes for small business will generate employment. Through estimates we know there is no justification for those claims.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5683"> Australians' woes were caused by Malcolm Fraser but mostly John Howard when he was Treasurer. Senator Collins, if we do from time to time over the next few years remind you and remind the Australian people that the previous governments were not the greatest economic managers this place has ever seen, then I apologise. You can say that we are playing a bit of politics, but I think in Parliament House most people would expect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons people do not have as much confidence as we would like them to have at the moment is the consumers of Australia had some fairly horrendous experiences over the last 13 years. Those horrendous experiences were caused because you had incompetent people managing the economic levers. Mr Keating, the previous Prime Minister and Treasurer, used to come into the other place and brag about how he had the economic levers so firmly in his hands and Australia was in very good shape and in very good hands. He had the Reserve Bank in his pocket, he had Treasury in his pocket, and Finance in his pocket, and it was all under control and she'll be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do you know what scared a lot of Australians? When Mr Keating was Treasurer and he would say that `it is a beautiful set of numbers' or `this is the budget that brings home the bacon' and people would see interest rates coming down or employment trending down momentarily, they believed him. They believed that Mr Keating was getting it right. They would start investing in small businesses and buying homes and paying reasonable interest rates and then within a few minutes of Mr Keating coming out and saying that all of a sudden he would have to pull the brakes on. Interest rates would go down just below 10 per cent and, wham, Mr Keating when he was Mr Hawke's Treasurer and then Prime Minister would all of a sudden have to rip the brakes on and interest rates would go zooming from less than 10 per cent up to 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people out there remember that&mdash;people who had mortgages, who were forced to sell their homes, or lost their businesses, or went bankrupt as a result of the economic management by the previous Labor govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. We are not going to let them forget that because we have to bring good financial management into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want people to have income security and job security you do not do it by coming up with schemes like Working Nation which basically had the political task of churning people through the unemployment statistics just long enough to get you to the last election. That was the effect of spending billions of dollars on Working Nation. It churned particularly young people through the employment statistics. It did not create real jobs. It did not create jobs in businesses. It did not create jobs in free enterprise. It did not create sustainable jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to ensuring that you have security of employment, but you do not do that by running the national economy on bankcard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</PARA>

The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, to understand and defend public schools as revealed by her unprecedented attack on Australia's public education system in a recent speech to the American Chamber of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Vanstone, as Australia's education minister who is responsible for the public school system in this country, has betrayed every student in the system. She has betrayed every teacher in the system. She has betrayed every parent who is dependent on the system. She has betrayed every product of that school system. We know that there are lies, damn lies and statistics but, after all and after that, there is Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone, using a bodgie spin on certain ABS statistics, while speaking to, of all people, the American Chamber of Commerce, concluded that private schools were a one&hyphen;way ticket to work, whereas 14 per cent of male students graduating in the public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system would find themselves unemployed. She then stated, `Private schools have beaten unemployment.' They are her words: `Private schools have beaten unemployment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process, she has angered, worried and concerned parents. She has certainly worried and affected young people right across Australia who go to those selfsame public schools. I think Senator Vanstone, giving her some credit here because perhaps it was inadvertent&mdash;I hope it was inadvertent&mdash;was saying to employers that private school graduates are better than those from public schools. That was the thrust of what Senator Vanstone was saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone has insulted those who work in the public school system. She has insulted the teachers who work in the public schools, and she has managed to do that to the point where the Secondary School Principals Association has threatened to boycott government youth programs which require the cooperation of schools. The national president of that association, Mr Duncan Stalker, stated point&hyphen;blank on ABC Radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's Senator Vanstone who's grossly distorted the statistics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that Senator Vanstone has forgotten that she is the minister in government charged with the responsibility for public school funding. She is the minister responsible for protecting our schools. She is the minister who is responsible for the quality of public schools. Instead of offering constructive solutions about progressing public education in this country in a positive way&mdash;public education which she is responsible for&mdash;she has made carping, negative, destructive comments and she has washed her hands of the responsibility for these schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even after the minister for education, Senator Vanstone, blurted out this dubious, statistical adventure and was roundly criticised by parents, teachers, commentators and editorial writers about a fortnight ago&mdash;she copped an absolute lacing&mdash;she repeated her statistical spin on Wednesday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A.M.</EMPHASIS> radio program. It may be a source of astonishment to Senator Vanstone, but private schools 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5691"> do not create the jobs necessary to beat unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 14 August because I think it said it all. The headline was very instructive. The headline of the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> was `Schools can't make jobs, Senator'. But, of course, in that madcap diatribe from Senator Vanstone, she did not mention the location advantage of most private schools. She did not mention the fact that around 70 per cent of students attend public schools in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She did not mention the fact that private schools can pick and choose their students, while public schools&mdash;even in the face of this reprehensible government's policies of funding cuts&mdash;strive to provide a high quality standard of education for kids who come from all backgrounds. The public school system in this country takes all comers and it strives for excellence. It does not deserve the put&hyphen;down, smear and libel of this minister for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, in what I thought was a rather deluded moment, tried to defend Senator Vanstone. It was a very lukewarm defence, I might say. He said on 13 August that he was a product of the public school system. Let me quote what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I won't have the public education system run down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Mr Howard said. Let me interpolate here. What was he talking about? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those sort of comparisons&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were Mr Howard's words. What he was talking about were the bodgie statistical comparisons that were offered up by his education minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those sort of comparisons don't make proper allowance for some of the circumstances in which government schools have got to operate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are Mr Howard's words, as he was trying to repair just some of the damage that his incompetent Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 18 months of ideologically, hide&hyphen;bound government, Mr Howard has made it tougher for those government schools by slashing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $270 million from schools funding through enrolment benchmark adjustments, with a real cut to Commonwealth secondary education of 7.8 per cent. Of course, the coalition is financing the private school sector at the expense of government schools. What we say is that this is simply just not a fair policy. These are the new found circumstances in which, under Mr Howard, public schools have got to operate. Senator Vanstone keeps on maintaining that the public school system is not delivering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, Senator Vanstone added insult to injury by stating that the statistical quirk could be because of the backgrounds of the kids that attend public schools. She said that she made the statement to focus on the fact that schools had to prepare children for life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one problem background that Senator Vanstone did not bother to mention&mdash;that is, the government's own problem background, which is its lack of attention and focus on solving the youth unemployment problem. Since Mr Howard's government was elected, youth unemployment has gone up. However much we have huff and puff from Senator Vanstone about jobless statistics prior to the 1996 election, the facts are that youth unemployment was dropping under Labor and youth unemployment is rising under the coalition government. I think the government has some responsibility for preparing the economic circumstances to create jobs for school leavers in this country, and it has not done it and it is not doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone's arrogant disdain for the public school sector is highlighted by the inaction over the influx of extra students into grades 11 and 12 next January because of changes to the youth unemployment payment regime&mdash;that is, the common youth allowance. In a Senate estimates committee last week, she was given the rounds of the kitchen. She admitted that she had not given much thought at all to the requirements of the 27,000 grades 11 and 12 school children her department predicts will remain at school. Parents and students who might be affected by this particular measure from July next year will make the decision about whether the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5692"> students should remain at school this coming January. That is only five months away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone had not carried out a state by state breakdown as to where the greatest educational need would be and where these young Australians might need extra assistance&mdash;with further attention to literacy, numeracy, vocational counselling, job placement and the like. We hear that many of these young people do not want to be in schools because, as senators know, they are uncomfortable in a teaching situation. Some of them do not have the skills to fit the requirements for grades 11 and 12. Many are young people who will need special help and, if they are not catered for properly, they are possibly likely to disrupt classrooms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much extra will it cost? Of course, Senator Vanstone does not know. What programs will be put in place? Senator Vanstone has not thought about it. She has not got a clue. What we in opposition say is that this attitude from Senator Vanstone and her junior minister is one of almost criminal neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the department has thought about the problem, because of a cabinet submission that has been obtained by the opposition. Several measures costing up to $140 million were supposed to be presented by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Kemp, and Minister Vanstone in that flaky exercise which was the underattended cabinet meeting held on 5 August, when everyone was either on holidays or off crook.</PARA>

But the department recommended the expansion of the jobs pathway program; extra vocational training programs; the introduction of the students' intervention program based on Labor's students at risk program, which was previously abolished by Senator Vanstone; and an expansion of the student traineeship foundation, which was a 1994 Labor initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Vanstone and Minister Kemp, fighting with each other of course all the time, have been silent on these proposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs. In question time yesterday the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, brushed aside our inquiries on these issues. From the tenor of Senator Vanstone's responses to Senate estimates and in the Senate chamber, the suggestions from her department have been utterly ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of getting on with the job of solving the mounting problems in state schools that have been caused by Senator Vanstone, she spends valuable ministerial time in bagging the system which she is in charge of, bagging the system for which she has responsibility and calling for the system to perform better, while she cuts back on funding, while she chops resources and, from January next year, adds 27,000 more young people, who may not be suited to it, to grade 11 and 12 education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Single-handedly, she has insulted the higher education system. We called previously for the Prime Minister to get rid of this incompetent minister, to replace her with someone else, and our request for action to the Prime Minister still stands. She is responsible for single&hyphen;handed alienation of the public school sector in 1997 through her inept handling of her portfolio. It increases the urgency on Mr Howard to sack her now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only conclude that Senator Faulkner has not in fact looked at the whole speech in relation to his comments. He presents the speech as one attacking the government school system. He knows full well that this government is absolutely committed to choice in schools, to a strong and vibrant school system and, equally, to a strong and vibrant non&hyphen;government school system&mdash;and, for the those parents that are able to have a choice, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5693"> to have that choice unhindered by government regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He says that the import of the speech that I made a couple of weeks ago was, I think in his terminology, `to bag government schools'. Apparently, this is how one does it. One does it by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not to say that some government schools are not already achieving excellent results.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then you might pick one and say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salisbury High School here in Adelaide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">where the speech was made&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is one such school. I understand that they have an employment rate of something like 98 per cent for their students.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This can only be described as excellent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Apparently, picking out a government school, nominating the record that they have in providing what their students need, pointing out that they have a 98 per cent achievement rate and describing it as excellent is somehow engaging in a process of bagging government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite anybody who wants to make a decision as to this government's attitude to read the whole speech. I heard Senator Faulkner say, `Lies, damn lies and statistics'. I could equally have said, `Whole speeches and simple excerpts taken from', and could have asked him to go back and have a good look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out the words: `This can only be described as excellent'. I was picking out a government school&mdash;not picking out a particular private school&mdash;as the example I wanted to use of a school that could provide everything that its students needed. If that is bagging government schools, I am a loss for words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I went on and pointed that the need to put vocational education back into schools is very important. Earlier in the speech, I had highlighted the changing nature of the young labour force. It is a very diminished labour force, because young Australians are less and less choosing to leave school without any additional training to look for the ever decreasing number of unskilled jobs. But that only highlights that, for those students who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to do that, vocational training is very important to equip them for the choice in life that they want to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went on to highlight that we are working with the states in respect of this matter. I pointed out that under the arrangements of the Victorian minister for training, Phil Honeywood, 8,000 young Australians are studying vocational subjects at school which count towards their final years and an apprenticeship or a traineeship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went on from that to indicate that the vocational training in schools need not be a lock&hyphen;off for students and that, as I understand it, 24 per cent of students undertaking vocational subjects at school in Victoria last year have continued on to university. I pointed out that that shows that vocational education need not block students out. That demonstrates the efforts of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to put vocational training back into schools, particularly government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went on to mention Minister Colin Barnett in Western Australia, who has also recognised the need for schools to have closer links with industry to cater for the needs of its students; and that if you have more students who want to go into the work force, if a higher proportion of your students want to do that, then obviously you have to cater for them. Mr Barnett recognises that in Western Australia and is doing an excellent job of highlighting the importance of school to work transition with the development of multipurpose campuses. These campuses bring together schools, training providers and nearby businesses&mdash;in other words, schools providing what students want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After about two weeks of coverage on this speech I am beginning to wonder if, irrespective of what is said in this, somebody is going to try to say that this government is anti government schools. That is not the case. I have repeated that time and time again. Minister Kemp has repeated it time and time again and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has repeated it time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition can keep dragging this cat out of the bag, hoping to have a further media beat&hyphen;up of this issue&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. You have had your opportunity. The reasoning behind the speech, the purposes of the speech were to emphasise the government's clear intention to support both government and private schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the full&hyphen;time youth labour market is now less than half what it was in the 1980s. Social and economic changes mean that the jobs that once were there for young people as entry points no longer exist. Even when the labour market as a whole picks up, the kinds of jobs that did exist will not return; they will be different sorts of jobs. The challenge now is to continue the increased emphasis on vocation and education in schools, and to establish links between schools and employers. I know that in schools where a high proportion of students is undertaking vocational education, current methods of university entrance selection can often present barriers to those particular students. This is an appropriate time to raise this point. I have allocated $1 million to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that university assessment based on a single TER score is unfairly disadvantaging some students. It is very important that, when students make their choices in senior secondary school, they keep their options open. They need to be able to choose vocational subjects without feeling that they are closing off the opportunity to go to university. I also highlighted the importance of establishing links between schools and employers so that students can get a feel for what employers are looking for and employers can get to know young people and tap their talents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, in Adelaide&mdash;my own state&mdash;I pointed to the example of Salisbury High. I used that as the pinnacle example of what a school can do. Despite picking a government school as the best example around to show what can be done to cater for students, despite quoting its record of 98 per cent, despite pointing out that that is an excellent result and despite having time and time again used a government school as an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> example of excellent provision of what students need, some people still try to characterise both me and this government as being opposed to government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will take the opportunity in the few minutes remaining to me to do what senators opposite should be doing if they are genuinely in support of government schools rather than simply trying to distort speeches for political purposes. They should be quoting examples of where government schools are doing so very well. There are plenty of examples of government schools which are doing very well. For example, I turn to Upwey High School in Victoria. I am advised that all but three of last year's 138 year 12 school leavers are now employed or have gone on to further education. That bears repeating: at Upwey High School in Victoria, all but three of last year's 138 year 12 school leavers are now employed or have gone on to further education. Upwey High School is a non&hyphen;selective neighbourhood school in an outer suburb of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those results, like those at Salisbury High, the other government school I referred to, are outstanding. They reflect very well on the leadership of the school, the staff and the community. Bradfield College in New South Wales has had similar results. It opens six days a week, and builds on a unique partnership between TAFE and school programs. Students can get TAFE qualifications, get the benefit of industry training and complete secondary school at the same time. I have already covered the operations of Salisbury High School. These are very exciting developments in the government school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than simply look at individual schools, I will look at some international benchmarking. At the third international mathematics study Australia did very well. In science, out of 24 countries, only Korea was ranked ahead of Australia. In mathematics, only four countries were ranked ahead of Australia. That would not be possible if we did not have a strong excellent government school system. It is a vital part of our national infrastructure, and our commitment to is unequivocal. If senators opposite want to protect, enhance and promote government

I am quite sure that most of those students would do better at constructing logical arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will get back to the question of the assault on schools. We are, I think, accustomed in this country to state governments attacking teacher unions&mdash;it is usually teacher unions. But I do not think I can recall any time in Australia's history when government schools&mdash;and I emphasise that it is government schools we are talking about here&mdash;have been blamed for everything from unemployment to withholding information from parents, failing to be competitive and preparing students for university or not preparing students for university, as the case may be on occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's speech to the American Australian Chamber of Commerce this month 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gave the message that schools play a critical role in preparing young people for life. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not TER factories preparing some for universities and giving less attention to others.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Today we have heard quite a lot about the problems with TER scores and their irrelevance. As an aside, I think we all wait with some trepidation for what the announcement will be on how TER scores will be replaced. We also know that not all students go to university, and that the overall percentage of students from private schools going on to university is higher in private schools than it is in government schools. Nobody would be surprised by that information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people understand the close relationship between income levels and both retention rates and university entry. Time and time again, studies have shown this. This is the reason why we have a publicly funded education system in this country. I would like to remind the minister and honourable senators of that. The handful of government schools whose intake is selective on the basis of results, for instance, also show that high correlation between ability, family background of tertiary education and success at university entry. We also know that the more prestigious private schools with the highest TER scores actively encourage those students who are unlikely to get entry into university from even participating in those final years in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the minister's remarks about entry should have been more particularly directed at private schools. I would have thought that the reason the government this year gave so generously&mdash;I think it was $1,730 per student&mdash;for vocational education in private schools was that it was private schools which had to be encouraged to address the question of vocational education. That is what the minister said at the time. This windfall&mdash;which, of course, we found out does not have to be accounted for in the same way as it does in government schools&mdash;was, according to her, given as an incentive to private schools to broaden their current focus on university entrance. There 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5696"> was no mention of that in her address to the chamber. What she did say was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . putting vocational education back into schools gives students work related skills. It is something that my portfolio is encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Patterson will note that I am again quoting from the speech. Minister, I think the senator and our government schools would like to know just how you are encouraging that vocational education. The minister's logic on unemployment is, however, somewhat more interesting. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For boys who completed year 12 in 1995, twice as many boys from government schools chose to enter the workforce than boys from non-government schools. However, of more interest is that 35% of boys from government schools entering the workforce, that is, leaving school to look for work, couldn't get a job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on to triumphantly announce that this means that 14 per cent of all boys finishing at a government school were unemployed. I have to say that there are many parts of Australia where 14 per cent unemployment levels for young people would be very welcome indeed. In the Fairfield&hyphen;Liverpool area in New South Wales, the unemployment rate for boys aged 15 to 24 is 24.1 per cent. In Geelong in my home state, it is 20.8 per cent. In the west Adelaide region, the figure is 21.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real point that the minister wants to make is the fact that non-government schools do so much better. Only two per cent of boys from non-government schools are unemployed. We do not know quite where that figure comes from. But even accepting that it is an ABS estimate and that it is accurate, what exactly lies behind this expose?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November last year when the government's states grants bill opened the way for the expansion of the private school system, paid for by cuts to the state system, we pointed out that this represented a very serious lack of commitment to public education. We also pointed out that the government's attacks on government schools were part of a very obvious campaign to encourage all those parents who could possibly afford to do so to take their children from state schools and put them into private schools.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government schools in every state in this country are getting fewer resources, less choice in curriculum and, as the recent Senate education committee found, they are having to rely more and more on fees and sponsorship to pay for the most basic education facilities. We pointed out that the government was allowing its ideology of privilege over equity, of private over public, to threaten the system of education in this country, and we stand by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this notion of education were some kind of minor initiative of the previous government, perhaps we could understand Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp's eagerness to demolish that system before our very eyes. But it is not some minor initiative. It is not some bright idea which did not work. I would go so far as to say that Australians believe that education is the most important public service that the government has responsibility for. You would expect a government that is there to act in the best interests of all Australians to support and defend and enhance the system of education which at the present time serves 70 per cent of Australian families. The Democrats would be very happy to see the government identify any deficiencies in education and to begin to remedy those. But is that what we are seeing? I do not think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch quickly on the question of literacy. Senator Vanstone said in her speech that `the lack of literacy and numeracy skills among our people is of particular concern,' and she links this to the question of unemployment yet again. This is a favourite subject of Dr Kemp's as well. The only response to this high level of concern is to reduce funding for literacy by nine per cent in real terms from previous budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part of the government's strategy so far is to test children endlessly and to publish those results. I think the idea is that students and teachers will pull themselves up by their bootstraps, driven by competition&mdash;presumably from other schools. This is something of a departure from the previous line, which was that our curriculum was too crowded&mdash;any excuse it seems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp lurch from one ill-informed statement to the next on this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5697"> question of literacy. In many ways, this reminds me of the intemperate and ignorant outpourings of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I have read Senator Vanstone's speech, and I must say that the conclusion I have come to is that the urgency motion is fundamentally misconceived. Senator Allison seems to be confusing destination rates with the unemployment rate, whereas the speech of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, addressed the importance of making both government and non&hyphen;government schools more relevant to cater for the needs of all students.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is totally committed to the excellent government school system we have in Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record some of the initiatives and achievements of the government school system that this government and the minister support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, referring to resources for schools, the federal government has provided a sound basis for supporting schools to meet these challenges. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act passed last year guarantees funding for schools for the next four years to the tune of more than $14 billion over the period 1997&hyphen;2000. The Commonwealth budget papers for 1996&hyphen;97 show that funding for schools is estimated to increase by an average of just over four per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's funding priorities reflect the importance we place on both literacy and numeracy. State and territory education ministers agreed in March this year to the national literacy and numeracy plan which

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2M6">Senator COONAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A major policy initiative of this government is to provide all young people with strong foundation literacy skills. The Commonwealth Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, has worked collaboratively with state and territory ministers for education to put in place a comprehensive national plan to improve literacy and numeracy skills for all young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth makes a significant financial contribution to schools of more than $3 billion a year&mdash;specifically, $153 million a year through the literacy program. The literacy grants to schools will provide $579 million over 1997&hyphen;2000 to be paid to government and non&hyphen;government schools and education authorities who are able to use funds in appropriate ways to achieve the broad objectives of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government takes literacy of our young people seriously. Last year it undertook the first national survey for 16 years of the literacy achievements of Australian school children. The results of the survey are shortly to be released and will provide for the very first time a national picture of literacy achievement which will clearly show where efforts need to be directed if we are to achieve the national goal for literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is providing a package of funding measures to promote effective and reliable pathways for students from schooling to employment&mdash;surely one of the most important initiatives of this government. Funds are to be used to support programs for school students which combine study towards a senior secondary certificate with nationally recognised, accredited vocational education and training. The government is committed to reforms that ensure that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5698"> school leavers are better prepared for continuing training and further education, or for entering the work force, whatever they are capable of doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the March meeting the Commonwealth sought the support of state education ministers for a commitment to re&hyphen;examine the roles of schools, both government and non&hyphen;government, to achieve the goal that all students should find schooling relevant and valuable and that schooling leads to further education, training or full and productive employment. This would include removing barriers for schools to become employment service providers, providing incentives for all schools to develop strategic alliances with local employment service providers. Each year for four calendar years $20 million will be provided to state training authorities for allocation to school authorities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, to understand and defend public schools as revealed by her unprecedented attack on Australia's public education system in a recent speech to the American Australian Chamber of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At this point I remind the Senate of what it was that the minister said. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In total, the ABS estimates that of school leavers at the end of year 12 who end up being unemployed the proportion from government schools is ten times greater than the proportion from non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that for school leavers, private schools have beaten unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What nonsense! What an appalling, extraordinary attack upon the public education system! What is so appalling about that is that it in fact articulates the private views of this government. For the first time we have seen it out in the open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the first time in the life of this government; this is the first time this century that we have seen any government make a public declaration of the private prejudices of the Tory party in this country. For the first time, we have seen this notion that the government does not have a moral obligation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5699"> to ensure that there is a universal public education service of the highest quality available to all Australians. This viewpoint is thoroughly deplorable. It implies that everything which is privately owned is good and that which is publicly owned is bad. We have a picture of this Tory government which they actively seek reassurance for on a constant basis. This is a backward&hyphen;looking government which seeks to gather information to support such an outdated notion, to support this spurious claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they seek to do is to provide data no matter how spurious that data is. The minister is putting the proposition, through the American Chamber of Commerce, that, no matter what damage is done to the reputations of the public institutions of this country, it does not matter, so long as it advances the narrow political agenda that this minister is seeking to promote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has sought to attack the overwhelming majority of the constituents that she should be representing; that is, the overwhelming majority of Australians who actually participate in the public education institutions of this country. In fact, what we have from this minister is ignorance and contempt. She has relied upon unpublished and qualified ABS data, advice which her own department has told her is not up to scratch, which she should not use in the way she has. Try as she might today to backtrack from her deplorable attitudes, we see her prejudice which is clearly against public education. We see before us a minister who is exposed as being ignorant and offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in which this minister is purporting to represent the interests of education in this country, is relying on the time honoured defence that the minister has been misrepresented, and she has done that again and again here. She has to come in here to apologise on a regular basis. How long before we see yet another apology about her offensive remarks, which we all know have been widely and roundly condemned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been condemned by Liberal politicians themselves. I quote the ACT Liberal MLA, Louise Littlewood who has written that she found Senator Vanstone's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remarks `not only offensive but extremely shallow'. We have seen Judith Hancock, the Chairwoman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, describe Senator Vanstone's comments as `unfortunate and poorly advised'. Duncan Stalker, the National President of the Australian Secondary Principals Association, has rejected Senator Vanstone's comments as `statistically inaccurate and absolute nonsense'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sick and tired of the school system which is admired throughout the world being blamed by the Government for their own lack of planning and mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Parents and citizens associations right around the country have expressed outrage. The New South Wales Parents and Citizens Federation has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone clearly does not believe that she represents the 70% of Australian children who seek their education in government school systems and she is prepared to compromise their life opportunities in the pursuit of her clear desire to advantage the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Minister of Education in New South Wales has plainly pointed out the obvious fact that this is the most savage attack upon one of the nation's great institutions and systems of schooling. He stated that she has `undermined community confidence in the system of schooling that the vast majority of Australians attend'. Dick Shearman of the Independent Education Union has made the point that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children from privileged backgrounds who go to elite private schools live in areas of low unemployment . . . Children in Catholic schools may have equal problems finding work&mdash;depending on where they live. You can't say it's because there is something wrong with the education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is quite clearly what the minister has sought to imply in this speech. Senator Vanstone conveniently fails to address the fundamental issue of the relationship between social class, social privilege and social disadvantage. Those are the fundamental principles which she has failed to address. She seeks to rely on the rhetoric of choice. She seeks to imply, somehow or another, that there should be equality, while she promotes inequality.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5700">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am somewhat reminded, whenever I look at Senator Vanstone and her junior minister, Dr Kemp, of George Orwell who brought to us the whole notion of newspeak. We have from this minister the concept of doublethink. The minister seeks to hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously. She tries to present to us the notion that she accepts both of them. What you see is a minister who has quite clearly misunderstood the very principles on which she is supposed to govern; that is, a commitment to defend public education and to defend the important role played by government in promoting public education and the critical role it plays in terms of our society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister calls upon statistics which ACER has clearly demonstrated have failed to take into account three fundamental principles, the first of which is that a smaller proportion of students from non&hyphen;government schools seek employment after year 12, the rest going directly into further education. The second point which she has failed to acknowledge is that student cohorts in government and non&hyphen;government school systems differ in the ways in which they influence employment outcomes; that is, in terms of their socioeconomic status. The third point which she fails to acknowledge is that there are marked regional variations in unemployment rates in terms of government and non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a deplorable attitude which is being expressed by this government in its approach to education. The minister says that there is more money spent in education. What she fails to point out to the Senate&mdash;a failure that her own department has acknowledged in submissions to the Senate committees&mdash;is that some $270 million is being cut from the budget in terms of moneys that otherwise would have been spent as a result of the direct policies of this government. If you include the $400 million that is taken away from the states through the general assistance grants, the figure is much larger. This government has quite clearly engaged not only in doublespeak but in doublethought. The government has failed to live up to its fundamental obligations to this society.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a generation, perhaps throughout this century, we have heard all governments express this view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Government financial support for schooling has so far been about providing opportunities for all young Australians which ensure that they have life chances not fettered by the circumstances of their birth.</PARA>

What it is moving away from is the normal principles of a universally high quality education system that values access and equity and inclusiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have is, in fact, an understanding by this government that for them choice means that, if you have the money, you get what you want. If you have not, you do without. What you have, I might suggest to you, is as a supporter of parent choice once stated. This was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the New Schools Policy</EMPHASIS> in April last year by McKinnon. The supporter made this point:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to start off by saying that Senator Carr is living in the 1940s and 1950s. I presume that that is where he has been left with his left-wing Labor views: that members of the coalition think that everything that is private is good and everything that is public is bad. That is the old rhetoric of the 1940s 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5701"> and 1950s loony left, and we have Senator Carr still living it. You find that the two major speakers, Senator Carr and Senator Faulkner, are from the Left. Where are the Right? They are not there. They do not want to take on this issue. They are reliving the old debate about the private school system versus the public school system that was going on with the DOGS and other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could have predicted what Senator Allison was going to come in and say. If you look at her speech on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill, you know exactly what she thinks about private schools. This is what she said when speaking on this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to go down in history as being part of a government which places the interests of small, fundamentalist and extreme schools at the expense of Australia's public schooling system, then by all means vote for this bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You can imagine the reaction of the Jewish, Anglican, Christian community and Lutheran schools and some of the small Catholic schools that I visit. They were flabbergasted that in federal parliament they were being depicted as `fundamentalist' and `extreme'. We knew exactly what she was going to say. That just puts on the record and reminds people of where Senator Allison was coming from about private schools. So she should not come in here and say that. It is the pot calling the kettle black. It was totally predictable what she would say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Vanstone has said over and over again, both inside and outside this chamber, is that schools, irrespective of whether they are private or public, need to be training young people for life, work and vocation. She has argued over and over again that a significant proportion of young people at both state and non&hyphen;government schools will not go to university and that some schools were letting young people down by not giving them vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone has also been very critical about the ideological push by Labor of downgrading and closing schools which were vocationally oriented. She said that gone are the days when young people could leave school at 14, get a job in a bank and work 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their way up to being the managing director of the bank. Those days are gone. She is also saying that gone are the days when it was okay to educate young people in some of the manual trades, that jobs have changed and that IT, hospitality and other service industries are the areas where young people need training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government, Labor had a scheme, the jobs pathway guarantee scheme, which was a pilot scheme. They had budgeted $2 million for this scheme. Had they begun to realise that there was a problem with vocational education? Do you know how much they had spent in their 1995&hyphen;96 budget? They had spent only $0.5 million. They had not got into it. It was in disarray and was disorganised. Minister Vanstone organised the restructuring of that program to tackle its shortcomings. She expanded the program at a sustainable rate, providing $2.9 million last financial year and $3 million this financial year. It was in disarray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison said that she had read Senator Vanstone's speech&mdash;and I believe her&mdash;but we did not hear one of the people on the other side say that they had read the whole of her speech. The emphasis in her speech was about the need to get schools to respond to the needs of their students, and that we were working hard to achieve that. The upgrading of the jobs pathway guarantee scheme was one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her speech, Senator Vanstone did not pull out a private school as an example. The only school she pulled out as an example was a state school in South Australia&mdash;a school that was achieving the sorts of goals that she expects of all schools, whether they be state or non&hyphen;government. She highlighted the achievement of one state school, because it was from her state. She did not choose to highlight a private school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As she said, how can you stand here and condemn her and say that she was slamming all government schools? In fact, the very example she used was of a school that was achieving the aims that she wants to achieve; that is, getting young people job ready, being flexible, building vocational training into the school program and building in a system that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5702"> does not lock in students. You need to leave open as many doors as possible so that, if they train down one pathway towards university, they should be able to then go into vocational education or vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't that what everyone wants for their children? The doors should be left open so that they can go into higher education or vocational training. That is the sort of flexibility Senator Vanstone is expecting in the schools and is working towards. She was not about damning government schools. As she pointed out, she was not in any way underestimating the dedication of people who are responsible for the education of about 70 per cent of our young people. I reiterate, she pulled out one example and that example was of a state school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I said, if they had bothered to read the whole speech, which they did not bother to do, and had not just relied on media reports and a single quote, they would have realised that the focus of the minister's speech was on the role of vocational education. She pointed out that the youth labour market had undergone permanent change and she did not blame schools for current levels of unemployment. If the blame lies anywhere, it lies at the feet of those on the other side who have the gall to pull us up for what we are doing about young people and what we are doing about overcoming the legacy that Labor left us. They left us a legacy of entrenched youth unemployment. They left us a legacy of the apprenticeship scheme in shambles. They left us a legacy of no hope for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp, the two ministers, are doing is to inject hope, to inject into both state and non&hyphen;government schools a system which responds to the real needs of young people in terms of vocational education and training, towards post&hyphen;secondary education. That is what she is on about. She was not about slamming government schools, and to construe her speech in that way is totally unacceptable and wrong. I would have thought that the opposition could have focused on some of the positive things that are happening rather than carping, as they do all the time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 seeks to adjust for price movements the 1998 amounts payable to higher education institutions under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals and special capital projects and to the open learning organisation. This bill seeks to give effect to the restructuring and the rationalisation plans announced in the budget. It introduces a discount of 25 per cent for up-front HECS payments of some $500 or more from 1988. It also seeks to streamline arrangements for student debts under HECS or the open learning deferred payment schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5704">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the surface this is a bill that merely adds an additional $9.6 million for 1998 on current legislated amounts. But the truth of the matter is that it hides the true impact of this government's unprecedented assaults on our nation's university sector. It hides the savage attack on the rights of thousands of Australians, both young and old, who seek to gain the benefits of a university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Senator Kemp has come into the chamber and I have no doubt that he will be looking with some mirth at the predicament of Senator Vanstone, Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in these difficult times. I am sure that family commitments here would not override his fundamental loyalty to cabinet and government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp would also be only too well aware that this bill has to be viewed in light of the budget decisions taken both last year and of course this year. In last year's budget the government announced that it was cutting $624 million from the operating grants of universities, $215 million from discretionary funds of universities, and $1.13 billion in savings as a result of its various savings measures that it was seeking to make as a result of the changes to its HECS arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's budget dealt a savage blow to education&mdash;a blow which could have lessened if this minister had been prepared to stand up and defend her portfolio and the interests of education within the ERC rather than kowtowing to the destructive demands of the various economic ministers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the minister would be aware of is that the fundamental fact in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this debate is that the cuts to higher education can only be viewed as a damning indictment of the incompetence of the minister in a government that has absolutely no commitment to social equality, to the rights of ordinary citizens or to the obligations for the future development of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the minister promised that there would be no bad news for education in the budget. Amongst the platter of bad news it has been revealed that a further one per cent cut to the operating grants would apply in the year 2000, which is a further $47.3 million taken away from universities. The minister has tried to claim that the savings were small. Remember she lectured the vice chancellors that they could not be expected to be immune from expenditure cuts. She is now describing these cuts as `the removal of promised growth in the forward estimates' and calling Labor's forward estimates `not a credible base against which education expenditure can be measured'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the basis on which universities were asked to plan. It was the basis on which universities were told the future growth would be funded. But, of course, this is a minister that overturns those commitments. There have indeed been massive cuts to the education sector. No matter how she tries to dress it up, she cannot hide that fundamental fact. The talk of the forward estimates brings me to this fundamental point: it highlights a great concern to the universities&mdash;that the stability of funding and the future basis of planning is dependent upon stability of funding and the commitments of government actually being honoured. This is a government that has failed that basic test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognised this need and indeed legislated for the funding of universities to be on a rolling triennium basis. Before the election, the coalition committed itself to continue the rolling triennium funding arrangements, but this promise went the way of those of the operating grants and of not changing the HECS arrangements midstream. It was quite simply dumped by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labor's last budget in 1995, it legislated funding for universities to cover 1996, 1997 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5705"> and 1998. In the two budgets since the election, however, there has been no move by the coalition government to provide the base funding beyond 1998. This raises the question about what other unpleasantness this government has in store for the higher education sector in this country. Can we expect that the West review will in fact bring forward new measures and new acts of vandalism to be committed against the higher education sector? Will it be used as yet another excuse to find various budget measures to further hack into the higher education sector in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extremely worrying time for universities and for university administrators who are trying to plan ahead to cope with the already drastic cuts that have been announced. Clearly there is a lack of certainty and a lack of clarity about what the government actually stands for in relation to the forward projections and where the money will come from to fund the necessities of the higher education sector. But what we have in this bill is a measure by this government to rationalise, to cover up and to try to put a bandaid over the enormous scars and cuts that have been left by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding cuts and a lack of planning provisions are forcing universities to change their priorities away from the quality of the education provision towards the need to raise money; turning universities away from being education centres into being businesses. Bit by bit, they are losing their status as public institutions serving the educational needs of this country. They are increasingly becoming privatised enterprises intent upon building profits. Universities are increasingly acting as big business and their need for funds subsumes all other priorities, to the detriment of Australian students who they are supposed to be serving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the coalition came to office we have seen some 2,000 jobs lost in this sector. Tutorials have begun to disappear and have been replaced by so&hyphen;called optional study sessions for which universities can and do charge. We have seen the recent decision of the University of New South Wales to close the St George campus and to close the teacher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education campus. We have seen Ballarat University merge with the School of Mines. We have seen faculties being shrunk and courses eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chair of the government's own review, Mr West, has acknowledged that funding cuts had already hurt universities. The Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, in its submission to the West review, called for an increase in government funding for higher education of over 20 per cent. The Business&hyphen;Higher Education Round Table, which includes the head of many of Australia's leading companies, warned in its submission to that review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The round table members went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutions are struggling to find investment capital for new technologies and teaching materials, to restructure their physical and staff resources to meet new demands. A significant increase in institutional funding to assist in this restructuring and reinvigorating process is needed and justified. Government funding will have to provide the major source.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Certainly the government is clearly not listening to such views. Whilst universities are struggling to meet new challenges, the government of the day is blithely marching ahead with major funding cuts, oblivious to and unconcerned about the potential harm to this country's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, the 1997&hyphen;98 budget and this bill bring no comfort whatsoever. The government announced in the budget that it would provide $26 million over four years to help universities to restructure and rationalise. This is of course code for what it is really trying to do, and that is to call upon the universities to cope with massive funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this amount not reflected in the additional expenditure provided by this bill? Because even the rationalisation money is offset by yet another expenditure cut, the ending of the Commonwealth industry places scheme. The CIPS scheme is a highly successful program in encouraging industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5706"> investment in higher education. By 1999, CIPS would have been supporting about 4,700 full&hyphen;time university places Australia wide with a large number concentrated at Charles Sturt, Deakin and Swinburne universities. This was supposed to be a budget for the regions, but it has been bad news for regional universities like Charles Sturt where some 200 jobs are likely to be lost as a result of the ending of the CIPS program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional and newer universities have been hit hard by this government's decision to allow full up&hyphen;front fees for Australian undergraduates. The `sandstone' universities, which can trade on their reputation, at least in the short term, are tying up their fees option as quickly as they can. They are trying to do it to provide additional sources of funding which have been lost from government sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gavin Brown, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Sydney, said on Sydney radio earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the only mechanism left to fill the huge funding gap which has been bequeathed to us all by Amanda Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I remind the Senate that recently the RMIT in Melbourne also introduced up&hyphen;front fees. Again, the vice&hyphen;chancellor is quoted as saying that they had no choice in the matter because they had to fill the funding gap left by this government. What you see is a university sector in complete chaos with occupations, demonstrations and a return to the period of the past when there was no security, no sense of quality emerging and no sense of national leadership. This government is always looking backwards, and this is yet another case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For other universities, the outlook has been even more bleak. A bleak future for universities equals a similarly bleak one for Australian students and those whose parents do not have a spare $100,000 to spend on a full fee university education. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of La Trobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, has voiced a clear warning about the direction of Australian universities under the Howard government. He has predicted that the ability to pay will carry greater weight than academic merit for university enrolments, resulting in a fall in the quality of education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation's largest university, Monash University, like so many others, has no faith that this government will reverse its funding cuts or provide funding security for the future. Monash University has just developed a five&hyphen;year plan that includes $20 million per year to be raised from fee&hyphen;paying Australian undergraduate students. We see in that plan that there are in fact fewer places available for Victorian students&mdash;domestic students&mdash;as the university swings away its resources to try to tap into what it sees as a lucrative Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The driving force behind the plans of Monash University is not the quality of service it can provide to Australian students but rather the need to expand its income by 60 per cent from overseas students on top of the $20 million from the fee&hyphen;paying Australian students. Monash developed this plan to reduce its reliance upon federal government funding from the current 50 per cent of operating revenue to 40 per cent by the year 2002. This is clearly an ominous sign for the university sector and should set alarm bells ringing for all people who believe that it is in this nation's interest to have a strong, publicly funded higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see that this government is intent on creating two tiers of university access&mdash;one for the wealthy who, even if they underperform at school, can get a place at university by paying up&hyphen;front fees, and one for the others who are left out because of the way tertiary education has been wound back by this backward looking government. The University of Western Sydney has recently reported that 15 per cent of its students have now been discouraged from pursuing a university education. I noticed a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday which highlighted a DEETYA study that showed that 10 per cent of mature age students had in fact been discouraged as a result of the changes to the higher education contribution scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By creating two tiers of university access, the Howard government is adding to the inequality and the fragmentation of our society. In May, the Anglican Social Responsibilities Committee of Melbourne called the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5707"> introduction of up-front fees `a deliberate shift away from a commitment to . . . an egalitarian society'. In its submission to the West review, the church committee also said it was `almost certain that a free market in education will in time weaken faculties and/or departments and/or universities which are already relatively impoverished'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, of course, takes a different view. She has compared universities to a used car saleyard saying that some degrees are worth the price of a used Commodore. In truth, however, universities do not work effectively as an open market. Education is far more important than to be treated as a mere commodity, and this is something Mr Roderick West has noted. On 28 May this year, he was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's no doubt about it, there's such a strong link between higher education participation and expenditure and economic and social wellbeing. So there are very compelling arguments for continuing substantial public support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, the minister had someone go around and tap him on the shoulder and made sure that those sorts of views were recanted. But I still believe that is essentially the view Mr West holds himself, that after travelling this country he understands the depth of feeling on this issue and understands the importance of public investment in higher education. The Business&hyphen;Higher Education Round Table has also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That foundation of national intellectual capital will continue to demand (and justify) substantial public funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a further requirement for continued, robust government support for higher education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet this government is taking us down the American path. It is seeking to introduce the user pays commercial principles and, of course, on a two-tiered social basis. This bill also introduces a 25 per cent discount for partial up-front HECS payments of $500 or more. Currently, the 25 per cent discount applies only to payments in full. This measure is separate from the 15 per cent discount which applies to voluntary payments of $500 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or more on HECS debts already incurred. Labor supports this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the differential HECS scheme introduced by this government of a full up-front payment for one student could represent only a partial payment for another student depending on the area of study, this would clearly be an inequitable arrangement. However, there are a few very important points to be made. One is that the cost to the government of this measure is estimated to be only $6.6 million over the next four years. The government has admitted in its description of this measure in budget paper (No. 2) that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this initiative has a small cost, there are gains to the government in terms of net lending for HECS in the early years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This tiny additional expenditure must be viewed against last year's budget cuts which saw $1.130 billion pulled out of government expenditure on HECS over the four years&mdash;a massive impost on students and one which has already had a negative impact on access for people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the discount introduced by the bill favours those who already have the capacity to pay at least a $500 up-front fee. It does nothing for those who are unable to put together such a sum. This budget does nothing to reverse or change in any way the damage done in last year's budget to student access through the enormous cuts through HECS and, of course, the changes to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of increased course costs of up to 125 per cent, the lowering of the HECS payment threshold for some from $8,000 below average weekly earnings and the substantial reduced access to student income support can be seen in the fall in application of university entrants, which we have seen this year. Figures released by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs show a 3.4 per cent decline in applications Australia-wide. We have seen the massive disincentive that such measures have already applied, particularly for mature age groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as extraordinary that, given this evidence, this government still insists on suggesting that the higher education sector is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5708"> thriving. I suppose you could tell the students at the RMIT that the higher education sector is thriving. You could tell those who have been forced to occupy the buildings at RMIT that the higher education sector is thriving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the measures taken by this government, you see a massive introduction of inequality. The opposition believes that there should be a second reading amendment carried by the Senate on these matters. Such an amendment may read:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Beecroft is in use for an average of 120 days per year. While levels of activity may increase as the Anzac Class ships enter service, it is believed that any increase beyond the 120 days would be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes. Closure of the Beecroft Peninsula is done to ensure public safety. (See also answer to question 1 above). The Range is open to the public on all NSW school and public holidays, and generally weekends outside the holiday period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closing the Range also allows Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service environmental managers to conduct activities which normally could not be undertaken when the Range is open to the public. For example, the Range was closed for three weeks in March 1996 and two weeks in March 1997 (including weekends) to enable a strategic vertebrate pest control program (Operation Restoration) to be conducted using poison baits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Department of Defence is committed to maintaining the Aboriginal heritage values of Beecroft Peninsula and has undertaken a number of management initiatives to ensure their protection. Navy liaises with representatives of the Jerrinja Local Aboriginal Land Council (JLALC) to determine the most appropriate ways in which sites can be protected and the cultural values interpreted. Two members of the Jerrinja community are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employed as Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service Rangers on Beecroft Peninsula. They provide a unique insight into aboriginal issues pertinent to the Range and provide advice on all Defence activities which may effect any sites of spiritual or cultural significance. Defence is very receptive to such advice and activities are modified accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All live firing activities are restricted to the Impact Area which occupies 400 hectares, or 10 percent, of Commonwealth owned land on Beecroft Peninsula. Following notification by the Jerrinja community in 1986, the symbolic and mythological value of the "Drum and Drumsticks" group of islets was recognised. Consequently, this rock formation is excluded from the Impact Area. Members of the JLALC have identified as sacred sites "Devils Hole", 1.2 km south of the Impact Area, and rock art sites at "Gum Getters Gully", 0.6km north of the Impact Area. No sacred sites have been identified within the Impact Area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All land based Defence training exercises are assessed for potential environmental impact by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service environmental managers, prior to their approval. No Defence training activities are permitted near areas of natural or cultural significance. All Defence personnel undertaking training activities are briefed on areas of cultural significance by Aboriginal Ranger staff employed with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the environmental management and advisory service provided for the Beecroft Weapons Range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) My response to question 7 addresses the protection by the Department of Defence of sacred and significant Aboriginal sites. In regard to the Defence Forces of other countries, Australia has defence treaty obligations and agreements with allied and friendly nations regarding the use of weapon ranges. Such agreements ensure reciprocal ADF access to overseas facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Yes. Environmental management on Beecroft Peninsula aims to ensure rare and endangered fauna species are protected and monitored for adverse impacts arising from Defence as well as public activities. The Department of Defence is well aware of the high profile of the Beecroft Peninsula and actively seeks to ensure the values, for which the Peninsula is noted, are maintained and protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foxes and feral cats are recognised as potentially significant introduced predators and are known to impact upon native wildlife at Jervis Bay. Operation Restoration aims to reduce the population of these predators on Beecroft Peninsula to such low numbers that their impact upon native wildlife is negligible. This will then allow the re&hyphen;introduction of such native species as the bandicoot and potoroo. Both Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and naval personnel are actively engaged

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The Minister met recently to discuss issues pertaining to Beecroft Peninsula with the Federal Member for Gilmore. The Minister is aware that the Member for Gilmore has visited Beecroft Peninsula and has made positive comments about Defence's custodianship of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) Beecroft Peninsula is required by the ADF for training purposes. The nature of the activities which occur on the peninsula necessitate the provision of safety buffer zones. These ensure that the land remains free of urban and pastoral expansion and experiences only restricted public access. There is little doubt historically that the reservation of Beecroft Peninsula and its management for Defence purposes have been the principal reasons that it remains in a substantially natural condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) The source document from which the question has been drawn is an internal document expressly prepared for the development of RAN environmental management policy and plans. The question relates to one of 292 questions included in an environmental checklist developed to survey environmental issues relevant to Naval activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first instance the results of the checklist were used to prepare the widely acclaimed Australian Book of Reference (ABR 6111) RAN Environmental Policy Manual, Volumes 1 and 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the second instance the results were published as the RAN State of the Environment Report (RAN SoER) 1995, providing evidence of the Navy's good intent to correct any outstanding environmental management issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The checklist not only provided data for the development of two very important environmental base&hyphen;line documents for the Navy, but also provided a useful educational tool for the personnel of the ships and establishments involved in the survey. It was in fact a self audit of environmental management issues. That a number of issues were reported as `not identified' or `not being managed' meant that improvements to the existing management programs could be made to rectify the situation. It did not mean that nothing was being done. Beecroft Peninsula has had a Land Management Plan since 1986 and this was recently replaced with the Jervis Bay Naval Environmental Management Plan in October 1996. The new plan being an example of the Navy's continual improvement with respect to environmental policy. Throughout this period the Australian Nature Conservation Agency (now Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service) Rangers were employed to manage the peninsula on behalf of the Navy. They have provided an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> excellent environmental management and protection service to the Navy during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995 RAN SoER did not `fail' to identify the issue in question. On the contrary, the purpose of the checklist achieved its purpose in identifying areas for management action/improvement. As a result of the data provided by the checklist, policy advice on the matter of `protection of native fauna from bushfires' is now provided in the ABR 6111, RAN Environmental Policy Manual., Volume 1, Chapter 6, titled Fire Management. Section 6.2 refers to Protection of Assets and Natural Areas. Additionally, the Jervis Bay Naval Environmental Management Plan provides specific advice on these issues in Part 3, Program 3.4, Fire Management; and Program 3.5, Terrestrial Flora and Fauna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Jervis Bay Naval Environmental Management Plan also calls for the employment of an Environmental Manager for the Jervis Bay region. That position was advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette on 01 May 97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the Navy has a good history with respect to the reduction of fire hazards and the prevention of fire. Research into the Beecroft fire regime was completed under contract to Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service on behalf of the Navy. There are also long standing arrangements between the State, local and Naval fire fighters for the suppression of fires on Beecroft Peninsula. With respect to botanical issues, extensive work has been completed on the peninsula that gives the Navy and Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service a good understanding of the fire regime and the complexity of the local flora. All of these issues are further addressed in the Jervis Bay Naval Environmental Management Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence, in cooperation with the contracted environmental managers, seeks to reduce the incidence of fires arising from either Defence activities or from other events (such as lightning strikes or wildfires). No bombardment of any kind is permitted during a Total Fire Ban. During periods of extreme or high fire danger, and whenever the drought index is at or above 40 points, the use of illuminants is prohibited. Similarly, when a moderate fire danger exists, the use of illuminants is prohibited if the wind exceeds 10 knots from the east or 20 knots from the south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Beecroft Weapons Range fire management plan for the Peninsula has been prepared under the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service contract by the former Fire Control Officer for the Shoalhaven region. This plan prescribes ecological burning regimes which are designed to protect the natural biodiversity of the Peninsula. Projects under the Research and Surveys Program have provided considerable information on the effects of fire upon Beecroft flora and fauna. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5714">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in 1995 the CSIRO Division of Entomology was contracted to undertake an investigation of the short term effects of fire on invertebrates in the coastal heathland on the Peninsula. The survey revealed a high invertebrate species diversity, reflecting the highly diverse vegetation characteristic of heathland sites. Two new species of Collembola (Springtails) were recorded, both of which may be specific to the Jervis Bay region. The consultants made a series of recommendations from this survey which related directly to fire management. These have been incorporated into the fire management plan.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fire management plan was prepared in 1996 which investigated and assessed fire history on the Beecroft Weapons Range. This report concluded that the primary land use has not adversely impacted on the vegetation communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vegetation survey was prepared in 1994 which concluded that the vegetation communities on the Range were diverse and in relatively good condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a June 1996 report to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, concerning the conservation and management of the ground parrot, the survey identified the Peninsula as having one of the highest mainland densities of the species on the eastern seaboard. The report suggested this may be due to the varying age mosaic of the heath created by small patchy burns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low reptile and amphibian species diversity identified in a survey conducted in 1995, was attributed to both relatively infertile soils and a narrow isthmus connecting Beecroft Peninsula with the mainland, effectively restricting immigration.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the impact of aircraft noise on birds, the Navy has an ongoing operational requirement in the Jervis Bay area and a certain amount of noise is an integral part of that activity. Noise was discussed as an issue during the development of the Jervis Bay Naval Environmental Management Plan but there is no evidence to suggest that the noise from Naval operations over Beecroft Peninsula is having an adverse effect on bird colonies or rookeries in the area. The Beecroft Peninsula has abundant bird life including large birds of prey. Additionally, Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has implemented a very successful threat abatement plan to reduce the impact of introduced species on the native fauna on the peninsula.

For scientific and operational reasons, a more extensive upgrading would be necessary, involving reactor neutron beam and radioisotope production systems also. The cost would depend on the extent of the work which was undertaken.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The report of the RRR provides a useful background for Government decisions on the question of an on&hyphen;going research reactor capability in Australia, but its recommendations and conditions are not pre&hyphen;requisites for those decisions. The RRR did not say in its report in 1993 that a case had not been made for a replacement reactor. It accepted that the Government might want to make a positive decision about a new reactor for national interest reasons. It also gave conditional approval for a positive decision after about five years (see also response to part 21(b), below).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Synroc has been tested in a number of countries, and is widely recognised as a highly effective medium for the long term immobilisation of radioactive waste. However, as yet, it has not been used commercially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) This is one of the options which the Government has under consideration at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) The Government is considering options for the future of neutron science and technology in Australia. If it were to decide on a new research reactor, the Government would seek a small reactor of a modern design. Details would depend on the bid of the successful tenderer against the required technical specifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) This is one of the options which the Government has under consideration at present. A plant to process spent nuclear fuel in Australia would be functional only if it included a facility to immobilise intermediate level radioactive waste products. That facility would be a synroc plant. The cost, including the synroc plant, would be dependent upon the outcome of design studies, and a competitive tendering process. The existing synroc demonstration plant uses only non&hyphen;radioactive simulants of waste to develop and test process technologies for application to a variety of waste streams. It will continue to be used as long as it serves a useful purpose in developing these technologies. Hence, the synroc component of a spent fuel processing plant would be separate from, and in addition to, the present plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) Current Commonwealth legislation allows for on&hyphen;site reprocessing and long term waste storage at Lucas Heights. However, reprocessing would be subject to a permit being issued under the provisions of the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5720">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15) Yes. Transportation can be undertaken safely if the relevant international and national standards are satisfied. National standards are applied in all Commonwealth, State and Territory jurisdictions and, for many years now, radioactive materials have been transported safely throughout Australia on a daily basis, in accordance with these standards. Many of the flights which leave Sydney each day, for example, carry packages of radioactive materials as part of their cargoes. Since 1990, more than 250,000 packages of radioactive materials have been transported within Australia in the Commonwealth jurisdiction alone. It is not practicable to list the occasions when radioactive materials have been transported in Australia in this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(16) The recent environmental impact statement (EIS) of the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) on the Return of Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel did not say that high level waste would be returned to Australia. The EIS makes it clear that, if spent fuel rods were repatriated to the United States, no radioactive waste would be returned to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(17) (a) Yes. However, the US Government has decided to continue to reprocess in excess of 188 tonnes of aluminium&hyphen;clad research reactor fuel from US and Taiwanese reactors which has deteriorated too far to continue to be stored safely over the next decade. Reprocessing is considered by the US Government to be the most appropriate technology for stabilising this material (see DOE/EIS&hyphen;0220, October 1995, Interim Management of Nuclear Materials (IMNM) EIS; decision was announced by USDOE on 19 December 1995). Also, the EIS to which Senator Stott Despoja refers makes explicit provision for the option of reprocessing the foreign research reactor fuel returned to the United States under the return of spent fuel policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Government is in agreement with the thrust of the US Government's policy. Nevertheless, the spent fuel rods in storage at Lucas Heights cannot be stored indefinitely, as their aluminium cladding may corrode leading to the escape of radioactive material. The most responsible way of conditioning these rods for the long term is to extract the uranium, which is re&hyphen;useable as either reactor fuel or for radiopharmaceutical production, and to encapsulate the waste in a form which is suitable for ongoing storage or disposal. If a plant were to be established in Australia to process the spent fuel, it would be subject to the strictest international safeguards regimes. Indeed, the continued stockpiling by Australia of spent high enriched uranium (HEU) fuel rods could appear to other countries to be contrary to our strong stance on nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation. Reprocessing would make it possible to consume the HEU by recycling, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thereby reducing Australia's stockpile of this sensitive strategic material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(18) It will be many years before the return of the intermediate level radioactive waste from the spent fuel rods which were processed in the United Kingdom last year. The precise management arrangements will need to be addressed closer to the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, at this stage, Australia does not have a national storage facility for intermediate level radioactive waste. The Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste accepted, in principle, the Committee's recommendation for a national above ground storage facility for long lived intermediate level waste which is not suitable for near&hyphen;surface disposal. The waste to be returned from the United Kingdom is of this type. Establishment of such a storage facility will be raised with the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. Consideration will be given to the possible co&hyphen;location of the storage facility with a national near&hyphen;surface repository for low level and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level radioactive waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) Full international safeguards arrangements would apply to uranium recovered from the processing of the Lucas Heights spent fuel rods.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(21) (a) The Government has been keeping under review the recommendations and conditions set out in the report of the Research Reactor Review (RRR).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The RRR was established by the previous Government and reported to it. The report, in 1993, recognised that the Government might want to make a positive decision about a new reactor for the same reasons and in the same way as it does for defence and other national interest issues. It also said that there was no need to make a final decision immediately, and it set out a number of conditions which it considered, if satisfied, would make it appropriate for a positive decision to be made on a new reactor after about five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its response to the report, the previous Government said that it broadly accepted the RRR's findings. It kept HIFAR operating, and it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5721"> provided funding for the probabilistic safety assessment of HIFAR which is now nearing completion. It also accepted that a final decision on replacing HIFAR should be deferred for about five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the previous Government did not endorse the recommendation that work be commenced with a view to the establishment of a high level radioactive waste repository for the management of the spent nuclear fuel generated by HIFAR. Nor did it provide funds specifically for access for scientists to international advanced neutron scattering facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Government, also, does not accept the view of the RRR on the matter of a high level radioactive waste repository. Given the advice of the Nuclear Safety Bureau that a major upgrade of HIFAR's safety systems will be required by around 2003, and the lead times involved for reactor&hyphen;related construction/refurbishment activities, the present Government considers a decision should be taken as soon as possible on the question of an on&hyphen;going research reactor capability in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation regarding the conditions given in the report is outlined in detail in the response to Parliamentary Question No 561 (Hansard, 29 may 1997). Briefly, the present position is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the first condition related to what the RRR saw as a need for a high level waste repository to manage spent nuclear fuel. An alternative strategy, which will not result in the generation of high level radioactive waste, is being developed for the management of spent nuclear fuel;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the second condition related to spallation technology. This technology is still developing and, at this stage, does not meet Australia requirements for neutrons for both neutron beam science and for the production of radioisotopes. In short, the technology has not developed significantly since 1993. The RRR acknowledged that even if a spallation source were to be acquired, a reactor would still be needed for the production of radioisotopes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the third condition was that there had been no practical initiation of a cyclotron anywhere in the world to produce technetium 99&hyphen;m, the most commonly used radiopharmaceutical in nuclear medicine. The Government is not aware of the practical initiation of a cyclotron anywhere in the world today to produce technetium 99&hyphen;m, or of any plans to do so. Indeed, the Government understands that research to prove the concept has been scaled back considerably because results have not met expectations, and the utilisation of cyclotrons for the commercial production of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technetium-99m will not be practical in the foreseeable future;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fourth condition related to strong and diverse applications of neutron scattering. Between 1993 and 1996, the number of university research projects using HIFAR increased by about two&hyphen;thirds. Access to the key neutron scattering instruments on HIFAR was fully booked in 1993 and continues to be fully booked today even though data collection is much faster than in 1993. Further, there has been a trebling in the use of overseas neutron scattering facilities by Australia's top research scientists; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fifth condition was that the national interest remains a high priority, and that continues to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(22) As no decision has yet been taken on a replacement reactor, it is premature to consider siting issues. Nevertheless, if Australia were to acquire a small replacement research reactor, the site selected for it would need to satisfy a number of relevant technical and operational criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(23) Whatever decision the Government makes about an ongoing research reactor capability, the actions will be subject to the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator Allison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 June 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Why were the Federal Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs) to local government cut by $15 million in the 1997-98 federal budget and by $60 million over the next 4 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Does this mean that the 1995 Council of Australian Government's agreement to implement national competition policy, which states `the Commonwealth will maintain the real per capita guarantee of the FAGs pool', no longer applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) What consultation and negotiation took place with local government prior to the budget announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) What financial benefit will local government in Victoria, for instance, derive from the Commonwealth by implementing compulsory competitive tendering.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5724" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In 1997-98, the general purpose assistance entitlement for local government will be increased in line with the Consumer Price Index and hence be maintained in real terms. The estimated entitlement for 1997-98 is $1,213 million (excluding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adjustments for an overpayment in 1996-97 and an underpayment in 1995-96), an increase of $9.3 million on 1996-97. As shown on page 51 of 1997-98 Budget Paper No. 2, this represents an estimated saving of $14.7 million in 1997-98 against the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of general purpose assistance to local government is linked to the provision of financial assistance grants to the States and Territories through the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. This Act provides for the increase in general purpose assistance to local government to be determined in line with the underlying movement in general revenue assistance provided to the States and Territories. In 1997&hyphen;98 the increase in general purpose assistance to local government will be more commensurate with trends in general revenue assistance provided to the States taking into account the fiscal contributions which the States are making to the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, local government will continue to be relatively well treated by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the Agreement to Implement the National Competition Policy and Related Reforms, the Commonwealth agreed to maintain the real per capita guarantee of the State financial assistance grants pool on a rolling three year basis, subject to the States meeting their obligations under the Agreement. The Agreement states that local government will benefit from the link between the State and local government financial assistance grants pools. The Government's determination of the 1997-98 general purpose assistance entitlement for local government is in accordance with this link as established by the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. This link does not require that changes in local government funding be in direct proportion to changes in the State financial assistance grants but, as noted above, that they be in line with the underlying movement in general revenue assistance provided to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The decision relating to local government general purpose assistance was taken in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget context. Consistent with the nature of budget decisions, the measure was not discussed with local government prior to the Budget announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Local government will not derive financial benefits from the Commonwealth by implementing compulsory competitive tendering. However, local governments are generally likely to benefit due to better value for money outcomes where they participate in a competitive tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Competition Principles Agreement (CPA) provides that principles set out in the CPA will apply to local government, although they are not parties to the Agreement. Each State and Territory is responsible for applying the principles to local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5725"> government. The CPA does not refer to State or local government participation in competitive tendering. However, governments choosing to undertake competitive tendering must do so in a manner consistent with the principles of competitive neutrality.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by the Industry Commission that the answers to the senator's questions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Industry Commission has preliminary inquiry cost estimates available at present. (Final accounting will be reported in the usual way in the Annual Report.) The preliminary estimate of the non&hyphen;salary expenditure of the automotive inquiry is $204 700, which includes travel, printing, consultants and other costs. Expenditure on salaries and fees is estimated to be $793 000 (preliminary figure).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commission received evidence from 173 participants:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 152 organisations made submissions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 54 organisations attended public hearings; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 47 organisations attended round table discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the organisations that gave evidence at public hearings or round table discussions also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made submissions. In addition, the Commission gathered information from visits and published reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Commission held seven days of public hearings. This does not include the round table discussions arranged with key participants for which public transcripts are also available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commission considered that the economic model used in the automotive inquiry should:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be based on a highly disaggregated industry structure to capture detailed industry linkages;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> include the economy's adjustment path over time to tariff proposals;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be capable of disaggregating the economy wide effects of tariff reductions down to the State level; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be able to be fully documented, allowing for greater transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only computable, general equilibrium model available in Australia that satisfies these criteria is the MONASH model, developed by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University. For this reason, the Commission contracted the Centre of Policy Studies to provide economic modelling for the automotive inquiry. The lack of suitable alternative models prevented the Commission from tendering out this work. The Commission was able to consider also three other modelling submissions, as well as critiques submitted on modelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commission paid $46 000 to the Centre of Policy Studies for the economic modelling work done for the automotive inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Commission has also contracted the Centre of Policy Studies to provide economic modelling for the textiles, clothing and footwear inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The same criteria as those used for the automotive inquiry guided the selection of economic models for the textiles, clothing and footwear inquiry. In addition, given the concentration of the TCF industry in some regional areas, the Commission considered it would be desirable if the model could disaggregate the national effects of tariff reductions down to a regional level. Only the MONASH model could meet all these criteria, and for this reason, the Commission was not in a position to tender out this work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) It is a common practice for the Commission to provide research and secretarial support for all Commissioners, including where Commissioners wish to express different views in inquiry reports. In accordance with this practice, the Chairman of the Industry Commission offered to assist Mr Ian Webber in the development of his minority report. Mr Webber declined the Chairman's offer. All Commissioners were given successive working 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5726"> drafts of material prepared in response to their comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) A complete list of the names of all parties who made submissions, or gave evidence at round tables and public hearings is provided in Appendix A of the Commission's final automotive report (copy attached).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many participants have provided their address on their public submission, and therefore their address is already in the public domain. For privacy reasons, the Commission would normally seek the permission of other participants prior to divulging their addresses. The Commission will facilitate access to this level of detail if required.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Appendix outlines the inquiry process and the organisations and individuals that participated in the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 12 August 1996 the Commission received the terms of reference for this inquiry into the Australian automotive industry. The reference directed the Commission to report within nine months on assistance arrangements for the automotive industry from January 2000. The reference also asked the Commission to report on a number of other matters, including the potential for further development of the industry, and measures which could be undertaken to remove impediments or otherwise contribute to the industry's efficiency. The full terms of reference are reproduced on page XVIII.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following receipt of the terms of reference, the Commission placed a notice in the national press inviting public participation in the inquiry and released an issues paper to assist participants in preparing their submissions. The Commission received 92 submissions prior to the draft report, and an additional 114 submissions following the draft report. A list of the parties that made submissions is provided in Section A.2.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission also held informal discussions with organisations, companies and individuals to gain background information and to assist in setting an agenda for the inquiry. Those visited by the Commission are listed in Section A.3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade union movement declined the personal offer made by the Chairman of the Commission to be involved in the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to inquiry time constraints, the Commissioners convened a number of round table discussions, rather than holding public hearings to gather information for the draft report. These discussions enabled the Commissioners to exchange views with small groups of key industry members on major issues. A transcript of the round tables was kept and made publicly available to maintain the transparency of the Commission's processes. Round table participants are listed in Section A.4.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission held public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide in late February and early March 1997, and received evidence from 54 organisations. A list of the parties that gave evidence at the public hearings is provided in Section A.5. A transcript of the public hearings was made publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission engaged the Centre of Policy Studies/Impact project at Monash University to assist it in modelling the economic effects of past and future developments in the automotive industry. No other consultants were engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer agreed to a two week extension of the reporting date for the inquiry to 26 May 1997, following a request by the Commission's Chairman, Mr Bill Scales. At that time the Commission was still waiting on the results of three separate modelling studies of the effects of proposed automotive industry tariff reductions. Given the high profile that some participants had placed on economic modelling, and given the late delivery of the studies, extra time was needed to thoroughly evaluate the various models.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="5733" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Minister for Justice" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, the question refers to research which is being conducted by Dr G A Wittert and his team at the University Department of Medicine, Royal Adelaide Hospital. Dr GA Wittert is studying the regulation of food intake, energy balance and fat storage in the Sminthopsis Crassicaudata (Fat&hyphen;tailed Dunnart). This project was originally to be under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken at the University of Adelaide, but it has moved to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This animal is a small marsupial native to Australia, which stores a large proportion of fat in the tail. Fat&hyphen;tailed dunnarts used in Dr Wittert's research project were bred at Animal Services, University of Adelaide, not obtained from the wild. This species is not listed as endangered or vulnerable in the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 Schedules 1, 2 and 3 May 1996. Two species of dunnarts are on this list: the Sminthopsis douglasi (Julia Creek Dunnart) is listed as endangered and the Sminthopsis psammophila (Sandhill Dunnart) is listed as vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The research into the regulation of fat stores is unique and feasible because of the characteristics of fat&hyphen;tailed dunnarts; that 25% of fat stores are in their tail. Tail removal is a fast simple procedure performed under anaesthesia. The tail removal procedure and condition of the animals has been found to be satisfactory by the veterinarian in charge of Animal Services at the University of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a)This research was funded through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Small Grant awarded in 1996 and is currently being funded by an ARC Large Grant for 1997&hyphen;1999 in the Biological Sciences field of research. The funding for each year is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1997: $55 000</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1998: $53 000</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1999: $51 000 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5734">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The ARC is funding this research because it will provide new basic knowledge. Currently, there is very little information about appetite regulation in marsupials and the research will provide integrated data about the interactions between food intake, fat storage and energy balance and the mechanisms by which these occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The value of the research is that it will provide basic knowledge about appetite regulation in marsupials and fat tailed dunnarts as well as an opportunity to focus international attention on Australian native wildlife. The proposed studies are likely to have direct application because factors that are shown to be important for appetite in such divergent species as Sminthopsis and rodents are also likely to be involved in regulating appetite in humans. The animals are bred primarily for research purposes and the findings may ultimately be of benefit to our understanding and continued preservation of the species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Ethics requirements for ARC grants have been met by the evaluation of the research by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee. Initial approval for this project was given on 13 April 1995 and approval for the continuation of this work at the Royal Adelaide Hospital was given by the Animal Ethics Committee on the 22 May 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aside from ethical evaluation, ARC Large Grants are also peer reviewed. The research project was assessed as outstanding by independent assessors (both Australian) and was subsequently recommended through the relevant ARC discipline panel and ultimately the ARC Research Grants Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assessors consider that the project is interesting, well designed, internationally competitive and will promote the use of a unique Australian marsupial in research relating to the biology of fat metabolism. Aside from examining an animal model for understanding weight regulation in humans, the project should provide a direct understanding of energy balance in a marsupial unique to Australia. It is relevant not just to medical scientists, but to zoologists and ecologists as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Whether the ban supersedes the ban in the lower court, is a matter for Indian law. I understand that the orders relate to separate cases and that it is not necessarily the case that the Supreme Court order supersedes the order made in the Delhi High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I have not seen the Indian Government's statistics covering trade in hazardous wastes. Australian Bureau of Statistics data indicate that in the calendar year 1996 Australian exports of lead acid battery waste to India amounted to 110 tonnes. It is not clear whether other Australian exports of lead wastes to India would be considered hazardous for the purpose of the Basel Convention. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5735">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Since the amendments to Australia's Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 commenced on 12 December 1996, no permits have been issued for the export of hazardous waste to India. Any exports prior to 12 December 1996 arose because of inadequacies at that time in Australia's hazardous waste laws. Exporters of battery waste were not legally obliged to seek a permit or inform the Australian Government of any trade in valuable hazardous recyclables and the Government had no legal authority to restrict or prevent these exports. The amendments to the Hazardous Waste Act require all exports of hazardous waste, including hazardous wastes such as lead acid battery scrap destined to recycling facilities, to be granted a permit prior to shipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Consistent with the requirements of the Basel Convention, Australia will not permit the export of hazardous wastes to Parties which have prohibited the import of such wastes. Environment Australia is currently clarifying the legal status, intent and scope of the Indian Supreme Court order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Any illegal exports of hazardous waste to India will be dealt with in accordance with the Hazardous Waste Act. Section 35 of the Act allows the Minister for the Environment to order that the waste be imported to Australia. Generally, in such instances, the import costs would be met by the exporter concerned and not the Australian Government.</PARA>
