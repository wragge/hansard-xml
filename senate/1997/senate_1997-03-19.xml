<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the comments made by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in his contribution to the debate on the amendments moved by Senator Allison, it is reasonable to address the fact that the minister quite specifically mentioned that his motivation for opposition to the amendments is one of allowing the carriers to be commercially driven in their developments and the extension of their infrastructure. Senator Margetts made the point quite specifically: whose interests does the minister have at heart?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I contend that this is precisely the role that the government should be taking with respect to providing guidance to carriers on indicating that cables should go underground. An amendment such as this, particularly with respect to the section relating to the objects and inserting an additional objects provision into the Telecommunications Act, fulfils quite clearly the role of government in this regard. Stating that the minister's concerns are primarily commercially driven flies in the face of this whole package of bills, which are to deregulate and to allow the carriers and, by virtue of the fact of their involvement, the market to determine what is a commercially viable and efficient outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A quite suitable role for government to take is to set in place an aim such as that defined in the Democrats' amendment to clause 3, page 3:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to promote the relocation of existing overhead cables, and the location of future cables, underground, wherever possible. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1758">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, I ask you quite specifically: do you believe that making an assertion of this kind is an appropriate role for government? In the context of that objective, do you believe that you are not placing any commercial imposition or otherwise on the telecommunications carriers? Indeed, even if you were, surely the role of government is to provide guidance to industry on the way we want the infrastructure to be developed, not because we are trying to be technology specific but because you have a social obligation to ensure that the concerns of all members of the community are addressed in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a private discussion with the Democrats about their amendments. Minister, I cannot see why the Democrat amendment 1 in document 404, which is down as (g) but I think actually should be (h), cannot go in the objects of the act, which are on pages 2 and 3 of the Telecommunications Bill 1996. As I said last night in the debate, all of those are to promote. They are objectives; they are not prescriptive in detail, in defining that certain things must be done by a certain date. However, I accept the comments made in the debate yesterday&mdash;and I have expressed this to the Democrats&mdash;about the package of amendments on this issue. Democrat amendment 7 seeks to insert the following provision:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">64A  Conditions about underground cables</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the object referred to in paragraph 3(2)(g) is attained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand from discussions with your own officers this morning that none of the other objectives has such a subsequent clause to say the minister must take all reasonable steps to attain any one of those objectives. Certainly, under Democrat amendment 8, if there is a contravention in this area the carrier could lose its licence. I understand from advice this morning that there is no penalty of losing your carrier licence in any of those other objectives to promote a range of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the opposition's viewpoint, we are sympathetic to the idea that what I think should be (h) rather than (g) should be included in the objectives on this issue. But we do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not support Democrat amendments (7) to (12) because we think it would be out of kilter to tie those penalties to one section of the objectives in the bill. We think that clearly there would be an imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, from the opposition's point of view, we put to you, Minister, and to the Democrats that we are willing to vote for Democrat amendment (1), even if you want to make suggestions about upgrading the wording. For example, I think it should say `telecommunications overhead cables'. I do not think we have the power, fortunately or unfortunately, when it comes to electricity cables. But we should make it clear that it is telecommunications cables we are talking about because that is what this bill is about. If you can get some other wording that you think satisfies some of your concerns about how it should be there to promote the objectives, then I think we in the Senate could get a good outcome here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Democrats accept the issue in regard to making this a penalty if you do not achieve the objectives&mdash;and it is unspecified as to how you achieve the objectives&mdash;and you can then actually lose your licence, I do not think that penalty should be tied to an object of the bill when I understand that no other object in the bill is tied specifically to the possible loss of carrier licence. There are other processes for that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I put that forward for both the government and the Democrats to see whether that is a compromise they can live with. I think it is a reasonable outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is inconceivable that anyone could seriously come into this chamber and put forward that proposition. Can I put it to you rather in these terms? To endorse an objects clause in legislation has to have some consequences, otherwise there is no point putting it there&mdash;it is not just Pollyanna. If you were able to wave a magic wand and say, `Look, we want these things underground so, bang, they are underground', and if it could be done cost free and overnight, of course in a perfect world that is what would happen.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that that is right. Really, that is where the fundamental sticking point arises. You assume that that is inherently desirable in social terms. You simply cannot have a social objective divorced from the economic and financial consequences. If you want to propose something that is relatively cost free and is inherently desirable, I do not have a problem with it. But if you propose something that could potentially cost&mdash;and you cannot dispute that it could potentially cost billions and billions of dollars to put cables underground throughout Australia, even in rural and remote areas where the local communities may be perfectly happy to have them above ground&mdash;it seems to me that you are simply abdicating your responsibility to make hard choices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Objectives are all about delivery, otherwise you are a hypocrite. If you say, `Well, my intention is to live a good life, but in fact I break every rule in the book', I say, `Well, why did you get out there and proclaim you are going to live the good life?' You might as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well shut up, do what you are going to do, and we will make our judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put an objects clause in legislation is to say that we think it is inherently desirable that all cables go underground as soon as possible. I do not know that that is inherently desirable when you have to make hard choices. If you are talking about billions and billions of dollars, is that necessarily the best way of spending that money when there are all sorts of other social obligations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine would no doubt say to you that there is a hell of a lot more you can do in Tasmania to assist that state to permanent economic viability than force people to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on undergrounding cables whether or not they want that to occur. And you can multiply that argument around Australia. So you cannot have an objects clause without consequences, otherwise you are being irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, once you proclaim that as your objective, it seems to me you are pre&hyphen;empting a whole range of very difficult issues&mdash;not just that you are expecting an open cheque and that you do not care what it costs. As I said to you yesterday, it may well be that this becomes an obsolete approach in a few years. If you have satellite delivered services, what the carriers might do is simply remove overhead cables and throw them away, yet you are saying it is an inherently desirable objective to put these things underground. So it does not follow. The proper way to go about it is not to rule out any of these possibilities but to have&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You pre&hyphen;empt the debate by saying it is inherently desirable to put everything underground. It is not inherently desirable; it is a matter of choices being made. That is why you have your inquiry; that is why you find out what it is likely to cost; that is why you work out who ought to contribute to that, and then you make the ultimate judgment. Are we prepared to see hundreds of billions of dollars on undergrounding cables rather than on hospitals, schools or whatever else has a greater claim on the public purse, or do we think this is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1760"> overwhelmingly important to the exclusion of those other priorities? I think that is a very difficult choice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you cannot ignore the purpose of an objects clause. It just seems to me that, if you put that in, you are at least binding yourself in a moral sense to going further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take your point at one level&mdash;the ultimately draconian penalty of removing a licence is far too extreme. But any penalty or any obligation to go further simply assumes that this is unarguably the right thing to do, and I simply do not accept that proposition at this stage. It may well emerge from the inquiry that it is going to cost only a few billion dollars, but I cannot believe it is going to cost any less than that. We have had estimates, as you know, of it costing up to $10 billion in Adelaide alone from ETSA.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know what you are going to say, but there is nothing else on the table that you can believe. I have had one of my colleagues come to me and say, `I think that is probably a bit exaggerated, because I have got an independent assessment from engineers who said that the cost in Sydney for undergrounding telecommunications would be only $5 billion.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sydney has a third of the population&mdash;particularly when you get beyond the metropolitan areas&mdash;and, on that basis, you would be talking about $15 billion or $20 billion. I am not prepared to proceed on the basis that it is inherently desirable to go underground wherever possible when you have those sorts of cost implications hanging over the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say by all means let us not sweep the thing under the carpet. We are very much committed to exploring all of these possibilities, and there are a lot of people who think it would make sense. They would rather we had been able to have them underground from the beginning, and I do not quarrel with that. There are many parts of Australia where they have been underground from the begin 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ning&mdash;in new subdivisions and elsewhere. But that is not the fact of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of life is that, under the 1991 regime and since that time, we have had quite a bit of overhead cabling. The issue now is this: do we put it underground, what will it cost and is that the best use of funds? I simply say that even an objects clause is a clear indication that it is inherently desirable. I think the jury must still be out on that issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.47 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to respond to a couple of points the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) made. The point is that we are in this situation because the choice has not been able to be made locally. The minister says that we cannot just assume this is the right way to go. Well, the government has assumed that overhead cabling is the right way to go. By its every action, it has facilitated and ensured that that is what has come to pass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that local communities&mdash;by virtue of the powers and immunities within the current act&mdash;have not been able to make that choice, it is incumbent on the government to take steps towards responding to the enormous amount of concern out there in local government and in the communities. We cannot measure that concern. There has not been a referendum produced on this issue. All we can go by is the response we have had, and I think that has been fairly conclusive. That response has come through local government in no uncertain terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been quite arbitrary of the government to make the decision that we should not go ahead with undergrounding on the basis of cost, yet we have seen, as the minister acknowledges, no reliable figures about what that actual cost would be. We also know, as I said yesterday, that the cost would have been quite low had Telstra chosen to go underground instead of overhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen figures elsewhere which indicate that undergrounding, whilst it might take a little longer, would not in fact be much more costly than overhead. It depends on where you are in Australia and it depends on what the long-term objectives of the relevant state government are. In Western Australia, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1761"> for instance, the state and local governments are committed to undergrounding all cabling&mdash;TV cabling and electrical cabling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is quite arrogant of the government to assume that it knows what is desirable, what is to be paid for and how it is to be done. We have seen this roll&hyphen;out of aerial cabling proceed apace without any debate about the desirability or otherwise of it being aerial. The amendments that have been put forward by the Democrats would at least go some way to taking that responsibility back at the federal level. Since it took the powers away from local communities in the first place, the federal government should take that responsibility and do something about it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a couple of brief comments. I really hope this whole debate in the committee stages of the bill is not taken up by arguments about projected costs of projected changes to infrastructure. Already the phrase `billions and billions of dollars' has been uttered by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) on far too many occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the government and the minister to remember the context in which this debate is occurring. We are talking about a deregulatory package of bills for the telecommunications industry. We are not currently discussing a prescriptive regulation. We are discussing a broad objective that seeks to offer guidance to the industry about the priorities that carriers should perhaps assess in making their decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept that arguments about projected costs of billions and billions of dollars and estimates by carriers, who have an obvious interest in such things not being put in the objectives, are reasons for us as a parliament to ignore the need for the insertion of those clauses. I do not believe the government can have it both ways in this bill. On the one hand, its deregulating allows for the market to prevail and competition to be implemented in an effective way and, on the other hand, it refuses to put in place broad objectives that do not prescribe, but do not seek either, to state the government's position, intent or objective, which is what we are discussing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I put it to you that you cannot have it both ways. We are talking about a deregulatory regime and we are currently debating an objective not a prescriptive regulation.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1761" TIME="9.52 a.m." SPEAKER="Schacht, Sen Chris" NAMEID="4J4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.52 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put forward that suggestion because I thought that it would be a not unreasonable compromise as to your concerns, particularly on what some call the black letter of the law about penalties, et cetera. The opposition would not support that, but we would support something else, even if you wanted to suggest a different form of wording to the Democrat amendment on what (g) or (h) should be in the objectives to promote in this area. I think the wording does need to be changed, but I left that, if you were willing to look at that and deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did that on the basis that through this bill overall the opposition's view is cooperation, being constructive and trying to reach agreement as far as possible. Yesterday on the issue of digital data capability it would have been much simpler for the opposition to stick to our black and white position against the government and then campaign strongly that you had dudded 400,000 potential rural subscribers from getting digital data capability when we were holding the purist position. In the discussions overnight and again this morning, an amendment will come forward which we as an opposition can support. It may not be 100 per cent the best political outcome in cynical terms for the opposition, but I think it is the best outcome for Australian telecommunications consumers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again I am putting to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) that as a compromise they put a form of words in the objectives to promote the vision. I know visions may not be a great thing to talk about anymore in politics and it may not even be politically correct to talk about visions, but I do think there should be an indication in our own telecommunications bill that this is a reasonable objective, without putting time scales, dates or levies on it in the objective at all. It is a message to the broader community that we are not just technical engineers, software developers and so on in telecom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1762"> munications, but that we do understand the broader urban and rural environment in which we operate and we do have environmental concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is concerned about the overall cost. I am not ignoring those comments. If you said, `We are going to start today undergrounding every cable in Australia', it would run into billions and, even starting today with every effort provided, it would take years to achieve. I accept that this has to be a program that may take a generation or more. If you say to the Australian community that we believe that is a useful objective, I think their response will be positive. For example, 25 or 30 years ago if you drove around the rural areas of Australia you saw along the sides of country roads endless wooden telephone poles in some states and iron telephone poles in other states. There were Telstra telephone lines and copper pairs running down the sides of the roads. In Gippsland, where I grew up on a dairy farm, Telstra's&mdash;or PMG as it then was&mdash;telephone lines were on one side of the road and there was electricity on the other. Everyone could trace their own pair all the way back to the telephonist&hyphen;operated local telephone exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 30 years off its own bat Telstra has overwhelmingly undergrounded all of those rural cables for local distribution. They made that choice because they got a better return and the maintenance costs were lower and all those sorts of things. One social advantage of the cables being underground was shown in South Australia in 1983 during the tragic days of Ash Wednesday. When all the electricity wires were going down and being burnt out, you could actually make phone calls from the middle of a bush fire because all of Telstra's wires were underground. That is a social advantage. Telstra had already done it. Across the bush Telstra's telecommunications cables are already overwhelmingly underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own street in Adelaide the cables are underground down the street, but they go up an electricity pole and my copper pair comes in through the air onto the side of the house. That was done in the 1950s. In some areas of Adelaide you can still see the copper pairs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entwined together, coming in off poles and going into houses. I imagine over the years ahead Telstra will gradually replace those copper pairs with other cabling as they become redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have a major change in telecommunications cabling by Telstra off its own bat. I do not know whether it was way back in the 1950s or the 1960s that the minister responsible for the PMG made an actual decision to tell Telstra or the PMG to put all the country telephone lines underground. I suspect it was done by the management of PMG for economic reasons. I have to say we all would agree that Telstra and these utilities have never been overwhelmingly sensitive to architectural aesthetics in what they have done, but they made that decision. I believe that putting that in there to promote is not out of kilter with what they have already been doing for 30 or 40 years as a telecommunications company. They put the cables underground because it was to their advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention was made of public opinion. Everyone will quote different public opinion polls all over the place and whether this is really an issue that people are upset about. There is a view around that the Liberal Party gets more flak in the leafy treed suburbs of Australia than I might because people in our Labor voting areas are less concerned about it. All I can say as a senator from South Australia is that the outrage is pretty even, although in working class areas the councils have reluctantly had to accept that they cannot stop it happening. I notice in Adelaide that Optus has rolled the cable out first in the working class suburbs and is leaving your leafy Liberal voting electorates until last, because the meetings in those areas have been particularly vigorous. The Mitcham council which is a strong Liberal voting area&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And pretty leafy, as Senator Harradine, a former South Australian, would know. It is very leafy indeed. They have conducted independent public opinion surveys in their area and they have published them. They show 80 per cent of people do not want the cable and, even if it comes, they are now saying, `No matter what it is, we do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1763"> want to connect to it even if it means a slightly cheaper telephone call.' That survey may not have been done by a firm as reputable as Newspoll or AGB McNair, but it was done by a firm that is reputable. It has been operating in South Australia for many years doing those sorts of polls for all sorts of community organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a strong opinion about this and I believe you cannot ignore that public opinion. Minister, you are also the minister for the arts with some commitment to aesthetics, design and so on. I believe you would also have a view that in the long term for Australia it is not just a simple dollar and cents issue about what sort of urban and rural environment we live in. I think it is about setting ourselves examples of how we can have a better urban design and better streetscapes. Even in the working class areas of South Australia they like having bigger trees in the street and better streetscapes. That is not an argument that is only an issue for the silvertails in the leafy suburbs of the North Shore of Sydney; that is an issue everywhere. In new suburbs where all the cables have gone underground&mdash;my state has about 10 per cent of urban areas that have all underground cables&mdash;if you say to them, `We are going to put overhead cables up now,' there would be an absolute riot about it because people understand the advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is not unreasonable, therefore, to put a form of words in. If the present Democrat amendment No. 1 is unacceptable in the form of words&mdash;and I think, technically, it should at least say telecommunications&mdash;Minister, I am willing to say to you that if you want to redraft that, as an objective, I am willing to look at it in a spirit of compromise on this because that is what I want to work my way through this bill on. So if you want to take another adjournment for a period of time during which we can go on to another area, I am willing to support that happening but I will not support Democrat amendments Nos 7 to 12 because they are unnecessary. I again ask you, taking note of all you have said, to have a look at putting something in the objectives that you can live with as well as we can.</PARA>

That is really why we have banned all overhead cabling unless it is done with the consent of local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could say that in principle after 1 July that is clearly an object in relation to future building of pay TV, telephony and broadband services. But this does not talk about that at all; this is going backwards on undergrounding and imposing retrospective burdens.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Telecommunications cables, and doing that wherever possible because that would then signal that it was something worthy of serious examination. In other words, it is desirable in principle but subject to what I think is an absolutely essential examination of the implications. Otherwise, you are simply whistling in the wind. You are saying, `Wouldn't it be nice to have everything underground but we are not prepared to do anything about it?' We say, `It would be nice to do that; let's have a good look at it.' At the end of the day, as you say, Telstra may have been doing these things in the past but they have not been doing it irrespective of cost. They have done it pres 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1764"> umably because it was affordable even though they were a monopolist and did not have to worry about competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a very different world these days. They simply cannot ignore the cost implications and that is why, in some instances, they have sought to compete overhead with Optus because otherwise the practical consequence is that people still have close to the highest local call charges in the world. Government is all about hard choices; it is not about saying, `We have decided in your interests that your cables ought to be underground whether you like it or not and therefore you are going to have 25c local call charges whether you like it or not. The community is entitled to say, `Hang on, why shouldn't we make the hard choice on that?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some councils and suburbs have said they would be perfectly happy to have overhead cables. I told you that Ballarat only last week consummated a deal with Northgate Communications whereby Northgate did not pay anything. The council was very keen to have an overhead service because it provides free local calls to their customers, the prospect of untimed local calls to Melbourne and a whole range of cheaper services such as a 25 per cent discount on pay television and, presumably, broadband services will again be at a significant discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are choices that people make. If people living in one area of Ballarat are perfectly happy to say, `We've got high quality, affordable, high technology services and the price we have had to pay for that is to go overhead; and we accept that outcome,' who are we to say, `No, you are wrong. Sorry; we are not interested. You are going to have it underground. You are going to have to pay more because we think it is in your best interests.' I do not think that is a responsible approach to take. That is why I say I have no problem in principle with that being examined as a desirable objective but it does not follow to me that that will be the inevitable outcome. That will depend upon a whole series of choices and examinations. Therefore, I could accept an amendment that was in the form I have indicated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to think that the government realises that, in looking into it, the mirror&hyphen;mirror approach on this issue is not actually good enough. It does not actually enable the carrier to make that decision if it finds it will cost more. That is why the decisions have been made at the moment for Telstra and other carriers not to continue undergrounding. It is more competitive to do things the cheaper and shoddier way. That is why it is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all you do is change the words to say `if it is cost feasible,' then those in the competitive environment say that they will not do it. If the government comes back with an amendment or a change to the wording, I do not think it is acceptable. It is basically saying, `No, it's not going to happen.' Government knows that. The community, I believe, is making a very strong statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's money, generally, will not go into providing hospitals and schools, and the private contractors, the private carriers, will not put their money into hospitals and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1765"> schools. Their profits will go largely into their pockets. There will be some stuff coming back into government through whatever we have left of Telstra, but the reality is that, largely, this will be taken out of the hands of the community. This is one of the few opportunities the community has to have its say through the Senate process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, it is not acceptable for the government to throw the amendment back. If they throw it back, I hope the response from the community groups that you say do not care or think it is not a big issue will be made very clear to you in the meantime. Such an action of throwing it back with mealy&hyphen;mouthed words that say `We'll do a mirror&hyphen;mirror approach' means that commercially it will not happen. I really do not think that will be good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the basis upon which this is happening, I would like to think there will be a very strong community reaction which will let you know that it is not just the people in the leafy suburbs; it is actually a lot of people who are interested in this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Margetts may have been out of the chamber when we first canvassed the proposed inquiry that the government would conduct. It is not a matter of simply leaving it to the carriers to decide whether it is affordable. It is a matter of deciding from an independent examination, supplemented by high&hyphen;powered, independent research, whether or not that is a path down which the community as a whole ought to go and, if you do decide to do that, who should pay for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, if you say that the carriers ought to pay billions and billions of dollars, it is fairly clear what the consequences of that will be. You will not get any of the price reductions you would otherwise get and you will probably get a lot less investment in the latest technology. If, on the other hand, you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decide that governments ought to bear a substantial portion of that&mdash;be they local, state or even federal government&mdash;again, those are decisions that you would take to impose those obligations on the carriers. So it would not have anything to do with the commercial decision making and discretions of the carriers. It would be a regime imposed by government or by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you ought to at least appreciate that our inquiry is not designed to simply enable the carriers to make their choices. It is designed to examine whether or not the community wants that to occur and, if so, in what proportions the cost should be borne and by whom.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With all due respect, I think the minister has missed the point. The people who are calling for this are saying that it is the carriers' responsibility to act in a responsible way and, yes, if that affects the pricing, that obviously will be reflected in the price of the services. However, that is the reality. But if it is not in the legislation, looking into it in the future means that you will say that people have to pay separately for community interest, public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, that is not good enough, considering all the assurances that were given prior to this push for privatisation: `Oh, yes, we will have those built into legislation'; `Oh, yes, those assurances will be there.

No, the message you are sending is that carriers will have the responsibility for maximising their profit and anything extra in terms of public interest and public amenity will be at the separate expense of taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the chambers of commerce would like that to be the case. I know the chambers of commerce in Western Australia have asked that the universal service obligations should be paid separately. I do not believe that.

The question is whether it is affordable. The only stage we have reached at this point is that government amendments 250 and 251 would require the minister to undertake a review of the options for placing communications and other facilities underground, for example, electricity cabling, with a report to be provided to the parliament by 1 July 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group that we are in the process of putting together has 20 persons, I think, on it. They represent each of the state and territory governments. They represent the Australian Local Government Association, the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, the Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ian Chamber of Commerce, the National Trust, the carriers and ATO. I think that is the full proposed working group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is meant to provide an independent assessment of the options and the costs. As I indicated yesterday, the carriers have already volunteered $1.5 million, which is a very substantial sum of money in the scheme of things. It will enable completely independent research to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Schacht has quite rightly said, if you just took the word of ETSA you would not get anywhere&mdash;which is the last thing we want&mdash;any more than if you took the word of the carriers because they would be speaking through their back pockets. The whole idea is to take that money to commission independent research, to have a proper examination by all of the interested parties and then have the matter reported back to parliament where we can have a full debate on what it all means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that that is the logical progression. It can be against the background that you all would like to see, in principle, cabling underground as quickly as possible. But to simply ignore all of those things and to say up front, `We have decided, irrespective of cost, irrespective of new technology, that everything has to go underground as quickly as possible, but do not tell anyone we are not going to do anything about it, we will just put it in as an objects clause,' is not a sensible and responsible way to proceed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to make some comment about our amendments Nos 1 and 2. The minister has given an undertaking that his review will deal with the two which are specifically asking for a term of reference in that review, and we accept the minister's undertaking on that. He has also indicated that the issues we raise in our amendment No. 1 will be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to explain here that our amendment No. 1 was drafted to acknowledge the fact that this bill itself cannot impose any levy on carriers to provide funds for undergrounding. It was quite rightly pointed out that, under the constitution, any bill that deals with imposing a levy can only be introduced into the House of Representatives. The opposition, of course, has no chance in the House of Representatives of such a bill being introduced because of the numbers down there, so nothing will happen. We accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it was pointed out to me by my advisers that we could allow a situation to occur whereby, if local government and carriers reached agreement themselves on some levy to start the undergrounding process in a council area under the existing state planning legislation, this would be allowable. This is what my amendment No. 1 does, but it also makes it clear that any such levy agreed to between a council and a carrier cannot be imposed without the approval of the Australian Communications Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we put that there is that, firstly, it is our constitutional power under telecommunications to have that with the ACA and, secondly, although the ACA will not be determining the levy, by having to have its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approval means that certain criteria can be looked at. One of the issues a number of people have raised, including the minister, is that, if a carrier reaches agreement to accept a levy on its operation to pay for undergrounding in a particular council area, it cannot cross&hyphen;subsidise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, you might find that in one council area it is agreed that the carrier will put up charges to all consumers of telephony across the whole of the network of Sydney to help pay for the undergrounding in North Sydney. Therefore, consumers in an area where there is no program to underground in effect would be paying a higher price to subsidise a specific area. In my view, that would be very clearly an area the ACA should rule out&mdash;that levies cannot be cross&hyphen;subsidised by the area where there is no undergrounding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my discussions with the Local Government Association of Australia in the last few days it is clear that they accept and understand this issue. They would like to get a general levy applied&mdash;and I think the minister's review will find this&mdash;across whole regions of the metropolitan area so there is no missing out and there is no possibility of a cross&hyphen;subsidy. That is an issue that the minister's review is going to have to deal with. Certainly, the opposition does not support an accidental cross&hyphen;subsidy or a designed cross&hyphen;subsidy that all consumers would pay for but with only some areas to go underground. It should be directly relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to put on the record that the opposition does not support cross&hyphen;subsidy. That is why in the long run we hope the minister's review deals with an issue of having a broad based levy over a long period of time&mdash;accepting the minister's view expressed today that there is no way that you can underground overhead cables in a short term. It is a going to be a 10&hyphen; or 15&hyphen;year period. And that is when you determine a levy to raise the money over a lengthy period of time for a dedicated fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue that we are concerned about is that we want to make sure that any levy that is raised goes to that specific purpose of undergrounding. We are strongly opposed to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1773"> any levy being placed on overhead cables to raise revenue for councils to do something else. I think the consumers would be outraged if they found that the money went to building a new town hall or to some other non&hyphen;undergrounding process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had issues raised that New South Wales and South Australia local government law, once this immunity is adjusted, would allow councils, unless this act stops it, to raise levies of their own volition in those two states. I have been lobbied very hard by local government associations, particularly from my own state and from New South Wales, to allow that to continue. I have indicated that the opposition's view is that if there is going to be a levy it should be for a dedicated purpose, properly administered under the control of the independent authority, the ACA, to ensure that it all goes in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, with the undertaking that you have given that my amendments 1 and 2 or all of them on 417&mdash;four of them are procedural&mdash;will be included in the terms of reference for your working party and so on, I will accept that as a compromise with the government. I point out to Senator Patterson that, again, this is cooperation from the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats would support the opposition's amendment. We think that local government should be allowed to impose levies on carriers in respect of their infrastructure. It is the case that in places such as New South Wales this is already happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be our preference for enabling this to occur, as can be seen from item 91 of the Australian Democrats' amendments, to delete clause 42 of schedule 3 all together. This is the position of the New South Wales Local Government Association and of many other community organisations such as the Cables Downunder group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this clause is to annul state or territory laws which discriminate or which would have the effect, even if it is indirect, of discriminating against a particular carrier, against a particular class of carriers or against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> carriers generally. In our view, that clause is not necessary, and we would even go so far as to say it is devious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passage of this clause as it currently stands would severely limit if not entirely eradicate the ability of councils to protect their long&hyphen;term investments in expensive infrastructure. This is a particularly serious problem in New South Wales and South Australia where such schemes currently exist. In these states, for example, local government authorities are not permitted under state law to impose rates on electricity utilities and, given that situation, they would not be able to impose rates on telecommunications carriers because doing so would discriminate between carriers and the power utilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the New South Wales Local Government Association has argued that passage of this clause would at best act as a trigger to enormous litigation about the proper application of state and territory laws and, at worst, cause local communities to subsidise the profits of telecommunications carriers&mdash;and we think these are important points. Local authorities may well be driven to challenge the validity of a Commonwealth law which overrides their rights, in addition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more important point however is that where private interests gain from the use of public assets or where they devalue those public assets such as the urban environment then they should pay a reasonable charge for such use or devaluation. If charges are not levied on private interests who profit from or devalue public assets, then the broader community is in effect subsidising the activities of the corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that rather than preventing such charging from occurring government ought to be encouraging it. No doubt the carriers do not want to face extra costs and charges, but they should be forced to compensate the community for the urban blight that they have caused in so many places. There is nothing inappropriate about such charging. It is perfectly in line with the whole notion of user pays&mdash;or should we say polluter pays&mdash;and the government should, for once, side with the community interests rather than those of the big end of town.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1774">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP amendments are an alternative approach to those proposed by the Democrats. It is important to note however that the ALP amendments only make an exception to this anti&hyphen;discrimination clause for the sole purpose of enabling a levy to be raised from overhead cabling. It does not permit a levy to be charged for other forms of telecommunications infrastructure which are despoiling public assets in some way. Conventional economic analysis would suggest that such charging is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of achieving a positive outcome the Democrats are considering supporting the opposition amendments, but before doing so there are a few points that I would like to raise, and questions I would like to put to Senator Schacht. Could you confirm, Senator, whether your amendment enables those states, such as New South Wales, where a levy is currently applicable to continue to apply the levy? My reading of subclause 1 of your amendment suggests that this is possible. Perhaps the minister might also like to comment on that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not proceeding with those amendments on sheet 417 for the reasons I have given. The government has now given an undertaking which I accept as a strong undertaking. I also do so knowing that the minister will have to present a report back here. I have to tell the minister that that will be a report that the opposition does not expect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will drop into a pigeon hole and disappear out of sight. If you expect that to be the view, whatever the opposition's argument about that is, you are going to find in the local community that this issue is not going to go away. It just will not go away despite any attempt by a Labor or coalition government in the future to ignore the overhead cables issue and say, `We are not going to deal with it; we have had reports, it's all very nice.' The opposition accepts that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not expect it to be a unanimous report because of the interests, as I said before, on the committee. There may be a majority report. I would hope that the government will then make some recommendations. I would certainly expect that during 1998&hyphen;99 we would come back into this place to debate appropriate legislative amendments to deal with the issue of overhead cabling. If the government did not proceed with that or if the opposition backed away from it then I would think that we would have to take our punishment in the general community because the community does expect action on it. I am as impatient as the Democrats or the Greens about getting an outcome on this. I do not think you can walk away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has mentioned ETSA in my own state. For 10 years I have led almost a one&hyphen;person campaign in South Australia to get ETSA to go underground with its overhead electricity cables, and along comes telecommunications. So I have been on the record in my own state as being a consistent advocate of undergrounding of all cables. The immunity issue about planning and management being amended, which we will be debating generally, is an issue that I hope the planning review will also have to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue that I would expect is going to have to be dealt with. In my own state an independent accident research unit at Adelaide University has informally suggested to me that up to 20 people a year may be killed unnecessarily because they hit a stobie pole, as we call them in Adelaide. The poles are non&hyphen;frangible&mdash;they do not bend. They are designed to do the maximum damage not only to the car but also to the people in it, who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1775"> may, through no fault of their own, hit the pole.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pole jumps out into the middle of the road, does it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is on the edge of the road. You could be driving along and someone could hit you into the pole. This is what they have found. For 40 or 50 years this has been going on. ETSA has never had to worry about it because they have had the shield of the crown as a statutory state authority. Sooner or later the community is going to ask about even statutory authorities; and if they are privatised and are no longer owned by the public, should they still get the same immunity?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that we have telecommunications cables hanging on those poles in Adelaide does that mean that a telecommunications carrier, if the shield of the crown is removed or adjusted or if they are privatised, is in any way responsible for a class or individual action being taken for damages if someone is killed or injured by hitting a stobie pole? It is not like hitting a ramp or even a tree; they have sharp edges and they just cut a car to pieces. If you said, in any other area of public health, that up to 20 people a year were dying there would be considerable outrage and action demanded to change it. Those are issues that, in the end, the review panel is going to have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison asked me about whether my amendment allows the continuation of the situation in New South Wales and South Australia. As I understand it, and I stand to be corrected by the minister, the ability of local governments in those two states to continue to put their own levy on is prohibited elsewhere in the bill. I have been lobbied very hard, as I said before, to support the continuation of the situation in those two states if the local governments have been given the power by the state government to put a levy on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think that is a patchwork approach. I think all local governments should be able to be involved in establishing a national levy. I have to accept that I cannot do that through this bill. I have had to compromise and go through the minister's review arrangement because there is no way I can do it. I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think it is fair that two states can do it automatically through a state planning arrangement when other states cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always argued on telecommunications that, in the end, this parliament takes responsibility for the provision of a national telecommunications system to all Australian citizens, and that includes the planning arrangements. Therefore, I say to Senator Allison that, as I understand it, this bill will prohibit local government councils in New South Wales and South Australia from putting their own levy on&mdash;for whatever purpose. I think that in another 12 months we will have to debate a different form of the levy on a national basis that all councils can participate in.</PARA></SPEECH>

As I have also said, this is because the proposed legislation does not ensure that all cabling is installed underground in the first place, so cables less than 13 millimetres in diameter will continue to be exempt. But no doubt we will have this debate further on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there is nothing about implementation of an undergrounding program in the legislation. The minister has no requirements beyond 1 July 1998, which is when he is to have the report completed. That was the reason the Democrats moved amendments earlier. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These opposition amendments are designed to ensure that directory assistance is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis. In recent times Telstra has floated, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> though not formally put to the government, a change that would see directory assistance being charged at the rate of 50c per call. Telstra puts an argument that it costs about $200 million per annum to provide directory assistance across Australia&mdash;that is, when anyone rings on a normal telephone to find out what a telephone number is, the millions of calls to that service each year cost Telstra about $200 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this service should remain free. I find it a bit hard that Telstra argues that this is a crippling or a substantial cost when it has revenues of $15 billion and when its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which is not directly related, of course, to directory assistance but it does provide directory assistance for business&mdash;is a very profitable business indeed. I think it earns some hundreds of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra is going to try to cost recover on every community service where the community has accepted and welcomed the provision of that service, I think it will do itself a lot of damage&mdash;and it will do considerable damage in the community. When Telstra officials came to lobby me to support this change to charge a 50c fee for directory assistance, they said that this was economically most efficient for them. I said that it might be, in a very narrow accountancy arrangement, that this is very efficient for them but, in the broader context of their relations with the community, I believed it to be a very short&hyphen;sighted view. I said, `If you want to end up looking like the banks in Australia where every service that is provided is charged for&mdash;where pensioners get charged a fee for a deposit&mdash;you will end up as unpopular as the banks, and your name will be muddied and dirtied because people will believe you are only operating on a narrow accountancy provision, with every service being cost recovered.' I said that I would have thought that $200 million worth of goodwill would be a major marketing advantage for Telstra. They would be able to say, `Yes, we run as a commercial operation but there are certain services we provide free, or below cost, because they are services to the community', and the community would respond to that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1779">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great marketing advantages Telstra has is that a majority of Australians still see Telstra as their telecommunications company. Even though in the past there have been complaints about some levels of Telstra services&mdash;and there will always be complaints when you are dealing with services to 10 million consumers&mdash;in the last few years Australians have seen a marked improvement in customer services and have responded accordingly. That is why, in public opinion polls, Australians have not been in favour of the partial privatisation of Telstra: they see it as a company that has delivered to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that if Telstra takes to the nth degree the cost recovery process, it may recover the $200 million it costs it for directory assistance but, in marketing terms, in a competitive environment, it may lose hundreds of millions of dollars elsewhere. I think it has to get the balance right. If it wants to maintain its pre&hyphen;eminent position of dominant telecommunications carrier in Australia, it ought to make sure it does not end up with the same reputation in this country as the banks, which, in the last 10 years, have gone berserk and reduced services and charged ordinary Australians so as to make it uneconomic for ordinary Australians to have small bank accounts. If Telstra wants to go the same way, it will do itself a lot of damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the opposition has moved this group of amendments to ensure that directory assistance is maintained for all Australians as a free service. We believe, unfortunately, that, if Telstra is going to take the other line, then we as an opposition are forced to move these amendments. We do so, and commend them to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could intervene here immediately. There is no such thing, I suppose, as a free service&mdash;somebody has to pay for it and it will be other consumers. In effect, one needs to look at those customers at the present moment who are using the service and perhaps overusing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, under the current act, a telco is required to notify the government if it wants to charge for directory assistance, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government can refuse it that request. What I would like to hear from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) is some indication of the guidelines to be used by the government in respect of any request by any telco for a charge for directory assistance. For example, how are people with disabilities going to be dealt with? And what is going to happen to people who are getting a bit long in the tooth and cannot use the phone books because of the fine print? Will they have to pay? What guidelines will the government have in respect of these particular matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the government would not agree to any charge for directory assistance calls for customers who do not have that particular telephone book&mdash;for example, if the number is out of their region. That would be inexcusable. And surely every customer would need to have access to some number of directory assistance calls in a particular period before any charge is made. I would certainly like the minister&mdash;if he can now or, if not, at some stage during this discussion&mdash;to provide the committee with the guidelines that might be used by the government when assessing such a request by a telco.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition's amendments are similar to the Democrats' amendments&mdash;except for opposition amendment No. 6, which is in conflict with our amendment No. 13. Mr Chairman, what is the process in this respect? Can we debate these amendments cognately in order to explore the difference here?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats' amendment No. 13 seeks to have operator assisted directory services and other services as prescribed incorporated into the universal service obligation. In doing so, we would ensure that such services are reasonably accessible and provided free of charge to all persons irrespective of where they reside or where they carry on their business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, if Telstra wishes to impose a fee for directory assistance before 31 December 1998, it is required to notify the minister of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1780"> that proposal and obtain his or her approval. Under section 24 of the Telstra act, a carrier that proposes to alter a charge which is subject to notification and disqualification must inform the minister at least 30 days before it is to take effect. The minister must then request Austel to provide a report as to whether the alteration should be disallowed in the public interest and to direct the carrier not to make the alteration until the minister has received and considered the report. On receiving the report, the minister has 30 days to decide whether to disallow the alteration on the basis that it is not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given it is government policy that directory services be provided free of charge, Telstra would appear to have very little hope of introducing charges. However, as has been noted, these arrangements will come to a close on 31 December 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to suggest that, if the government wants to give lasting effect to its policy of ensuring customers are provided operated assisted directory services and if it wants to ensure that the cost of providing the services is shared equitably amongst the carriers, it should legislate to incorporate this into the USO. Consumers should not be deluded into thinking that operator assisted directory services and other services will continue free of charge once the current arrangements come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all heard Telstra state repeatedly that it does want to introduce charges for such services. Their most recent proposal in February this year suggested a charge of 50c per call. That would have reaped Telstra an estimated $150 million in additional profit each year, whilst customers making just one directory assistance call per month under that arrangement would have been worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of concerns with the opposition's proposal. Perhaps we could discuss those and reach some sort of compromise&mdash;ideally, a compromise that would also be acceptable to the government. Given they are also committed to the ongoing provision of free of charge directory services, this should be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my concerns with the opposition amendments is that they do not actually 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> require operator assisted directory services be free of charge&mdash;rather they simply say `directory services'. I wondered whether this was an oversight or whether ensuring the provision of phone books would satisfy that requirement. Perhaps I can ask Senator Schacht to respond, if he is able to, and tell me whether it is operator or phone book assistance we are talking about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I can be of some assistance. Let us look at the wording of our amendment. The term `directory assistance services' I think clearly identifies that we are talking about operator assistance, not just specifically directory services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Putting in a definition of operator or trying to define the word `operator' is a problem because there is a whole range of services that may be beyond directory assistance where you have an operator service, such as accounts or providing information about other services within Telstra. I think they are commercial services that should not automatically be put into the universal service obligation on the common understanding of what ordinary Australians think directory assistance is, which is to ring up and say, `Can you tell me the telephone number for Mrs Smith of Black Street, Blacktown?' That is a simple query on what the number is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS> . That is basically the common understanding of the community about directory assistance that has been provided free of charge ever since the first telephone was provided, I understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that that service should be the one guaranteed to be in the USO. I am a bit concerned that if you put it the way you describe operator, there are a range of other operators that people will say ought to be in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1781"> when it is a commercial service. That is why I have tried to guarantee that the service as people commonly understand it is provided whereas the proliferation of other services do not accidentally get caught up in the definition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand corrected if that is the case. But we have been discussing directory assistance services for some time now and that word `operator' has usually been part of that phrase. It is not something we want to die in a ditch over but it did seem to me to be consistent with the approach in the past and is not meant to suggest that that is more than the directory services that you are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another concern that we have; that users of mobile phones are excluded from access to free of charge directory assistance. Currently mobile phones can ring the basic 013 service. They just get the number, they do not get the automatic transfer onto a line. If they want that kind of value adding service they could ring 0130, as I understand it, and they pay a fee for that. But I do not see any reason why mobile phone users should be excluded from that basic service provision. In many ways they contribute an enormous amount to the revenue coming in on telephone services and they are more likely than anybody else not to be carrying a directory in their back pockets as they move around.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1781" TIME="11.41 a.m." SPEAKER="Schacht, Sen Chris" NAMEID="4J4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.41 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a point well raised by Senator Allison. The reason we have excluded mobile phones is that this is to go into the universal service obligation to be determined on the cross&hyphen;subsidy arrangement. Again, it is a balance between what it is reasonable to put into the universal service obligation and what people have commonly expected to be available to them as normal directory assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a decision taken in 1987 that has probably had one of the most profound implications for telecommunications but no&hyphen;one at the time argued about it because no&hyphen;one believed that we would end up with millions of subscribers for mobile telephones. In 1987 Telstra, in introducing the mobile phone service, said it would be a timed call. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There was no discussion or debate, as I am aware&mdash;I was not in the parliament at the time. It was just accepted that mobile telephones would be on a timed rate, even if it was on a local call. I suspect that at the time all of us thought that mobile phones were a bit esoteric and were for those people at the Stock Exchange, or a very limited number of professional and business people who would be the only ones able to afford it. The cost in 1987 ran into a couple of thousand dollars to get access and buy a mobile telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that after all the many arguments we have had in this place about charging rates, one of the most significant decisions ever taken was that mobile telephone calls in a local call area would be at a timed rate. I also think that, as a result, people have accepted that. They might not like it but it is now operating and no&hyphen;one is proposing to change that. I also think that, in the common purpose of directory assistance, if you were going to put mobile phones in the universal service obligation a lot of people would say that the universal service obligation is about ensuring that people in the community who could be disadvantaged get access to a telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment means providing traditional directory assistance to homes for domestic consumers, and in many cases it is pensioners or people with some disability who are using it. The mobile telephone system is used by people who by and large, by definition, are not overwhelmingly discriminated against or denied access to a decent telecommunications system. The system is working well for them. We believe, as far as the universal service obligation is concerned, it should not be in the calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out that that still does not stop Telstra from providing directory assistance to the mobile phone system free of charge. If they were smart in the marketplace, and considering the competition they have, I think they should continue to provide the service accordingly. But we do not believe it ought to be in the universal service obligation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is a distinction. There is an important point to be made about what sort of telecommunications system you want in this country and whether it should be cost based or not. There might be some who think that the whole service ought to be free, but we do not take that view. We think the proper incentive structures will only arise if you do have sensible charging structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what Senator Harradine asked, I think there are some very important issues to be addressed here, because the position we have at the present time is that there are something like 400 million calls to 013 each year. That is over a million calls a day, and it is growing at the rate of about 20 per cent to 25 per cent a year. It cost Telstra last year, I think, under $200 million. They estimate that in the next financial year it will cost in excess of $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 70 per cent of those callers are people who do have access to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS>. Those who have mobile phones, whilst they might not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS> sitting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alongside them in the front seat of the car, I would have thought would expect to be charged and can afford to be charged. Therefore, you would have to say that the great bulk of people using 013 services do not need to or, if they do, they would be prepared to be charged for the privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very important concerns, therefore, that can strike the right balance that Senator Schacht talked about. I do not think that the carriers should be encouraged or permitted to put themselves in a position where they are regarded as social pariahs. I would have thought that, in a highly competitive environment, that is the last reputation you would want. Indeed, if your competitor was building up that sort of reputation, you would be going very fast in the opposite direction and portraying yourself as very user friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case in many countries that calls to directory assistance are charged. It has never been the case in Australia, essentially for political reasons. The way the regime operates at the moment under the Telstra Corporation Act is that Telstra is entitled to apply to the minister and the minister is then entitled to approve or reject or refer it off to Austel for consideration. So there are stages in the process that would allow the matters to be debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not any formal proposition on the table, but I think we are all aware that Telstra were seriously interested in advancing a proposition several months back. From my point of view, it was not one that I thought was acceptable, but it had the makings of an acceptable outcome. In other words, I think you have to ensure that you absolutely and positively protect those who need access to the service and who essentially cannot afford to pay it or those who do not have access to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS>. If you are print handicapped, quite clearly, you cannot use the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS> and you should not be penalised as a result of making an 013 call. Similarly, the national relay service, which provides the teletype facility, is designed to assist the hearing impaired and, again, that is a free service funded on budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1783">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you can go beyond that. It seemed to me that 50c a call was pretty much on the high side. I did not really understand why you needed to go beyond 25c, for example, if that is the standard local call charge. Similarly, as I understood it, Telstra was proceeding down the path of recognising that this should not be simply an opportunity to make money on the deal&mdash;even though it is costing them $200 million or $300 million&mdash;and that they should be prepared to look at that money going back into the system either by way of a discount on access charges, handset rentals and the like or by other means. So I think it is possible to devise a system in which you can protect the people who need to be protected and, at the same time, impose a charge that will get the growth rate under control. It does need to be carefully monitored to ensure that it is within reasonable bounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It simply does not make sense in this day and age to require a carrier to go on incurring a cost burden quite needlessly. The majority of the population, I would have thought, would not have sensible quarrels with that proposition. If you did a survey, everyone might say they would like to have free local calls, but I do not think that that is proper guide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did see a survey recently that suggested that something like a third of the community already thought that the directory assistance calls were charged. So in that sense I would be surprised if the proportion was not a lot higher for mobile phone users. I would have thought the majority of them would take it for granted that they were paying timed rates both for ordinary calls and for directory assistance calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think it is possible to devise a regime. I think we would need to tread very carefully before we went down that track, but I certainly think that it is a very retrograde step to effectively insert a provision because somehow it might pick up a few popular votes in the short term. It will have fundamentally uncompetitive consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will simply mean, as Senator Harradine says, that the money has to come from somewhere and that will then be built in, or added to, all of the other charges. If you ask why we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the highest local call charges in the world, or close to it, there is a combination of reasons. The more you impose those sorts of burdens, the more likely it is that you will reduce their capacity to offer world best practice on local call charges and, indeed, a range of other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the position the government takes on this is that it would not be in the best interests of consumers to simply turn a blind eye to an ever-escalating bill which is borne by carriers when the reality is that something like 70 per cent of the population simply choose the service out of convenience. I saw a statistic which said that about 22 per cent of users are aged 18 to 24. I own a couple of those, and they would be classic examples. They would not be bothered looking up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS>. They would be more than happy to borrow my mobile phone and I am quite sure they would not have any compunction about dialling 013 whenever they wanted a number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighteen to 24-year-olds use the service 22 times per month compared with the average of six times per month. Fourteen per cent of the population account for 52 per cent of 013 calls. Some businesses repeatedly use the service 500 times per day to gain commercial information cheaply. As you know, that is why Telstra have made it progressively harder to access it. They have limited it to two numbers per call. I suppose that if you are ringing from a business you would not mind&mdash;you just keep ringing again, put it on redial and keep going. Telstra have also applied queuing theory, so they do not put on the number of operators to accommodate all of those calls within a 10-second time frame for answer, which I understand is the standard practice in the US, although it might vary a bit state by state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very inefficient system. All you are going to do is force the carriers to be more and more dilatory in responding because they do not want to encourage people to use services which users could afford to pay for and for which the carriers are not able to recoup any of those costs. We already have a variety of operator assisted calls that are charged, whether they are wake-up and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1784"> reminder calls, Australia direct or reverse charge calls. It is simply a question of striking the right balance to ensure that on the one hand you have cost based pricing which puts the right incentives in place and on the other hand you have all the necessary social protections in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could devise a statement of principles against which we would measure any formal application. I would be prepared to do some work on that. I share Senator Harradine's concerns very much. I do not think in any shape or form it would make sense for people who are handicapped or disadvantaged in various ways to be forced to pay a charge which they currently do not pay. But that is not the great bulk of the population. They certainly are not a significant proportion of the people who racked up $305 million in 1988-89.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I am not reassured by the remarks of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). Free directory services are always going to be a target, and we will have this debate over and over again as the industry and Telstra at this stage wish to charge for the calls. Remarks such as, `We are just going for the popular votes,' `It is all short term,' and `The cost burden is being imposed quite needlessly,' are interesting in the light of the very recent remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that this service is intended to be a free one in the foreseeable future. With those remarks, I would indicate that we support the opposition's amendments and that we will not proceed with ours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, the reason we are in the position of moving these amendments is that parliament will not have a say on this issue. You may say it is crude populism, but when that Telstra document went out, or was leaked, I did a number of radio talkback programs&mdash;I do not say that they are an average survey of these sorts of things&mdash;and it was pretty remarkable that the comments from the phone calls were overwhelmingly adverse. Again, that is not a scientific measure for this. The problem that we have is that if our amendment is defeated or we withdraw it, then the parliament, on this issue of where you go on directory assistance,

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the early years they came forward with a proposal which, as I recall, was very ill thought out, was simply across the board, and you quite rightly knocked it back. We are all aware that this is a very sensitive issue. It is not quite at the `timed local calls' level of debate. I heard some of those radio talkback programs and I have to say, as often happens in these things&mdash;I am sure you were not whipping it up&mdash;that people respond to the general proposition. They use whatever arguments they can, irrespective of the facts. So they will say, `That's outrageous. I've got a 99&hyphen;year&hyphen;old grandmother at home. Why should she have to pay for it? She has been deaf and blind for 20 years.' They are outraged. Then the next person rings up and says, `I couldn't agree more with the last speaker,' and away it all goes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In part, that is why governments are very sensitive in acceding to those sorts of requests because the politics can very much overtake reality. That is why I think you have to bend over backwards to get it right. Just as we made it plain to Telstra that they had a lot more work to do, they have been reluctant to come forward in recent years because they understand the level of community concern. It would be upon our heads, or any government's head, to simply give the green light to a proposal that had not been very carefully worked through. The option to refer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it to Austel is a very useful safeguard in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inevitably, the matter would be out in the public arena, there would be all sorts of opportunities for the parliament to be expressing its view in spades. As I say, it may well make sense to pick up on Senator Harradine's suggestion and look at a statement of principles against which that could be measured before it comes forward, rather than saying, `Give us your idea and we will kick it around.' Having said that, I would still take the view that you should leave the option on the table where it lies and not simply succumb to the temptation to basically play the populist card, irrespective of cost, because inevitably it is going to be passed on to other consumers.</PARA></SPEECH>

The inclusion of the National Relay Service as part of the USO was made by the standard telephone service review group. It was recommendation No. 8 of their report. Given that both the coalition and ALP in addition to the Democrats have previously expressed support for this report in their respective reports to the Senate telecommunications bills inquiry, I cannot see any reason for objecting to this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just sort of reeling from the shock of Senator Margetts labouring under the illusion that the committee has just decided to impose charges for directory assistance. What we did was to maintain the status quo, which allows Telstra to bring forward a proposal&mdash;and we have had a detailed discussion about the basis on which we might conceivably consider that at some time in the future&mdash;but there is no proposal at the moment, certainly no requirement, for charging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you do refer to, however, is simply another example of the sort of rearguard action that the carrier is forced to undertake to discourage people from using the service. As I recall, something like four per cent of calls to 013 are not actually seeking telephone numbers. I think some of them even ring up asking for the latest state of the weather and, because Telstra is not allowed to charge, it is saying, `This isn't just a general help line. This is to provide telephone numbers. If you want addresses, you look them up in the phone book.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of what we have done today has anything to do with that except that it is an example of the sorts of responses you get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from a carrier that will be incurring losses in the order of $200 million and up to $300 million in the next couple of years.

I think I can recall some years ago ringing up asking for an address and being told that that was not the purpose of the service. I think they then did start to provide it and only recently they decided, again, that it was not the core purpose and, because they are free calls, they are taking what opportunities are available to them to restrict that growth, which is in the order of 20 per cent to 25 per cent a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position in relation to the National Relay Service for the hearing impaired is that we are very supportive of the whole concept. This is simply an argument about how it can best be funded. Let there be no misunderstanding, I do not think anyone in the chamber is proposing to wind back current arrangements. At the moment it is funded from the budget. It is possible to do it on a stand&hyphen;alone industry basis, or you could fold it into the USO. That is not, I have to say, what the USO is designed to do. The USO is designed to cross-subsidise people in uneconomic regional areas, so it was a geographic concept rather than a social assistance concept. However, there is no reason why these things cannot evolve over time and why you cannot have a broad scheme that incorporates a range of different objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is that we are proposing to review the method of funding for the National Relay Service. That examination will proceed

At the Senate legislative committee hearings when the people representing the various deaf organisations and people who are handicapped came and gave their evidence, they used their interpreters with sign language and so on and explained the impact that telecommunications can have in the operation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, as Senator Allison has pointed out, we are supporting this amendment. In the review of the standard telephone service, recommendation 8 on page 140&mdash;it is called prescribed goods and service, National Relay Service&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A service to facilitate interpersonal communications by people with hearing and/or speech impairments similar in purpose and overall cost to the National Relay Service should be incorporated into the universal service arrangements through the making of a regulation establishing it as a service for use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in connection with a standard telephone service. These arrangements should commence on the expiry of the existing Commonwealth funding arrangements at the end of 1997 and 1998.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, the review of the standard telephone service has done the work that you suggested in your previous remarks ought to be done before you make a commitment. This review has done the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of the evidence we were given at the Senate hearing earlier this year, I would think it would be to the government's real advantage to put this into the USO. There is one thing: the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would be very pleased because it would get it off the budget. You are actually going back to tell Mr Costello that you have saved him whatever the amount of money is because this is going to be in the USO and the carriers are going to pay for it. I would have thought that would have been extremely attractive to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) in any budget lead&hyphen;up. With this review, it really should not be a problem for the government to vote for this amendment, and we will certainly be supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

I can understand the concept. I have a considerable degree of sympathy for wanting to protect it in legislation rather than simply having it on budget. I think what we had in mind was that we would be looking at the best way of doing it and perhaps even upgrading it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I note that the Democrats have moved amendment No. 46, which the running sheet says is in conflict with government amendments Nos. 82 and 177. I checked Democrat amendment 46&mdash;and Senator Allison may wish to speak to it&mdash;and it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . omit "an emergency service number", substitute "a single national emergency service number".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the hearings we had evidence from a number of organisations, such as police associations and organisations, and almost a unanimous view on behalf of the ministerial committee meeting of police ministers and justice ministers, et cetera, arguing for a national emergency number. I know there have been some strong statements made on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1792"> this issue. In commonsense terms, we could have one national emergency telephone number across Australia, so that when you ring 999 or whatever it is, you get through to that emergency number. Such a number could be easily remembered, publicised and promoted in schools, et cetera, so that people know about it and can remember it. It could become even better known than the 013 number just because it is so frequently publicised, as those state organisations, such as the police and emergency services, said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wonder whether the Democrat amendment on this is acceptable to you and whether you have gone that far. I know there are some practical issues but there was some compelling evidence that if it is technically possible we ought to have one national emergency telephone number in Australia. I think the carriers ought to deal with whatever problems they may have. That seemed to me a compelling case at the hearings. Senator Allison may wish to say something as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you , Senator Schacht, for speaking to our amendment. We do think it is desirable that there be a single national emergency number where it is technically feasible. As Senator Schacht has indicated, we heard very loud and strong arguments for that need to have the single national emergency number from the consumer groups as well as emergency service providers. This is unfortunately in contrast with the proposed legislation, which allows for the possibility of multiple emergency numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is necessary to repeat all the concerns that we have heard. I think we all understand those. But we do want to make the observation that the very fact that the government came up with this proposal reveals, I guess, the ludicrous extent to which they are prepared to drive competition policy. It is supposed to ultimately benefit consumers but I think that commitment to that principle has shown that it is not in the interests of Australians in this respect. So, yes, like Senator Schacht I would be grateful for an indication from the government as to whether this is the direction in which the government will be prepared to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the principle underlying the recommendation but it seems to us that it is impractical to achieve it at this time. There are currently three numbers in use: 000, which is provided nationally; the 1800 number for TTY users; and 112, which is required for us to comply with international agreements for the GSM digital mobile telephone service. The Democrats understand this because the proposed amendments on sheet 407 and on sheet 427 allow other emergency service numbers to exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no point in requiring the ACA to have regard to an objective for the making of emergency call services that cannot be achieved. Even where a single number is achieved, it may not be desirable to mandate that this remains the case. Technologies and services may change, necessitating a change of numbers or other numbers for some uses. International technology agreements may require other emergency numbers to be available&mdash;for example, for the use of mobile telephone customers who make use of international roaming agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, government amendment 82 requires the ACA in making a determination in relation to emergency services to have regard to the objective that there should be the appearance of a single national emergency call system and that community expectations in relation to the provision of emergency call services are met. This is intended to ensure a minimum confusion on the part of end users of the standard telephone service in relation to emergency call services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government considers that it is going as far and as fast down this path as is sensible and that we should not lock ourselves into inflexible arrangements which may indeed conflict not only with technological progress but international agreements.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Greens' amendments Nos 1 to 3 on sheet 403 relate to what I spoke about in my second reading contribution, and that is that currently the boundary of a telecommunications network is the switch inside the house. There will be changes as a result of this legislation which will mean that the boundary will be the place where the line meets the outside of the house. The issue of network boundaries is one in which this new proposed act is inferior to the existing act. The existing act specifies that the network boundary for most consumers is their wall socket. Under this bill, that would be changed and the network boundary would now be set by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If no regulations are introduced, the legislation states that, in the case of a telecommunications network that is used to supply carriage service to an end user in a building by means of a line that enters the building, the building entry point is the network boundary. This change is one that impacts on the most vulnerable users of telecommunications services. For example, older persons living in a unit on the top floor of a building would then have the network boundary&mdash;that is, the point at which the carrier is responsible&mdash;far away from the point at which they access the network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event of a difficulty that arose within the building, it is not clear how they would go about having it repaired. For example, how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would they actually know if the problem with their phone was a problem that existed outside the building or within the building? If the network boundary extended to the wall socket then there would be no such confusion. Who do the people contact if the problem is within the building&mdash;the building owner? None of this is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certainly safety issues involved here. I imagine there are access and equity issues too, because if you do not happen to have a good landperson, then you are going to be disadvantaged under the system and there will be a lot of confusion in the interim. Our amendments simply give consumers the certainty that they have under the existing act, while not interfering with other non-residential consumers' ability to negotiate their own arrangements.

Since the Greens' amendments are more streamlined than our own, I will be happy to support those in place of ours. I will just make some remarks about these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these amendments is to see that the network boundary continues until the first telephone socket rather than at the building entry point, as is proposed by the legislation. The Democrats do not believe that the potential benefits of having the network boundary terminate at the building entry point outweigh the negative impacts. While it will reduce the costs to the carriers who will no longer have to install wiring to that first socket, it will mean added expense and inconvenience for the great majority of residential customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The outcome of the government's proposed change of definition would transfer greater responsibility for the costs of connection for fault detection and service restoration to the customer. While the Democrats can understand the desire of carriers to avoid the costs of providing cabling to the socket, we are also conscious of the needs of consumers. We think it is highly inappropriate to dress up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1795"> what is very clearly a cost cutting measure for carriers as a benefit to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, there is no indication that consumers are to receive any compensatory reduction in their installation cost or their line rental charges, which would have reflected the cost that carriers are no longer liable for wiring between the entry point and the first socket.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days a degree of publicity has been given to the travel expenditure run up by ATSIC commissioners in the last couple of years. Given the expenditure of public moneys on ATSIC, it is appropriate that these expenditures be submitted to public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approximately 12 months ago, I was alerted to the apparent excessive expenditure by some ATSIC commissioners. Rather than make the simple allegations, I sought to obtain the relevant data. Through the appropriate forum of the Senate, I sought the details. It would be fair to say that the details were somewhat slow in coming. After literally months of waiting, I did receive a 22&hyphen;page response and it appears as though some of the figures may be wrong. I look forward to receiving an update as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information that I received apparently justifies the concerns that were expressed to me about the travel allowances being paid. However, as I said in releasing the figures, it is too early to draw any conclusions or make any adverse inferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that I welcome the referral of this matter to the director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. The question of the travel allowance paid to ATSIC commissioners has been referred to the director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to ensure that there has been full accountability. It was referred by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after consultation with the new chair of ATSIC. I understand that referral was made on 4 March 1997, the very day before I received the official information. So, as soon as ATSIC and the minister's office were alerted to these figures, they took what could only be described as the proper course of action. Both the minister and the chairman of ATSIC are concerned to ensure that the claims are consistent with the three roles of commissioners&mdash;namely, their duties and responsibilities to attend board meetings, portfolio responsibilities, and zone responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that they were concerned given that, in one case, travel allowance was claimed by one commissioner to the sum of $68,000 for one year. It is important to note at this stage that the new board of ATSIC passed a resolution at its first meeting in December that says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commissioners be responsible for managing their own administrative allocations and that extra funds will not be available if Commissioners over&hyphen;expend.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I welcome the initiative by the minister and the new chair of ATSIC and the new board of ATSIC. Undoubtedly, those measures have been taken because of the concern that was expressed to me and the concerns that I have followed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total travel bill for ATSIC commissioners was $1 million for 1994&hyphen;95 and $1.5 million for 1995&hyphen;96. I just quickly say that the 1994&hyphen;95 figures did not tell the whole story. As a result, it is not appropriate to make the claim that travel and travel allowance payments jumped by half a million dollars between those two years. Might I also add that I do not begrudge the amount or the extent of the travel. The in globo figures that I have just mentioned do not really tell us very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individual figures, however, do leave room for speculation and it is important to the commissioners involved and for public transparency that explanations be provided. For example, in 1994&hyphen;95, the then ATSIC chair claimed $28,695 for travel allowance whilst the Tasmanian commissioner claimed $42,243, which was the highest amount. When you have those sorts of discrepancies, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1796"> I believe it is appropriate to ask for explanations. The travel allowances claimed for attending board meetings in 1994&hyphen;95 disclose a huge disparity between some not claiming anything up to a claim of $21,938.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Zone travel allowances for 1994&hyphen;95 also showed huge variations. Clearly, the size of the zones being represented is an important consideration and those living in larger zones will have greater claims. Yet, one of the smallest zones&mdash;namely, Tasmania&mdash;had a zone travel allowance claim to the sum of $20,615. In the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year, the highest claim for travel allowance was $68,495. This is an interesting figure, given the media speculation about senators' travel allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media apparently believes that the travel allowance claimed by some senators is excessive. I do not wish to comment on that aspect but the figures reported in today's media are in the vicinity of $100,000&hyphen;plus for a number of our colleagues. But that figure is compiled for the period from 1 July 1991 through to 3 March 1997&mdash;that is, some 5&frac34;years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if we undertake a simple multiplication&mdash;and when I say `simple', I used the calculator for this one&mdash;when we multiply $68,495 by 5.75 years, we get a total travel claim of $393,848 for that comparable period of time. In anyone's language, that is big money. So if it is justifiable to have inquiries into travel claims of over $100,000 accrued over five years for senators, it stands to reason that it is three times more justifiable for an inquiry into ATSIC commissioners' travel allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I do not draw any adverse inferences or conclusions in relation to those senators who have accrued large travel allowance claims; nor do I do so in relation to the ATSIC commissioners. But what I do say is that there is clearly room for the sort of investigation that is now going to be undertaken by the Director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, and I look forward to its determination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the Senate a plea on behalf of the Snowy River and its friends in the Snowy River Alliance, a representative group of concerned citizens and local organisations, and members of the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro. I wish to give voice to their concerns about the fate of the Snowy River, which is facing severe degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal, New South Wales and Victorian governments are set to corporatise the Snowy Mountains hydro&hyphen;electric scheme by 1 July this year. The Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Power Act 1949, to divert the waters of the Snowy River and its tributaries for additional irrigation security on the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers, has added value to the water by running it through electric turbines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country is certainly now a different place from what it was back then. In that period there seemed to be inexhaustible amounts of natural resources to exploit. While it is still true that `our land abounds in nature's gifts', we are now witnessing the long&hyphen;term harmful effects of decisions made about half a century ago. The Snowy River hydro&hyphen;electric scheme was undoubtedly one of the greatest engineering feats of modern times. It has a special place in the hearts of many Australians, particularly post&hyphen;war migrants who gained a sense of participating in the building of a new nation by working on the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But mistakes were made during the planning and building of the Snowy Mountains hydro&hyphen;electric scheme. One of the most significant was the decision to dam and divert virtually all of the Snowy River's water to the west of the Great Dividing Range without leaving enough water to keep the Snowy River flowing. A near&hyphen;empty riverbed has seen the river system stressed in places to the point of complete ecological collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The less than one per cent release of water from the Jindabyne Dam has placed the Snowy River in a state worse than any recorded through drought, and that is permanent. Environmental integrity has suffered so badly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1797"> that some visitors to the region will not believe that what they are seeing is the Snowy River. The Snowy River was a mighty river&mdash;powerful, and abundant in life. It has stirred emotions and invited literary tributes. It is time to rectify the mistake that was made half a century ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support for returning environmental flows on the Snowy is almost unanimous from all levels of government and the local community. Indeed, I acknowledge that evidently on radio this morning Premier Kennett of Victoria said something sympathetic. Premier Kennett is not a person I would normally use as an authority in support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the existing act was set up to divert most of the Snowy's flow, it was not the intention of planners to destroy the river. Unfortunately, the Snowy River communities have noted a lack of will to make the Snowy Mountains scheme meet the environmental standards of today. That is the challenge we must now face&mdash;to make the Snowy River something that we can be environmentally proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The communities have told me that they believe the issue has been hijacked by energy ministries given that they are preparing to corporatise the scheme. The energy departments have told local residents that the financial viability of the proposed corporation could be threatened if it were forced to meet scientists' demands and recommendations to return a flow to the river of about 28 per cent of its original volume. It is important that all industries operate with high environmental standards. The Snowy Mountains hydro scheme has a high public profile and a special place in the Australian psyche. But this electricity generator should not be allowed to devastate 450 kilometres of river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, the issue of environmental flows has been represented as a cost or revenue reduction by the energy bureaucrats. But the benefits of environmental flows are not just environmental; they are economic. In fact, if land and water conservation, environment and Treasury are looked at together rather than as separate portfolios, environmental flows represent a high return investment. For example, I am informed that one of the world's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> largest rafting companies has already shown keen interest in a revitalised Snowy River, and it estimates that it alone could generate revenue equivalent to the value of the released water. I know that Canberra representatives will note that because of the spin&hyphen;off advantages for this city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy River was also a world&hyphen;class recreational fishing resource and was the backbone of a huge catchment supporting a network of highly prized streams which has the potential to become a multimillion export earner for the fishing&hyphen;tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original purpose of the Snowy Mountains hydro scheme was to provide additional irrigation security for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin and the Murrumbidgee irrigation areas. The impact on these regions if a quarter of the Snowy River's water is returned to the Snowy must be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sustainability of irrigation dependent agriculture in the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin is more complex than the planners of half a century ago could have known. Rising water tables and resulting salinity have led to changes in vegetation and extensive land degradation. Deforestation, increased salinity and high water delivery losses pose real threats to the future of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A paper prepared for the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council dated 13 September 1996 stated that already half a million hectares of the basin's irrigated land, the most productive in the country, is thought to be affected by this land degradation. The worst affected land is already out of production and much more is expected to be retired as water tables continue to rise. Water use must accommodate the very significant constraints imposed by the nature of land and the hydrogeological processes. This is highlighted by the staggering losses of water during water delivery to the irrigation regions. According to the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission, 1,000 gigalitres of water per year are lost in the southern Murray basin. A thousand gigalitres is almost the full Snowy River diversion. These losses contribute significantly to rising water tables and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1798"> salinity problems which farmers in the basin face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With governments already investing through the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission into key areas of water losses, the opportunity exists to invest these water savings into environmental flows for rivers which currently do not have enough water. The fact that this waste has been identified makes the need to return water to the Snowy even more pressing. It is a contention of the Snowy River Alliance that we are sacrificing one of the great rivers of this country not for sound economic or environmental reasons but purely through inefficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy River is in a state of ecological collapse. The Snowy River Alliance argue that the hydro&hyphen;electric scheme was never constructed to be a stand&hyphen;alone profit making entity and the proven environmental benefits of returning water to the river far outweigh the possible cost involved. The solution is simple, they say: just add water.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1798"><TITLE>Work for the Dole Scheme</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The work for the dole scheme is a matter of great public interest. This afternoon the government will introduce in the other place the bills which are necessary to establish this scheme. They have said they want to move very quickly on this legislation so they can begin to get the ball rolling on setting up the programs which will be available under this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me, however, is that the legislation seems to be being rushed through the parliament long before the government has finalised how it will work in practice. We have been told that the initial work for the dole programs will involve 10,000 young unemployed Australians. We have also been told that these programs will be sponsored by organisations including community group and service clubs. What we have not been told, however, is exactly how many organisations are willing to offer such work for the dole programs or what kinds of activities they would be able to provide to unemployed people in their care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are putting the cart before the horse on this issue. They are introducing into the parliament the legislation necessary to establish the program long before they have thought through the nitty&hyphen;gritty detail and the mechanics of how this scheme will work. They seem almost to be making it up as they go along. It is like the people's convention: first of all they said, `We will tell you how the elected half of this convention will work, but we will tell you how the appointed half will be put in place only after you pass the legislation.' This is big picture first, details later, blank cheque legislation. That is how this government are operating at the moment. The government want to have the framework for this scheme in place by next week, but they then want to wait&mdash;to receive submissions from sponsors by July,  in order to settle the fine details by August. This is the same thing. We are being asked to give a big tick for the big picture first; we are supposed to take the important details on trust for later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that is good enough. We do not know enough about how the work for the dole scheme will work. The government has not been able to tell us. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was pressed on the first day he announced this, all he could think of as an example was, `We will get them to meet and greet tourists.' Yesterday, I did some research of my own. I wanted to get a better idea of which organisations&mdash;vaguely described as service and community organisations&mdash;would be willing to sponsor work for the dole programs. I asked my staff to ring and speak to a range of such organisations throughout Australia. We targeted urban and regional areas which had high levels of unemployment. The responses we received were both enlightening and interesting. A number of the organisations we spoke to said that they had not given much thought at all to providing jobs under this scheme. Others said that they would be willing to support the work for the dole program but they could not take on more than a few participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the 10 organisations we spoke to in Maryborough, Queensland, several&mdash;including the RSL&mdash;could offer three positions, while 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1799"> one organisation could offer only two. Out of the 10 organisations, only three said that they could offer any training at all to work for the dole participants. A  number of small and regional organisations we spoke to said they could not take on any participants at all, because they did not have the staff available to organise and supervise such a program. This was particularly the case in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several community organisations said they would not be willing to participate in such a scheme, because they did not support the principles which underlie it, while several others said they could only employ people who already had formal qualifications. Interestingly, in one rural area in Victoria with a high unemployment rate&mdash;and, therefore, one of the target areas for this program&mdash;almost half the organisations we spoke to said they were sorry but they could not see the point of work for the dole programs in their area, because there simply were no real work opportunities in their region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important issue was raised by the organisations we spoke to in the area of Logan in Queensland. Logan is an area on the outskirts of Brisbane which has little access to public transport. Several organisations said that making programs in the Logan area work would be very difficult because of these transport problems. The problem was not the cost of the transport but the simple unavailability of regular public transport. I wonder whether the government has even considered how this lack of public transport in many areas will impact on the success of their proposed work for the dole programs in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My research suggests that there are still a lot of aspects of this scheme which need to be considered and addressed. What sounds in theory easy and, indeed, appealing to many Australians&mdash;such as, `We will get 10,000 unemployed young Australians to work for the dole'&mdash;may in practice be a lot harder to set up. I am not saying that setting up a voluntary work for the dole scheme is a bad thing. In many ways, the Democrats are supportive of opportunities to give structure and purpose to the days of young unemployed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians. But, as we all know, in the long term they need training and real jobs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the government can demonstrate how the mechanics of the scheme will work, I think its positive aspects and its positive reception will be severely undermined. The matter of asking the parliament to give this piece of legislation a big tick almost immediately is very improper. It is unacceptable to say, `This is the big picture first. This is the framework. Everybody supports us. Trust us. We'll fill in the details later.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to have the details now. I believe the parliament has a right to see all the details now. We need to have confidence in all major aspects of the system we are being asked to pass as law before it becomes law and before we say, to however many Australians, `This is the way it is. Bad luck if the details are found out afterwards.' The government has a responsibility to provide those details now and not to seek a blank cheque for the rest. That is why I think this lack of detail is a great matter of public interest.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1799"><TITLE>Antarctica: AAP Mawson's Huts Foundation</TITLE>

In addition to the project launched last night to save Australia's most significant Antarctic heritage site, this year will also see the 50th anniversary of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition. In February of 1947 the government, with the help of Sir Douglas Mawson, established ANARE, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition. In December of that same year, the first expedition landed on our sub&hyphen;Antarctic territory of Heard Island.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1800">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this year of celebration all those who have undertaken ANARE voyages over the last 50 years have been invited to participate in literally dozens of functions and reunions across Australia. As part of those celebrations, Australia's perhaps best known ANARE expeditioner in recent times, Tim Bowden, will release the ANARE jubilee history entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Silence Calling: Australians in the Antarctica 1947&hyphen;97</EMPHASIS>. Any senator who enjoyed the ABC series will no doubt find this history fascinating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year will also see a significant re-evaluation of Australia's Antarctic direction. Australia's current Antarctic policy was effectively set during the Cold War at a time when territorial issues were of far greater significance than they are today. Much has changed since then. It is now time for the Australian government to review all aspects of its Antarctic program and to provide a strategy for the first part of the next millennium. Australia's territorial obligations are being examined. Air transport, along with other forms of Antarctic travel, is under review. Tourism and the role the private sector might play in the future need to be examined now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1911 Sir Douglas Mawson recognised the importance to Australia and the rest of the world of Antarctic research. I suspect though that not even Mawson could have envisaged the level of importance that the world's scientific community would place upon Antarctic research into global climate change some 80 years on. The priorities of Australia's scientific research program are under review. We intend to build upon the reputation we have earned in the field of subzero research since Mawson's day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year, 1997, will as well be significant in that there is every expectation that the Madrid protocol&mdash;an agreement adopted by Australia and signed in 1993 and which will ensure greater levels of environmental protection for the Antarctic&mdash;will be ratified by the remaining non-signatory nations so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this makes for an exciting year and should see an increased awareness of Australia's leading and pioneering role in the Antarctic. The Australian government has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long recognised the importance of Mawson's Huts to our nation's heritage. It is not only commendable but also appropriate that the private sector has taken the lead in conserving this significant part of our nation's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Douglas Mawson was well aware of the role the private sector could play in the Antarctic. Indeed, his first and subsequent expeditions were partially funded by the private sector through donations in both cash and kind. I understand that much of the timber used to build Mawson's Huts was donated by the long&hyphen;established and well&hyphen;known Sydney timber supplier, Hudsons. The same tradition of private sector involvement was resurrected by the AAP group last night with the formation of the foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, the Commonwealth's contribution to the 1911 expedition was &pound;2,000. It was indeed pleasing to hear from the Treasurer last night that the Treasury has become more generous in the last 80 years. Mr Costello was able to announce last night that legislation would shortly be  introduced into the parliament to allow tax deduction for donations to this very worthwhile cause. We will be hoping that the Senate will support that legislation when it is brought to this chamber. As an aside, I mention that in 1911 the New South Wales government gave more than three times the Commonwealth's contribution. The foundation would be hoping that the current New South Wales government will be equally as generous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project to save Mawson's Huts will be our last opportunity. The Antarctic adventurers Don and Margie McIntyre spent a full year only metres away from Mawson's Huts. They readily testify to the fact that these huts are situated in what is recognised as the world's windiest region. It is nothing short of a miracle that the huts are still standing. Perhaps the resilience of the huts is rivalled only by that of Mawson himself. Recent assessments have indicated that only ice and snow hold the huts together. For obvious reasons, the huts cannot now be moved to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AAP has set itself a challenging task in organising, through this foundation, the restoration of Mawson's Huts. Needless to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1801"> say, the government, by the good offices of the Australian Heritage Commission and the Australian Antarctic Division, fully supports the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist with the promotion of the AAP Mawson's Huts Foundation, a number of Mawson's Huts Foundation ambassadors have been appointed. These great Australasians have each demonstrated a particular affinity with either Mawson's Huts or with Australia's Antarctic territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my very great pleasure last night to announce that the following people had been appointed as Mawson's Huts Foundation ambassadors. They are the conqueror of Mount Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary, a charming and entertaining gentleman with whom I had the pleasure of dining last night; well&hyphen;known corporate identity and longstanding Mawson's Huts champion, Sir Peter Derham; the former director of the Australian Antarctic Division, Dr Phillip Law, under whose direction the first permanent Australian station in Antarctica was established; the well-known TV presenter and presenter of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Breaking the Ice</EMPHASIS> series and the author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Silence Calling: Australians in Antarctica 1947&hyphen;1997</EMPHASIS>, Mr Tim Bowden; and the Antarctic adventurers whom I mentioned previously, Don and Margie McIntyre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Senate, and certainly on behalf of the government, I congratulate those ambassadors and thank them for their help and commitment in taking on this role of publicising the foundation and the fundraising of the foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to publicly recognise the AAP group for the establishment of the foundation and the work they have done in that regard, and in particular to mention two senior executives of the AAP group, Mr David Jensen and Mr Greg Holland, who have been the driving forces in this significant initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would also be remiss of me if I did not mention Sir Peter Derham's contribution to the foundation. Sir Peter has long championed the saving of the huts. Without his energy and persistence, the foundation would not have become the reality it did last night.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to place on record and recognise the contribution to the foundation by the Governor-General, His Excellency Sir William Deane, who made his contribution by his acceptance of the role of patron of that foundation. This foundation is one which I am sure all Australians will support because it is so important that the foundation's fundraising succeeds so that Australia can save that very significant part of our heritage.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1801"><TITLE>Regional Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity in this debate on matters of public interest to make some comments about regional Australia. At mining sites in Western Australia about 8,000 people fly in and out each week. I believe that we should encourage, where possible, people to move their families and settle in regional Australia. The long&hyphen;term viability of their work and the benefit to the community justifies this commitment to decentralisation. By settling permanently, more work is created and a much needed boost is delivered to these transit towns and surrounding regions. There is more business for service industries, and bigger populations warrant more public spending and justify more infrastructure investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a substantial social benefit. These isolated communities have few full&hyphen;time members. A transitory population justifiably makes little investment in townships. The anthropologist Margaret Mead had it absolutely correct when she said that mobility is not helpful to building civilisation. If we want to engender community spirit and community benefit, we certainly do not do that by having a non-permanent population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents of Sydney and Melbourne now account for 38.9 per cent of Australia's total population. In my own state of New South Wales, 61.9 per cent of the population lives in Sydney. The city is literally bursting at the seams and suffering the social and environmental consequences of its urban sprawl.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The depopulation of most rural and regional areas is one of the biggest tests we face in government. We need to do two things. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1802"> need to make changes which encourage people to move to regional areas and to implement policies which stop the flow of people out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our first year of government the coalition has made many changes which are already benefiting regional Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the extremely difficult economic situation we inherited from the previous government, the diesel fuel rebate was retained. In late January the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced that it is not on the agenda for this year's pre&hyphen;budget deliberations. This rebate is crucial to the ongoing viability of the mining and agricultural sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just prior to Christmas, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, secured $81.5 million to extend the drought relief payment scheme. This is on top of the $170 million delivered in drought assistance payments allocated in our first year of government&mdash;money which has made a great deal of difference to rural Australia and to the families who received that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional Australians will also benefit from a significant slice of the $803 million allocated in the Commonwealth roads program. More than 90 per cent of this money will be spent in regional areas; spending which is critical to continued regional development and exports. Safer regional roads are also a coalition priority. More than $140 million will be spent on the black spot road safety program over the next four years. At least half of that money will be spent in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional tourism has also been a winner in our first year: $10 million has been allocated to the industry. That money has been used to help attract tourists, to encourage the balance between tourism and environmental protection, to build successful partnerships with indigenous people and to encourage developments with national relevance. There are also the changes to the export market development grants scheme which allows for tourist operators to access the help that the EMDG scheme provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sustain the long&hyphen;term future of the environment and agriculture, we are about to embark on the most exciting environmental program in this country's history&mdash;that is, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust. It will see real investment for the benefit of all of us but especially for those in rural and regional areas, where thousands of committed volunteers in communities large and small are using local knowledge to identify and solve local problems such as soil erosion and salinity. The applications for the first round of grants under the Natural Heritage Trust close in early April and I encourage any community group that wishes to make an application to get it in before then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is another area where much progress has already been made. Increased competition will lead to better services and lower costs. Upgraded telephone exchanges will provide benefits such as faster faxes, better mobile phone reception, faster EFTPOS services for business and faster access to the Internet. Price caps will be put in place and those in rural areas will benefit from cross&hyphen;subsidisation and a new $250 million fund to help bring communications in rural areas up to capital city standards. These examples represent part of what we have done, but we propose to do more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that more people are not moving to rural and remote areas is that we are not providing the incentive for them to move. Some of these incentives are not expensive and, anyway, on any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis they are attractive. Let us take fringe benefits tax on remote housing as an example. In the lead&hyphen;up to the 1996 election, we committed ourselves to removing the fringe benefits tax from the housing supplied by primary producers for their workers. This was implemented in our first budget and the new ruling takes effect on 1 April. Although it will cost $10 million in the first year, this 100 per cent concession is exactly the kind of support this sector needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fringe benefits tax still applies to remote area housing in mining and other isolated communities. In towns such as Kalgoorlie and Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory this fringe benefits tax still applies. In the Burke shire in the north&hyphen;west of Queensland, and similar remote regions, it has been estimated that building costs are 90 per cent above Brisbane building prices. Dwell 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1803"> ings have to be built to withstand natural disasters, using materials attracting expensive freight costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is compounded in the following scenario: an employer wants to attract skilled, well&hyphen;trained staff such as a chef or specialist tour guide but to house this employee and their family would cost thousands of dollars. A three&hyphen;bedroom house built especially for them has a negligible market value on completion. When calculating the fringe benefits tax payable on a dwelling, the owner must also take into consideration any free or subsidised domestic electricity, gas or oil which is provided for or paid on behalf of the employee occupying that dwelling. It is asking a lot of an employer to provide housing and then pay FBT on top of the cost. It is practically prohibitive. I believe the application of fringe benefits tax in this instance is a potential area for review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The zonal tax rebate is another measure which needs review. For these purposes, Australia is divided into two zones, A and B, and the rebate is paid on varying scales according to where you live. In the Australian master tax guide, zone A comprises those areas where the factors of isolation, uncongenial climate and the high cost of living are more pronounced. Zone B comprises less badly affected areas. In addition, certain particularly isolated areas are classified as special areas of zones A and B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commissioner of Taxation draws up a list of eligible towns falling in the special areas and they are generally more than 250 kilometres, by the shortest practical surface route, from the nearest urban centre with a 1981 census figure of 2,500 or more people. A taxpayer who is a resident of these special areas of zones A and B is eligible for $1,173, plus 50 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. A resident of zone A is eligible for $338 per year, plus 50 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. A resident of zone B is entitled to $57 per year, plus 20 per cent of the relevant rebate amount. If we want a zonal tax rebate system to be effective, we have to be a bit more generous than those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need policies that will make it possible for people to feel that we have a commitment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to decentralisation. We need to promote investment in remote areas, with a subsequent increase in employment for both whites and indigenous Australians. We must also use the existing infrastructure we have and provide more. We must have policies that compensate in some way for the isolation experienced by many people who live in these out&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;way places in regional Australia which are, by contemporary standards, very inhospitable. We must have policies which provide an incentive for people to populate the remote and regional areas of Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that a `great goal of the government is a sustainable future for rural and regional Australia'. There is much more to be done if this aim is to be achieved.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1803"><TITLE>Radio Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter of public interest&mdash;the future of Radio Australia. On 13 February this year, the Senate determined that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee should conduct an inquiry into the role and future of Radio Australia and Australia Television. In particular, the terms of reference of that inquiry were directed to considering the contribution made by Radio Australia and Australia Television to Australia's foreign policy and trade interests, particularly in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference were also directed to looking at the activities of similar foreign broadcast services in the region and most importantly, I would suggest, looking at the consequences if Radio Australia and/or Australia Television were to be closed. That Senate reference was carried by the Senate without objection from any senator or any party or group represented herein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has expeditiously commenced its inquiry. I am advised that it has already received around 800 submissions from people and groups both in Australia and overseas. The committee had the opportunity last week to visit the headquarters of Radio Australia in Melbourne and Australia Television in Sydney, and to commence taking evidence at public hearing. As I have indicat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1804"> ed previously in the Senate, the committee anticipates, and is certainly working towards, completing its inquiry and tabling a report and any recommendations by early May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry arose out of the Mansfield report. That report, as is well known, was commissioned by the government into the broad range of ABC services. The government commissioned it last year, after it had announced that funding for the ABC would be cut by some $55 million per year, and the report was conducted by Bob Mansfield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is well known and has been discussed and debated quite widely throughout the community and in the media&mdash;and, I might say, extensively within our region&mdash;Bob Mansfield recommended that the ABC should be released from its requirement to operate international broadcasting services and be permitted to direct the resulting savings to its core business of domestic broadcast. I am here quoting from page 6 of Mr Mansfield's report. At page 41 of his report, where he dealt with the subject of international broadcasters, Mr Mansfield made it very clear that his recommendations with respect to Radio Australia and Australia Television resulted from the bottom line financial position that the ABC had been placed in. He went on to particularly acknowledge that he had not looked at the foreign policy dimension. In the report, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept that the question of future overseas broadcasting activities has a foreign policy dimension. In its submission, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) considered the review should take account of `the significant role the ABC's International services play in advancing Australia's trade and diplomatic objectives'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Mansfield then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have some difficulty in identifying the extent to which the ABC plays such a role and, if it does, the extent to which it is effective in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further down page 41 of his report, after referring to the particular arrangements that exist in the BBC World Service, where they have an agreement with the corresponding department of the government over there, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of such agreement&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, such an agreement applying with respect to the ABC and DFAT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">concerning objectives and priorities, it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of funding or to revise priorities for overseas broadcasting services, particularly for RA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 42 of his report he went on to discuss very briefly what the estimated audience of Radio Australia was. Very importantly, he then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For an investment of more than $20 million a year, I consider the Government should be in a position to determine whether:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the service is reaching its target audience;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the type and mix of programming remains valid; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> shortwave remains the most cost&hyphen;effective means of delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the limited evidence put before the review, I consider that there is insufficient evidence for the Government to draw firm conclusions in any of these areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Mansfield, in making his recommendation that Radio Australia and ATV could be dispensed with, closed down, sold off or whatever, was clearly acknowledging that he was not considering any of the foreign policy or trade implications and that he certainly was not considering what was happening with international broadcasting around the world and particularly in our region. The fact of the matter is that Mr Mansfield simply did not have the time to consider in any detail those issues. Moreover, and more importantly, Mr Mansfield acknowledged that it was not part of his brief, and I will come to that shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, arising out of the public outcry, debate and discussion that occurred following Mr Mansfield's recommendations, I moved in the Senate, and the Senate agreed, that it would be appropriate for the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee to undertake an investigation of these issues, to seek out information as to, for instance, the audience reach, the importance of short&hyphen;wave technology, and the importance of continuing with international broadcasting in the region and the impact of that upon our foreign policy and trade objectives. As I said, the Senate committee is undertaking that process and it will, I am sure, be able to provide to the Minister for Communications and the Arts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1805"> (Senator Alston) and to the government the information upon which it and the ABC can make a properly considered decision about whether Radio Australia continues to exist and how it should be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these comments because it is of great concern to me&mdash;and it should be of concern to the Senate and the parliament&mdash;that the minister is treating the committee and the parliament with contempt, in my view, and is pushing on headlong with his own view that Radio Australia should be gutted and ATV should be sold off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point firstly to an interview that the minister gave on 28 February when he was interviewed on the Radio National breakfast program. I quote from a transcript of that interview. In response to a question from Julie Posetti who asked him about the Senate inquiry, Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's fair to say that Cabinet will consider the issue on its merits and, to the extent that it believes that Australia should retain a presence in some form, then it would obviously have to look at how that ought to be funded. Now, to date, I think Mansfield's made a pretty powerful case. There's been a lot of emotive reaction to it but I haven't seen any sort of in&hyphen;depth analysis that demonstrates either the effectiveness of the service or a significant demand for it. There may well be that evidence, but you would have expected it to have been put before Mansfield, and it wasn't, and Radio Australia has obviously had every opportunity to mount their case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a gross distortion of the truth. It is nothing more than misinformation being peddled out in the public arena to try and discredit the inquiry and to discredit Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in that interview, was stating that Radio Australia had been given every opportunity to put its position on these very important issues. That is simply untrue. Mr Mansfield himself was questioned about this issue in an interview, also on Radio National, on Wednesday, 26 February. I quote from the transcript of that interview, where Mr Mansfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you look at my terms of reference, I only had to look at the ABC. I didn't have the task and wasn't asked to look at Australia's foreign policy. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in the interview, the reporter David Spicer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two weeks ago, a Senate inquiry was announced into the future of Radio Australia and Australia Television. Bob Mansfield says it's a good move.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then they cut to a comment by Bob Mansfield who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just didn't have the instruction to take into account the foreign affairs implications. And I think the Government in appointing the Senate committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">note the slip: the `government' in appointing the Senate committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to look into it, wants that looked into, and I have no problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was then asked by David Spicer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you did have that foreign affairs input, would you perhaps have couched it differently?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bob Mansfield replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without looking at it, I can't give you that answer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">David Spicer then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But do you have a view, though, on the foreign affairs implications of axing Radio Australia?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bob Mansfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without looking at the fact, I don't have. I mean, I'm just not informed of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">David Spicer asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Radio Australia stays, if the foreign affairs argument wins, where should the ABC make their cuts then?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bob Mansfield replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, that's for management and the board to look at. That wasn't part of my task.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is completely contrary to the misinformation being peddled by the minister when he was endeavouring to suggest that Bob Mansfield was looking at this issue and that Radio Australia had an opportunity to put its views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then what do we come to? We come to an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> last Sunday. The issue was raised on the program by Piers Akerman when he asked Richard Alston, the minister, if the government believed that Radio Australia and Australia Television should survive? The transcript shows the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, again, Mansfield's view was that ATV ought to be sold off, and that's been our view, subject to retention of news and current affairs arrangements, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1806"> and he says that if we can't do that by 30 June, then we ought to close the service down.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I might interpose here and point out that that was not Senator Alston's view when he chaired the Senate select committee looking at the operations of the ABC only two years ago. At that time, he said that ATV should continue to exist and should, if it could not turn a profit, be funded by separate budgetary allocation. But we now know that either he did not really subscribe to that view or he has radically changed his mind. The minister further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, it is out to tender at the moment. We've had something like 30 expressions of interest and, as I understand it, the ABC is progressing those arrangements. As far as Radio Australia is concerned, Mansfield identified that it was a declining technology&mdash;short wave is of dramatically less significance in this day and age&mdash;and even Foreign Affairs has very serious question marks about the effectiveness of the service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is another total distortion of the facts. As was clearly identified in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , and in evidence given to the Senate committee last week by Mr Michael Bird, there is in fact an increase of investment being undertaken into short&hyphen;wave transmission. The article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  quotes Mr Nigel Holmes, Radio Australia's transmission manager, and identifies the fact that various international broadcasters&mdash;the Voice of America, the BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, the German overseas broadcast service, Radio Japan and Radio Free Asia&mdash;are all putting increased investment into short&hyphen;wave transmission. Mr Holmes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortwave is still the number&hyphen;one medium for international broadcasting in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know who these nameless, faceless people are who are advising Senator Alston that short wave is dead but they are quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It should be of great concern to the Senate that here we have a minister peddling misinformation and distorting the facts out there in the public arena at the same time as we have a Senate committee in the process of gathering that information. That committee will be in a position to report to the parliament and to the government by early May&mdash;that is, before the budget is handed down. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is also the fact that this minister is determined to gut Radio Australia and ATV. That is clearly what he has in store when the government Expenditure Review Committee looks at the issue next week. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Minister, I refer to your criticism on radio of the DSS teleservice on 28 February when you gave the figure of 400,000 calls received in one day in January.

Could these calls have something to do with the fiasco which resulted in 36,700 duplicate and triplicate concession cards and 98,000 other cards being sent late? Could the inordinate number of phone calls in January, leading to 40&hyphen;minute delays, have had something to do with the changes to superannuation for over&hyphen;55s and the scrapping of the minimum payment for the youth training allowance on 1 January?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very nice of Senator Mackay to ask me that question. One of the reasons that there has always been a problem ever since the Labor government introduced the teleservice system is that there is a massive increase in review activity over the summer period with families' incomes and payments et cetera having to be reviewed. That is one of the major drivers of business on the teleservice lines. Even more importantly than that perhaps is the fact that when the teleservice system was set up it was set up with inadequate research and funding, and insufficient people. That is the reason why a few weeks ago I announced a major exercise of investment in people and equipment that will improve the teleservice system so that we can offer better service to our customers.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nevertheless, it is an unsatisfactory service that we are currently providing; nobody is pretending differently. We are determined to improve it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all signs of a strengthening economy, Senator Coonan, but what is important is that young Australians, those who suffered so much under the previous Labor government, are given a fair opportunity. That is why this coalition government has introduced a range of initiatives particularly to try to get young Australians out of the spiral of depression into which so many have fallen. One of the schemes is the work for the dole scheme. It is heartening that it has been embraced so enthusiastically by young people. It really does tell you something when we find in one survey that 65 per cent of young people said that they were in favour; in other words, they said it would be a good idea if young people who were unemployed were contributing to the cost of their dole by taking some form of employment&mdash;65 per cent for; 29 per cent against. Young people believe that the Howard government is heading in the right direction in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is Labor on this issue? It is all over the shop as it is on so many issues. What did Senator Faulkner say when he was first asked about it? He said that work for the dole is nothing more than `poll&hyphen;driven tokenism'. That is not what the young people say. The young people are looking to the future a bit more positively. What did Mr Crean then say? Contrary to Senator Faulkner, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor supported and initiated a work for the dole scheme, but we didn't call it that. It was a concept that we called reciprocal obligation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make is that indicators&mdash;and you will be pleased to hear this Senator Murray because of your interest in this&mdash;for the manufacturing industry are pointing towards a pick up in 1997. Recent housing finance and building approvals data suggests that dwelling investments will strengthen in 1997 and strong growth in retail sales in January 1997 combined with improved consumer confidence point to increased consumer demand. Restructuring in the manufacturing industry is also helping the industry become more internationally competitive with continuing strong export growth of 10.5 per cent in the last 12 months.

Minister, are you aware that some universities help arrange repayment deferred bank loans for students undertaking HECS liable courses which include a substantial fee component&mdash;for example, aviation courses?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Crowley, I cannot answer that question for you at the moment. I will make some inquiries with the universities to see what they do&mdash;but I realise that is not the thrust of your questions&mdash;and I will check for you the nature of inclusion as expenditure of any loans that fall under that category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that some people would not like any loans at all considered as expenditure in an actual means test. For example, there would be some people who would say that, if a family on a rural property with significant assets has sufficient funds to borrow money to send three kids 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down to private schools, that loan&mdash;which is expended in that year&mdash;ought not to be counted as their actual means. There would be plenty of others who would say, yes, it should be, because if that family has the assets and income to borrow such an amount of money and send three kids to private schools and board them, it is an indication that their actual means are quite significant. That is the purpose of the actual means test. That is why your party introduced it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Loans are treated differently, depending on what they are for. For example, if you expended all the money from a loan on a house which you were going to keep forever and a day, that would not be included. Let me check for you on the nature of the loans you are referring to&mdash;I will come back as quickly as I can and give you an answer with respect to those. But let me give you the general answer that if you had a loan for a house, that money would all be expended in one year but it would not be sensible to include that as your actual means. But a loan, for example, to send three kids to a private school in a capital city should, in my view, be included as actual means. I will get an answer on where the loans you are referring to fit in and come back to you.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, if your party wants to claim that all those people who have the asset and income backing combination to satisfy banks that they can they make very substantial loans and that those loans ought not be considered as their actual means, I look forward to you running that case. But you will be making the argument then that the sort of family that can send three kids to a private boarding school in a capital city should not have that expenditure counted as expenditure because it is a loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might also like to be aware, Senator Crowley, of the difficulties&mdash;I am sure you are, in any event&mdash;in saying that loan ex

Because if I were an accountant or a tax lawyer what I might do is suggest that the family set up a trust and borrow the money from a family trust&mdash;hence the money that was being expended would be loan expenditures and would not be counted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice  asked by Senator Forshaw today, relating to the site for a second airport for Sydney and the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first thing to note is the surprising amount of detail that Senator Alston had in his brief on this issue. Much of it of course was information that we already know, that has been on the public record for some time. But what it demonstrates is that the government has become very aware of the concern of the people of Sydney, and particularly of the Sutherland Shire in the electorate of Hughes, regarding the deceit and misinformation that is being peddled around by this government over the issue of the location of Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I believe is happening is a cover up here. Last Sunday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> exposed the secret agenda of this government&mdash;the agenda whereby Holsworthy would become the site for Sydney's second airport. Many thousands of people already believe that that decision has been made by this government and was made some time ago. And as each day goes by, they become increasingly convinced of that because of the leaks that are coming out of the government and because of the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;record statements being made by people associated with the government and the department about what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government's real agenda is. Because this has been exposed to the public in the press last week there is clearly now a cover up going on, an attempt  by ministers to still maintain a fiction that they are committed to an airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just look at some of the things that have occurred very recently. For instance, a couple of weeks ago we had the leak that the government had been considering the establishment of a nuclear waste reprocessing unit at Lucas Heights. This was exposed in the press&mdash;and what did we see? We saw the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) try to weasel his way out by saying that it was only a proposal they were looking at. The fact of the matter is that that has been very seriously considered by this government. Of course, there has never been any indication to the people of the area prior to the election that this was on the agenda&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the government knows the views of the council and people of the Sutherland Shire about any further extension of the Lucas Heights facility. So that was exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then it comes out, by virtue of a leaked memo, that the government has also been looking at the proposal to locate the airport at Holsworthy in conjunction with a relocation of the Lucas Height facility&mdash;again tying the two sites, the two issues, together. If one reads the leaked memo that is now quite publicly available&mdash;and the minister himself acknowledged in his answer that it exists&mdash;we note that it states that the adviser to Mr McGauran indicated that he met with Lachlan McComish the adviser to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), that they discussed the location of the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights and&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport, mainly due to the build&hyphen;up of residential housing in the area since the site was first proposed. He believes that Holsworthy will be selected as the preferred site, subject to a satisfactory outcome of the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Isn't it interesting to note that one of the reasons given by the minister some time ago as to why Holsworthy was put on the agenda was the residential build&hyphen;up around Badgerys 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1820"> Creek? But then the memo goes on to talk about how the option should be seriously considered of relocating the reactor and putting the airport at Holsworthy. And this is the real nub. Finally, the memo states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be political advantages in making the relocation of the Lucas Heights facility an integral part of the Holsworthy airport package. The removal of the dangerous Lucas Heights reactor to a more suitable location would be welcomed by the Sutherland Shire and may partly negate the negative impact of the new airport. There would be problems with finding a new site for the reactor but the possible use of Commonwealth land at Jervis Bay may be an option.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he goes on to recommend that serious consideration should be given to this and discussions take place with the minister. The people of the Sutherland Shire are not going to be bribed by these sorts of disgraceful actions by this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that the Labor Party is starting to move into the mode of trying to win back some of the seats that they lost. Senator Forshaw seems to be acknowledging that by the wry smile on his face. This clearly is a Labor Party beat&hyphen;up designed to win back some of the seats such as Hughes that they lost in such a devastating fashion at the last election. You have mentioned the name of Danna Vale&mdash;and what a fantastic member for Hughes she is. She will outdo your former failed minister, Robert Tickner, who was the holder of that seat, each and every day. She has been a great campaigner for the people of Hughes and, what is more, will continue to be after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does the Australian Labor Party no good to come into this place trying to beat up issues in their desperate bid to win back seats. The only way that the Labor Party are going to win back their seats is by coming up with some decent policy proposals and, above all, by saying sorry for the mistakes of the past. But they cannot come at that, so what do they do? They engage in these campaigns of misinformation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The media reports about what occurred between an office member of Mr McGauran, et cetera, are really all a beat-up. What has occurred is that this so-called information is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not of any official government status. The best it could be labelled as is `rejected advice' which dates back to 15 June 1996. One wonders if the department may have developed that document as part of the process for the former Labor government, keeping in mind that that document only arose some three months after the election. One wonders if the wheels of the bureaucracy were still spitting out the views of the previous Labor government at that time. Senator Forshaw, let me warn you: be very careful when you embark upon these campaigns of trying to undermine the very successful work of the member for Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to the nuclear reactor, there has been discussion about the various sites. It is only proper that the government do consider those. But it should also be kept in mind that the minister has made quite clear public statements about this matter. Why Senator Forshaw&mdash;undoubtedly with the support and connivance of the Labor Party&mdash;would want to come in here trying to revive that issue is beyond me, other than once again it is part of the campaign they believe will assist them in winning the marginal seat of Hughes. Statistically Hughes might be marginal but, because of Danna Vale's hard work, I am sure it is no longer marginal and that she will win it again at the next election with a bigger margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There was a media release in May 1996 which announced that the environmental impact statement would be broadened to include alternative sites. It is appropriate that the government considers all possibilities when weighing up the options.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up the challenge given by the coalition through Senator Abetz. I notice that the 180,000 people of Sutherland shire in the city of Sydney can make up their minds. I appreciate that the coalition have dragged out their Tasmanian senator with his legal skills to try to cover up, but they did not give him a brief; so my colleague Senator Forshaw has exposed his lack of knowledge of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are happy to take on the coalition parties because they have a long history of being devious and sneaky on this issue of the second airport at Sydney. I remind you, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Deputy President, that on 28 May 1996 I asked a question of Senator Parer, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, in which I drew attention to the fact that Senator Parer signed off the report as chairman of the aircraft noise select committee which included a statement that `embarking on another lengthy process of site evaluation will only postpone a new quite urgent decision' in referring to Badgerys Creek. But we were not told before the election that, at the very time he was signing the document, the leadership of the Liberal Party was dealing with the Lawrence Hargrave project consortium in doing a sleazy deal on the people of Sutherland to try to foist an airport on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have a leaked document, and it is a very revealing document. I just want to deal with a particular aspect of it, because it shows the consistency in the Liberal and National parties position. The document refers to the fact that there has been housing in the area around Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to another speech that I made on 30 November 1995. So we do not come to this issue as some sort of stunt; we have been campaigning on this issue&mdash;a vital issue to the people of Sydney. I refute Senator Abetz's suggestion that this is some sort of a Labor Party beat-up. I will quote myself&mdash;I do not know of a better authority&mdash;when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also propose in relation to the Sydney West airport that we ask the state Labor government in New South Wales to repair the damage that Liberal coalition governments in New South Wales caused at a state level by allowing estates to be built in the flight path in the west of Sydney. Over the last few years the Fahey and Greiner governments have allowed estates to be built under where those flight paths will be, and people in the west of Sydney might be affected by that.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point that we drew attention to during that inquiry, and that citizens raised with us, is that the Liberal&hyphen;National party coalition governments in New South Wales allowed at least five major estates to develop in the west of Sydney. Is it any wonder that people in the west of Sydney and people in the Sutherland Shire know that you can expect two faces of the coalition: one is the soft sell, personified by Mr Howard, telling them things will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1822"> easy, and the other is the reality of what is foisted on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Sutherland, you have a proposal now, which this document highlights. The government is going forward with the idea that there is a real selection process when this leaked document shows there is not. The hidden agenda is exposed yet again and the people of Sutherland can prepare the most massive campaign that they will ever have to be involved in to fight this development. They can expect the Liberal member for Hughes to be in an impossible position because it is her government that it is making the decision and she genuinely attempts to space herself away from her own government. The sleight of hand as far as the reactor is concerned will not allow her to be able to disown her government and her Prime Minister, the people who negotiated the deal in the first place.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I asked Senator Vanstone, in my question, to confirm the accuracy of something which purports to be an exclusive report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> . Senator Vanstone did not confirm the accuracy of that report, but it did seem to me that in her answer she did seem to be saying to us, `Yes, the work for the dole legislation which is going to be introduced has to have legislative approval. That legislative approval is going to be reasonably open and, therefore, even though we are starting with pilot projects for 10,000 unemployed young Australians, it is true that the legislation will have the capacity to be implemented in the future for all unemployed Australians without further parliamentary debate. I do not think that is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is appropriate to have a trial&mdash;for us, preferably, on a voluntary basis&mdash;and to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say to 10,000 young Australians: this is the way it is going to work and at the end of six months we are going to evaluate how the scheme went. We could ask, for example: what did you get out of it; what kind of tasks were you asked to do; and what kind of training did you receive as part of this six months `work'? I think people would say that a trial has merit. I think they would say it has real merit if the evidence that comes in shows that there was real training and there were real jobs, as a by&hyphen;product, at the end it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it really concerns me that, in order to put a trial in place, we are being asked to give a big tick to legislation that has the capacity to make it compulsory for all unemployed Australians to meet the requirements that they work for the dole. I hope, when we learn more of the detail, that that is wrong. I certainly would be wanting to put a sunset clause in place, not because I disapprove of the government's proposal to have a trial but because I think it is wrong not to come back to this parliament having evaluated the results of that trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of other comments about the issue generally. Firstly, the government relies very heavily on polls, which show a high level of community support, particularly for young Australians. Those polls are genuine polls. But it would be good for the polls to then go back and say, `Do you think the government should have to provide you with a few basic details before it puts in place a law compelling all unemployed Australians to roll up for work for the dole schemes?' I would be interested in that answer. Or to ask Australians: if the trial unfortunately did not produce the kind of results we were hoping for, would it be a good thing to have legislation already in place which would have an impact on all future unemployed Australians? We need to go on and ask them a few more specific questions, having asked them whether they approve of the work for the dole program in concept. I hope we will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask them too what they think about a scheme on which the government makes an announcement on the big picture details without having ready the fine detail of who the sponsors will be and what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1823"> kind of tasks young people will be asked to do. I think it is the wrong way round. We are asking parliament to pass this before Easter, but we are not asking sponsors to nominate until July and we are not intending to finalise the approval process until August, putting people in place by September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done a ring around of various organisations that I thought would qualify under the government's loose terminology of `community and service organisations' and I think there are so many details that are still unknown that we should be asking the government to come to us and say, `We have firm offers from these organisations for this many young people and we are going to ask them to do these specific tasks. And, yes, in X number of cases we will be able to provide training.' I would really think it is fairer for the parliament, before being asked to vote on this important thing, to have those details first.</PARA></SPEECH>

Self&hyphen;esteem and some regard for oneself as a human being enables young people to withstand some of the other problems they face&mdash;problems such as the appalling temptations that are in their path with drugs and other miseries that relate to not having a job, having no self&hyphen;esteem in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the beginning of 1996, 234,000 young unemployed 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in this country were looking for work and were unable to find it. These are shameful statistics. Young people actually represented 38 per cent of all unemployed Australians. They were the people who had absolutely no hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this scheme will do is provide for at least 10,000 unemployed in pilot schemes. It will help the young kids aged between 18 to 24 who have been unemployed for longer than six months. You would think that, in those circumstances, this sort of scheme would be greeted with great enthusiasm by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1824"> the opposition. It is important not only that this scheme is being offered but that there is a bit of bipartisan support for something that is as critical in providing some assistance to kids who otherwise have had very little to hope for and look forward to in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time not only for the Labor Party but also for the Democrats to accept that work for the dole offers some positive benefits. They should support the scheme and not be so critical before the scheme even gets an opportunity to be properly tested.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up on the last part of Senator Coonan's contribution to the motion to take note of the answers by Senator Vanstone and Senator Hill. I am not in the business of knocking work for the dole. But I am in the business of trying to find out from the government exactly what you plan to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government we implemented a whole raft of plans that actually created several hundred thousand jobs, not just 10,000 potential opportunities. We have no idea at all what you intend for these people. You called those schemes `the road to nowhere' schemes, dead&hyphen;end schemes, that provided people with no real opportunity at a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I remember Senator Parer talking about `real jobs' created by the private sector. I also heard Senator Hill saying that economic growth is going to be generated through the private sector. I would like to remind Senator Hill of a statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the manufacturing sector plans to reduce by another 7,000. That is the sort of approach that the manufacturing sector of this country's industry is taking to how well this government is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to this question of bipartisan support. Well, we will support the scheme. We do not have a problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will give it a chance when we see on paper the real outline of what you are proposing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan might be interested to know that the numbers of long&hyphen;term unemployed actually increased again just recently.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are saying that you are going to provide some 10,000 opportunities nationwide. Under the Working Nation program we committed something in the order of $4 billion over four years. I have to say that in many respects that program was no different to work for the dole; it was another form of work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we committed additional funds to provide appropriate training and opportunities so that people would actually stand a chance of becoming skilled to the point where they would be of some value, where they could in fact make a contribution to industry and so that job opportunities might be created along with economic growth in this country. But you have said nothing!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, `Well, work for the dole; the people want it'. Of course the people want it. There is nothing wrong with the concept of people making a contribution because the taxpayers of this country will benefit. There is nothing wrong with it as a concept. But do not come around here trying to paint it as some grand plan or as some panacea for the problems of unemployment in this country, because it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, as has been said repeatedly, you have not come up with one line that explains to people what you intend to do. You have been trying to milk this for the populist tokenism that it really is. You will get support if and when you put your plan on the table so that it can be assessed for what it is, but do not expect us to come along and put our hands up in support of something which, quite frankly, is nothing but a facade. It will have no benefit whatsoever unless you put the plan on the table. If you do not, then you cannot expect any support at all from us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point in time I do not think you have a plan. This looks to me very much like another Austudy cock&hyphen;up. That is exactly where it is headed. The Prime Minister thinks that it is fine to send young people out to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1825"> work on the reconstruction of old buildings or to pick up papers or to make a bit of a contribution. On the one hand that is fine, it is a community contribution, but it is not a solution that will get young people or any other people who are unemployed a proper job so they can make a long&hyphen;term contribution to this country.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1826"> serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator Abetz</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1832"> Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee that it should be so referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was first raised on 9 November 1995 with the then President of the Senate, the Hon. Michael Beahan, by Mr Geoffrey Marr, who claimed that false statements had been made by a Telstra officer to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee in the course of its estimates hearings of 27 June 1995. On 13 November 1995, a similar complaint was made by Mr Paul Miles, a friend and supporter of Mr Marr. The former President referred both letters to the ERCA committee on 13 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of the complaints may be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, at the ERCA committee hearings:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the reasons detailed in the report, the committee has concluded that no contempt of the Senate has been committed in respect of the matter referred to it. It has, however, made some observations about the difficulties experienced with evidence given by Telstra over a considerable period. In this regard, the committee has drawn attention to a resolution of the Senate of 21 October 1993 concerning the duty of all officers at senior levels of the public service and other agencies to understand the principles governing the operation of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also taken the opportunity to seek from the Senate a re-endorsement of the following long established principle in respect of statutory authorities:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">That whilst it may be argued that Statutory Authorities are not accountable through the

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill proposes amendments to overcome an anomaly in the Corporations Law which came to light in a court decision last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced in June 1993, provides a regime for companies to enter a scheme known as voluntary administration. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors, which enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing a better return for creditors than would be available if the company was wound up immediately. Using this method can, ideally, result in saving the business of the company and the jobs of employees. The mechanism may also serve to avoid costs and delays often associated with formal liquidations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The voluntary administration scheme is increasingly being used in substitution to other means of dealing with corporate insolvencies because of its stream 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1833"> lined procedures and minimal court involvement. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangement with their creditors in an effort to save the company or, at least, its business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there are cases where, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it becomes clear that the company cannot trade out of its difficulties. In such a case, the Corporations Law provides for an automatic transition to a liquidation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June last year, His Honour Mr Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 874; (1995) 17 ACSR 295 that where persons deal with a company under a deed of company arrangement (as opposed to dealing with the deed administrator), and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in the winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. His Honour stated that this was not a result that could have been intended by the legislature and therefore called for legislative amendment. Industry bodies, the legal and insolvency profession, and commentators have supported the call for amendment as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October last year, the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced by the previous government. The 1995 bill was designed to overcome the anomaly uncovered in the Crawford House decision. However, the 1995 bill failed to be passed before parliament rose prior to the March election and, accordingly, it has lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the 1995 bill was introduced, the coalition (then in Opposition) had some reservations about the form of the bill. In particular, the coalition had concerns about whether debts incurred while a company is under a deed of company arrangement should not only be provable but should also receive priority over other unsecured debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year the government consulted with key industry participants about the best means of overcoming the anomaly uncovered by the Crawford House decision. During the consultation process, the government was advised that a large number of insolvency practitioners have been acting on the assumption that the 1995 bill would become law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In those circumstances, the government considers that, in the interests of certainty and stability, the most desirable course is to retain the bill in the form it was originally introduced last year. To modify the bill in order to give certain debts priority could potentially give rise to some very difficult situations if liquidators have conducted administrations relying on the form of the 1995 bill. The most important thing at this stage is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure the debts are provable so creditors are not left high and dry and to prevent the voluntary administration scheme being compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the question of the priority which should be accorded to debts incurred by a company under a deed of company arrangement remains an important issue, the government will refer the question of priority for consideration by the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee which is currently undertaking a wide&hyphen;ranging review of the voluntary administration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners' Association of Australia have expressed their support for this course of action in light of the time that has passed since the lapsed 1995 bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My department has been developing Airports (Environmental Protection) Regulations (the EP regulations) in consultation with Environment Australia. This process has highlighted a number of areas where improvements can be made to the regime originally envisaged in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these recently tabled regulations, the environment strategy is the centrepiece of a performance-based regulatory regime under which each and every person carrying out an activity on an airport is responsible for the environmental impacts associated with their activity</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the current section 130 requires that an airport-lessee company take all reasonable steps to comply with any final airport environment strategy, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it does not require that other persons carrying out activities on an airport site do so. An amendment is proposed to allow for regulations to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EP regulations will establish a regime to identify and `manage' any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites. Soil pollution is a serious hazard, and there will be provision for remediation of pre-existing pollution, as well as for soil pollution that occurs after the regulations come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process is enshrined in the EP regulations but cannot be applied to pre&hyphen;existing contamination due to the acts Interpretation Act 1901 restriction on regulations with retrospective effect. To overcome this limitation, a proposed amendment will enable the Airport Environment Officer to require remediation of sites identified as polluted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In drafting the EP regulations, we have been constrained in the penalties that can be used for breaches of certain regulations. The amendment proposed to section 132 will enable appropriate variable penalties to be set in these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the EP regulations avoid a strict liability approach, we want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. Given the seriousness of these offences, they should be addressed in the act rather than regulations. Having surveyed state environmental legislation, drawing particularly on the South Australian and Queensland regimes, we believe a tiered approach to environmental harm is the best approach. The proposed amendments set out offences in the act to deal with persons intentionally or recklessly causing:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1996, the government took a major step towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market in Australia with the release of updated charter guidelines.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in statutory rules 1996 No. 338 and made under the Export Control Act 1982, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a nutshell, what the government is trying to do here is to remove the requirement that the export of whole logs, unprocessed wood, out of Australia be no longer licensed. The government is washing its hands of any responsibility for what happens to our forest resource in this country, beginning with this move on plantations, both softwood and hardwood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first states which will be affected are Tasmania and Victoria because they have a form of forest practice code which the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) will judge is environmentally satisfactory. Other states will follow, and a little further down the line all native forests that are not protected are going to be open to export by the major players in this industry, which is targeting the Australian public's great forests, and no licensing will be required any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had more forests and the industry was cutting less when it did not have the technological fire power which it has now to smash 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1836"> down our forests, put them on to log trucks, take them to the nearest port and send the logs away unprocessed. Jobs were exported and profits were exported with sending the logs to the Northern Hemisphere to be processed downstream. Jobs were created there. Of course, after they go through the pulp and paper industry, they end up on the rubbish dumps of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and Malaysia, or wherever it may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are seeing a suite of these regulations come through as the Howard government, the most environmentally irresponsible government certainly at this end of the century, divests itself of its responsibilities as far as the Australian forest environment is concerned. We know that 80 per cent of Australians want the machinery out of our native forests. We also know that we are in a period where hundreds of millions of dollars spent on the creation of plantations in this country in the 1960s and 1970s&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;are now bearing fruit. We now have a tidal wave of plantations available for processing. There is no need to be cutting our native forests because we have this enormous repository of plantations which are there because the public paid for them back in the 1960s and 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the ideal opportunity to save our native forests by moving across to plantation investment and to create jobs by having an industry management plan in this country which sees that those plantations are processed here. What have we got instead? In this set of regulations, another component of the move to have those trees simply put on ships and sent overseas. What we have is a process for turning Australia's forest into a giant wood mine. It is `quarry Australia'; it is `transport our forests out of this country'. Never mind the jobs, the downstream processing, the profits, the rural centres which are dependent upon and which could get some benefit&mdash;jobs and money&mdash;from the downstream processing; and even never mind those good minded people in the industry who have up to $1 billion worth of investment in downstream processing, given the right conditions, in this plantation resource that we have in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is going to win out of this? First of all, the big plantation companies who have a mining mentality: the quickest dollar possible. I cannot avoid the opportunity of saying that every time there is an environmental question to do with our forests in our country these big operators bring out their front organisations&mdash;like the Forest Protection Society which gets hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, as a front organisation, paid for out of the cutting down of forests in Australia by these big corporations&mdash;to cry crocodile tears about the loss of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have this government&mdash;and I understand it is going to be supported by the Labor Party&mdash;endorsing this process of having the trees cut down and shipped out of the district to the nearest port and sent to Japan and Taiwan, and with them the jobs. It is a sham: this whole industry pretence that it is concerned about jobs when, in fact, it is concerned about making a dollar as fast as possible&mdash;never mind the jobs&mdash;and is hell bent on so&hyphen;called streamlining and downsizing and re&hyphen;equipping at the expense of workers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are already export licences for 830,000 square metres of plantation logs out of this country&mdash;50 per cent from Tasmania. That 440,000 square metres of logs to be exported out of Tasmania could be made into building materials within this country. Taking them from the plantations to the ports is going to create 40 jobs. If this government and this opposition were really concerned about jobs they would have an  industry management plan which ensured that those same trees were processed in this country. Just that Tasmanian allocation could create 1,880 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have over 1700 jobs being exported out of the country because the industry is able to tweak the ear of the big parties and say, `We don't want licensing; we don't want any controls; we'll work under the forest practices code of Tasmania or Victoria or Western Australia or wherever it may be because we've been able to see that that suits our convenience. We want to make a quick dollar; we want to exploit the hundreds of millions of dollars invested by the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1837"> public in plantations; and we want to make that dollar as fast as possible&mdash;never mind the jobs.' That is the reality. And never mind the environment because the native forests are next in line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say two things about this. This industry is hell bent on logging national estate forests. We are currently seeing that in East Gippsland where it has been given the imprimatur of Mr Howard and Premier Kennett. We are shortly about to see it in Tasmania and Western Australia. In Tasmania the areas include world heritage value forests in the Picton, Huon and Weld valleys, in the area of Wild Crag, in the Great Western Tiers and in the Tarkine where, amongst other things, rainforests are targeted. Part of the proposal inherent in these regulations is the flattening of ancient rainforests&mdash;sure they call them degraded forest&mdash;to make way for eucalypt plantations for a quick dollar further down the line. With the destruction of those forests, including those rainforests, is the destruction of the wildlife and the ecosystems, the intactness of which go back to time immemorial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have camped out in them. At night you hear the calls of a number of different owls. You see the bats, which in Tasmania live only in the forests. You see the other bird species&mdash;like the white goshawk, which is down to 200 breeding pairs. The great wedge&hyphen;tailed eagles of Tasmania, which are bigger than their mainland cousins, are also down to 200 breeding pairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those birds nest in the north-east facing corner of these giant trees because they know that, in the early spring and late winter, that is the best place for them to be to get the early morning sunlight on their chicks so they can be raised to be the next generation. They are a generation which faces no trees at all in many of these areas. Plantations will be devoid of the original wildlife and will have no ability to provide the necessary security and vastness for the great nesting operations those eagles require for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have plantations available in this country so that the whole of our forest products industry can not only continue as required but expand. Because of those plantations, which we as taxpayers invested in 20 years ago, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have at this critical period the ability to achieve a win&hyphen;win situation&mdash;to provide our forest products, to increase jobs with downstream productions and to protect our great wild forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is part of a suite of measures coming through here which cuts the legs out from under that. It is so short&hyphen;sighted&mdash;whether you look at the environment, whether you look at the profitability, whether you look at the downstream products being available on the Australian market and for export or whether you look at jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an absurd situation for us to be fostering. What a crazy situation. We have such a glut of plantations at the moment. We have 24 million cubic metres of mature sawlogs, which is six times the annual native forest sawlog cut. The plantation sawlog supply will double over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a beautiful situation to fix this enormous controversy that has been going on for three decades in this country because the majority of Australians do not want our great wild forests destroyed and plundered by the woodchippers and the loggers when other resources are available. For the first time, it is unarguable that an alternative resource is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what this regulation is going to do? The regulation is going to divest the minister of any responsibility to give us that win&hyphen;win situation. It is going to have those plantations shipped out of the country and processed somewhere else. What an absurd and irresponsible situation. No wonder the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, is not here. There is no way he can answer the charge of irresponsibly handling our forest resource, our environment and our potential for job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party doing supporting this sort of regulation? What are they doing for job creation in the industry? What are they doing giving control over to the boffins of the big logging corporations? We know those corporations are irresponsible when it comes to the environment, and we know they are not interested in creating jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1838">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those corporations have shed 20,000 jobs in the last 25 years or so since the export woodchipping industry arrived in this country. That is 20,000 jobs lost, although native trees in this country are being cut down faster than ever before in history. What a scandalous situation it is. No wonder Robert Hill, the honourable minister, is not in this place to respond to this derelict set of regulations which is being brought before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal to the opposition to think again before they go over there and support the government in allowing these regulations through. I cannot think that any responsible look at the potential for job growth in rural areas and in downstream processing around this country can be treated in such a cavalier fashion&mdash;if you really do mean you want to create jobs in this industry, if you really do mean you want to get a win&hyphen;win situation and if you really do mean you want those people who would invest in downstream processing in this country to get some assistance to do so, rather than having the rug pulled out from under them by an export industry which does nothing for this country but turn our forest resource into a quarry and turn our forest resource into a bonanza for job creation and money making everywhere else in the world but in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a challenge very often put to the Greens. I say keep those forests here. I say give assistance to this industry to downstream process here. I say take away the assistance to those people who want to simply export our forests out of this country. I say if you cannot do that you are hypocrites. I say this is a derelict and irresponsible policy as far as our forests are concerned. I say this is a watershed opportunity for the government and the opposition to get back on line as far as their joint responsibility to the environment and the workers in the forest industry in this country is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in the wake of my speaking here members of past governments as well as the present one are going to come out with the claptrap fed to them by the industry and that emanates from these big logging corporations. That would be their only defence. But I ask you to tell me how you can give a tick 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the export of millions of tons of our plantations in the coming years at the expense of our native forests, our downstream processing and our job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind those senators who are interested in this debate or who will be voting on these regulations that the companies which grow plantations in this country include North, Wesfarmers, Boral, Amcor, Fletcher Challenge, News Corporation&mdash;which, of course, owns ANM&mdash;CSR and Auspine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the government, I indicate that we shall not be supporting this motion of disallowance. It would be a ludicrous proposition to do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was listening to Senator Brown's contribution to the debate and wondering what he was going to bring before the Senate, he having waited 13 sitting days to bring this motion on. If Senator Brown thought this issue was so important, he could have brought it on at any time in the preceding 12 sitting days, but he waited until today. Senator Brown got himself so worked up that I thought he was going to take off like one of those birds he was referring to, but it would have been a flight of fancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that this debate is about the relaxation of export controls on unprocessed timber from plantations&mdash;not from the great wild forests that we have heard about for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1839"> last 20 minutes. That was one of the most irrelevant contributions I have heard. This is about plantation forests that were planted 20 years ago.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you interjected, Senator Margetts, because about three or four years ago I was considering buying 200 acres of former forestry country in North Queensland, on the Atherton Tableland, which had been cleared and was being used for dairy and really should not have been because it was too hilly. I was going to buy 200 acres of that land and plant it to plantation. Honourable senators may want to know why I did not do so. I did not do so because there was no guarantee that, 20 years down the track, I was going to be able to get the timber off. This goes right to the heart of the issue. I did not have the confidence to put up my good money and to borrow money to invest it in the timber industry if, when the trees matured, somebody was going to hop up here and claim that this is all about some multi&hyphen;national company wanting to smash down the great wild forests. We are talking about plantation timber here, about giving an incentive to plant more plantation timber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We always hear the Greens say that they want to have more plantation timber. I agree, but people are only going to plant plantation timber, as Senator Murphy would know, if they can get a price for it and make a profit out of the exercise. Of course, if you deny people access to the international market, if you deny Australian plantations access to the best prices, then nobody is going to have an incentive to plant here in the future. That is why the former government, to its credit, was willing to relax export controls on unprocessed logs from plantation stocks, not from ancient forests, not from areas that have never been felled before, not from rainforests, not from any of the things to which Senator Brown referred for most of his contribution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about unprocessed logs from plantations, areas which were deliberately planted so that they could be harvested. It is not unreasonable in the circumstances to say that, when they are harvested, given that people made the investment, given that these trees have grown and made a contribution to the environment and, when replanted, will do so again, they should have a right to a decent return for their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the novel argument developed by Senator Brown that somehow we should not harvest this plantation timber and send it overseas, that instead we should use it as a substitute for native forest timbers. Of course, any honourable senator in this chamber who has any knowledge at all of the timber industry will know that most of the plantation timber in this country is softwood&mdash;it is not hardwood&mdash;and that most of the native timbers that are taken out are hardwood and not softwood. So softwood is not going to be a substitute for hardwood products.</PARA>

It is also obvious that the Greens refuse to extend to other people the courtesy that was just extended to them, that is, the courtesy of being heard in silence. Senator Brown's argument, of course, is that somehow we should just pretend that we can substitute the softwood plantations for hardwood resources and, moreover, that somehow it is going to grow the timber industry&mdash;and I see that is receiving some mirth on the other side of the chamber, as well it deserves to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, we would lose some $2 billion of exports from the timber industry each year. Two billion is not a lot of money to the Greens because they never have to find it, but $2 billion is a major loss to export earnings in this country, as the former minister sitting opposite would know. That loss would be a direct consequence of the suggestions made by Senator Brown today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1840">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anybody believes that this country, with its high level of debt and its high balance of payments deficit, would want to lose $2 billion of exports, they must have holes in their head, but, quite clearly, that is the viewpoint of those on the other side. That would be $1.5 billion a month and that works out to about $50 million a day in lost export earnings. I want it on the record that that is the viewpoint of the Greens. They would like to lose $50 million a day of hard currency exports that this country so desperately needs. That would be the consequence of their policy and they should be condemned for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be utterly counterproductive to the development of a forest industry in this country were we now to challenge the very nature of the security which the plantation timber industry so desperately seeks. I speak as one who has been deterred from investing in plantation timber for just the sort of performance that we have seen today. Quite frankly, I am very glad to say that I understand that the opposition will be supporting us. We are basically applying a policy that the previous government in their wisdom brought forward. It received our support then and I understand that they are going to support us in supporting it now and I thank them for so doing.</PARA></SPEECH>

Come in spinner it was well and truly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now listen to Senator Brown weep crocodile tears for workers. That is always a convenient glib argument with people of Senator Brown's ilk. They never mean it. Those commitments absolutely drip with insincerity. Because the cold hard facts are that Senator Brown would be perfectly happy to see not a solitary person working in the forestry industry in Australia. That is his true agenda. To have the sanctimonious clothing of what Senator Brown really wants clothed with concern for the workers is a bit too much for me, I have to say. It is crocodile tears indeed. It is false. It is insincere. You do not actually believe a word of it. You would have every single worker in the forest industry in Australia out of a job tomorrow if you could achieve it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that we are still significantly short of plantation resource in Australia. We have demonstrably a massive annual deficit, which is in fact increasing not decreasing, in forest products into Australia. We need to expand our plantation resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the matters I pursued during discussions on forestry was why there was such a dramatic increase in plantation resource in New Zealand and there was not in a Australia. I questioned the companies that were involved in expanding the plantation resource in New Zealand why they were not putting similar investments into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear Senator O'Chee's personal involvement as a potential small investor in plantations. Senator O'Chee may be interested to know that one of the consistent causes of that lack of investment quoted was export controls over the resource. It is unlike wheat, oats, corn or any other agricultural product that would have come off that same land and was not subject to any controls at all. In other words, people were out in the marketplace getting a price for the product and that was all they had to cope with rather than the whim&mdash;and let me tell you it is a dreadful incentive for investors&mdash;and fate that their investment is in the hands of a parliament, irrespective of whatever government in power. It is a total unknown, particularly when&mdash;and let us be precise about this&mdash;it is in the hands of the Senate rather than the parliament. It is a huge disincentive for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am taking full responsibility for this. So I determined to persuade cabinet at the time to remove this disincentive to plantations in Australia to encourage further investment in plantations in Australia providing it was done with the best possible environmental codes of practice supervised, I might add, by CSIRO.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. He does not trust anybody.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grown timber, not native timber with the wedge&hyphen;tailed eagles in it, which I am as concerned about as you, Senator Brown. I am once again offended by the fact that you think you have an individual licence on concern for the environment that is possessed by no-one else. As someone who actually worked for the CSIRO division of wildlife research and worked for eight years as a wildlife researcher in what is now known as Kakadu National Park, I am constantly resentful of this mandate that Senator Brown thinks he personally possesses and which he thinks no-one else in Australia does about concern for the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Senator Brown's argument fell down from the first piece of nonsense that he uttered in this debate&mdash;and nonsense it was. He said that Australia currently has a plantation resource as a result of investment over the last 20 years that is capable now of redressing our balance of payments deficit in respect of timber industry products. That is utter nonsense. We do need to continue to expand plantations to save the native forests that Senator Brown purportedly is so concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the regulations before the Senate, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy may lift these export controls only where state plantation codes of practice are found to satisfactorily protect environmental and heritage values in that state. Those codes have to be scientifically assessed by the CSIRO. I will declare my interest as a former employee of CSIRO. It is an organisation in which I do have a considerable amount of trust, an organisation which I think is very credible. That was our position in government, so we are certainly going to support that position in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1995, the then government announced its wood and paper industry strategy backed by a four&hyphen;year funding package of $38 million. That strategy was complemented by funding for structural adjustment assistance. The key initiatives within that strategy included encouraging innovation, value adding and downstream processing; removing impediments to investment; improving international competitiveness; opening 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1842"> export opportunities and improving the skill base of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January last year, the then government established a council to drive that strategy. It was our belief that its success would depend on the commitment of the industry, so we put the industry in charge. The council was provided with $3.5 million over four years so the council had the resources, the expertise, the time and the commitment to do that job. It was a high powered council by anyone's measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its membership included senior executives from industry, senior union officials and state and local government representatives. It is worth just mentioning a few names in terms of what the government subsequently did to it: Kathryn Adams, the Executive Director of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation; Ron Adams, a Director of Wesfarmers Bunnings; Christopher Brookes, the Chief Executive of Tasmania Development and Resources; Trevor Smith&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear the cackles and the laughter from the Democrats and the Greens, which just proves my case. Why are they laughing and cackling? Because I am actually mentioning senior industry figures. That is right, these are industry figures involved in investment in plantations, so obviously they must be the criminal. They must be the devil with two horns and a forked tail because they happen to be executives of companies that are investing in plantations. It is amazing, indeed, what turns the Greens on in these debates, and proof positive of the point I just made that the true agenda of the Greens has nothing whatsoever to do with jobs in Australia's timber industry&mdash;quite the reverse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that the people most relevant to advancing a plantation timber industry in Australia were on that council, despite, as I say, the derisory laughter from down at the other end of this chamber. So what did the new government do when they came to office? I will tell you what they did before they came to office. During the election campaign, they produced a primary industry policy, a document which in fact adopted our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy as their own. I do not mind that; in fact I applauded it at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost the whole of the primary industry policy called Reviving the Heartland was simply a carbon copy of proposals which we had put into place in government. For those who may disbelieve me, let me quote directly from the coalition document. It says that a Liberal and National Party government will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . implement the $38 million wood and paper industry strategy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, ours&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the $107 million forest industry structural adjustment package.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, during the election campaign they committed themselves to adopt the same strategy that we had in government and the same funding. What did the government do when it came to office? You guessed it. It cut the funding and abolished the council&mdash;two things they had committed themselves in writing to keep when they were campaigning. In a letter to members of the council, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has made a commitment to expedite the implementation of the national forestry policy statement. The government has also endorsed the four-year wood and paper industry strategy as an important part of its forest policy objectives. Consultative arrangements are . . . currently the subject of a comprehensive review and it is anticipated that the new arrangements will soon be finalised. As part of this review, the Wood and Paper Industry Council has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That letter was dated September 1996. I have continued to monitor, and I will continue to monitor, the government's progress in this important area through the estimates hearings. After all, the industry does employ about 70,000 people, many of them in regional Australia. I have an interest in the jobs and the futures of those people, even if Senator Brown does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a serious trade deficit in timber that must be addressed, and we have an industry that is far too dependent on the housing sector and the economic cycles it follows for its livelihood. I asked some questions at the last estimates hearing only a couple of weeks ago and got some profoundly unsatisfactory, and indeed amazing, answers. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1843"> I asked how the Wood and Paper Industry Council was going and whether there had been any change to its membership. The answer I got at estimates was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are still considering a membership of that council and how it should be established.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is almost a year to the day that the government&mdash;or, more precisely, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer)&mdash;announced they were going to fix this, but they have not even been able to settle the membership of a council to oversight the downstream processing that we are all so very concerned about. At the beginning September last year, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) said that the matter would be settled soon. This important process has in fact gone backwards and not forwards since March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we are prepared to support the government in voting down this motion for disallowance, I will take this opportunity to remind those opposite that we do expect them to honour their commitment given in writing to the industry, the unions and the workers that are represented in that industry&mdash;70,000 of them&mdash;to implement the strategy in this key sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition gave a written commitment to do so and breached it almost immediately after they got into office. We will continue to work with these groups and we will continue to monitor the progress of the government through Senate estimates and all of the other forums that are available to us to ensure that in this instance the government promise is declared to be a core one and is implemented in full.</PARA></SPEECH>

If you look at the state by state breakdown of what people use&mdash;and housing is a good example&mdash;you will see that, where there is native timber available dirt cheap, that is what is used; whereas, in my home state of South Australia, where over 90 per cent of our timber comes out of the pine plantations, mostly down around Mount Gambier, people tend to go for the softwood timbers. And that is what the housing industry uses in bulk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who has built a house using native hardwood&mdash;because it was very cheap; it is built in the Croajingolong&mdash;and also a house in Adelaide that is of pine construction, a pole frame place, I can assure you which one I would prefer to hammer nails into.

Although we are heading down the road, we do not have as yet&mdash;although Tasmania, I understand, is working on it by felling their native forests and putting in hardwood plantations&mdash;enough chips to support our mills here. And I really would have thought that a government that comes in here and pretends to be worried about real jobs would have had some concerns about what this decision today is going to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been an interesting little debate thus far. But, while I would like to indicate&mdash;as I have indicated to Senator Brown&mdash;that we are unable to support his motion with regard to the disallowance, what I would also like to endeavour to do is to clarify what plantations are and some of the issues which relate to plantations. In the context of this debate, plantations should have been seen as both private and public. There are public plantations and there are private plantations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee, in making his contribution, pointed out that one of the problems was that export regulations deny access to the free market. Senator Bob Collins pointed out that we do not have export controls on wool or wheat. That is very true. But, for a long time, the way in which our export controls have been applied has been wrong. Many of my colleagues know that on many occasions I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have criticised&mdash;within the caucus of my own party&mdash;the approach we took to applications for and granting of woodchip licences. That was one of the most iniquitous processes you could ever have in front of you. But it has been continued by this current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to watch with great interest how this government grants some of the woodchip licences, which are not three&hyphen;year licences, when they come up for renewal this year. Because, if you go to Senator O'Chee's point, you should have open slather with regard to all people in the private sector. In my view, all privately owned wood should have open access to the free market. That will not work, but that is what the case should be. Everybody should be treated equally; there should be no differentiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me back to the point about the two types of plantations which I have a view about. In so far as the public forest resource of this country is concerned, I have a totally different view. As far as that resource is concerned, whether it be in the form of plantation or in the form of its current native forest status, there should be&mdash;and continue to be&mdash;export controls in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate circumstance is that in this country there are so few players in our forest industry. By all accounts&mdash;and it is true&mdash;as a supplier of forest products we are but a very small player on the world scene. Senator Collins pointed out, very accurately, with regard to the importation of forest products, that we have a huge and growing trade deficit. Yet we do not see many steps being taken by the existing industry players&mdash;particularly the big industry players&mdash;to go to downstream processing and value adding in this country. That is what I want to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown, you have an audience to play to and you have taken a course of action to appeal to them. I have been involved in the forest debate for a long time. I have been involved with nearly every major inquiry that has happened in the forest industry, and I have seen few changes. Even today nothing has really changed. I will read a couple of things from the National Forest Policy Statement, which the government committed itself to&mdash;as we did when in government; in fact, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1846"> we were the creators of it. On page 16 of that statement in the clause on efficient use and value adding, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to attract new investment and profitable value&hyphen;adding projects, the Governments must establish clear and consistent policies for resource development, providing secure access to resources and consistent environmental guidelines. Unnecessary impediments to market efficiency and access will be removed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins said yes, and I agree with that. The unfortunate thing, Senator, is that we failed a bit when we had the reins, and the government of today has continued not to address any of those questions. It was pointed out to the government that they have scrapped the industry development council. History has told us that the forest industry itself is not capable of coming to grips with how it might go on and develop. When I was the Secretary of the Australian Timber Workers Union, in negotiations with North Broken Hill when they sold the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills at Burnie they said that they were a resource based company and only had an interest in supplying resources to someone else to manufacture. Yet they continued to be granted the majority of export licences for woodchips out of this country. That in itself is a travesty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the guidelines in the regulations that currently stand&mdash;albeit significantly weakened from the ones that we put in place&mdash;even those guidelines do have a little bit about value adding. But it is only a little bit because value adding is mentioned in just one sub point under part 8  `consideration of application for transitional licence'. Part 8 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before deciding whether to grant a transitional licence, the Minister may consider:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and then (c):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the desirability of encouraging investment in value&hyphen;added production in forest industries and related industries . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we are committed to employment generation in a resource based industry that probably has a greater capacity than most other resource based industries to create jobs in regio 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nal Australia, then we ought to be doing something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Collins said, we are going to monitor this government; we are going to continue to review the course of action that you have taken. From my point of view, I put you on notice to this extent: at the end of the day we will do whatever we have to do to bring about a proper approach to industry development in this resource based industry, because if we do not do that we will end up with a position where we will see wholesale shipping out of the forest based resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not have any truck with that as far as private plantation wood is concerned. I think it is the right of the private forest owner and the private forest grower to have access to the marketplace, whether it be an international marketplace or a domestic marketplace. But I do believe, as I said earlier, that our crown forests belong to the country and they should be used as the basis for developing an industry within this country. There is a responsibility on all governments. All of the governments have signed up to&mdash;and eventually Tasmania did&mdash;the national forest policy statement, and the intentions and objectives of that statement gave a commitment to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to a paper put out by the Forests and Forest Industry Council of Tasmania entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Secure Futures for Forests and People</EMPHASIS>, which is a blueprint for the future of the Tasmanian forest industry. As a member of the executive of that council, I often go back and read the mission statement which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To responsibly and sensibly manage Tasmania's forests in a way that:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, boy did we fail, because there has been nothing but a continued decline in the jobs in the forest industries in Tasmania. One of the primary reasons that has happened is that the state government&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1847"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly right, Senator Collins, because at the end of the day it is state governments that have the principal responsibility for the management and operations of the forest industry. The Commonwealth has a capacity only in so far as export controls are concerned and, in many instances, we have overlooked the way in which those controls ought to have been used. This Tasmanian forest industry strategy document goes to the question of people issues. Principle 1 under the heading `people issues' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forests and forest industry strategy must produce an outcome which protects and seeks to enhance jobs of Tasmanians who currently work in the forest or who are dependent on the forest products industry for their livelihood.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, it is sad in that we have failed dismally. The course of action that this government has taken with regard to the scrapping of the industry council is just another example of the steps that have been taken by conservative governments to sell off the farm&mdash;to allow it to be chopped down and sold off at the earliest opportunity. You need to involve parties that represent workers in the industry to enhance job creation. At present you could go to any number of work sites around this country that are working in the forest based industry and ask them if they think that their industry is heading in the right direction in so far as job creation is concerned, and they will all tell you, `No, it is not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many international reports produced on this industry over time which tell us that, within our own region of the world, there is a shortfall in terms of supply over demand of timber products. We know that for a fact. We know that, even if we cut down every tree and every plantation and indeed every native forest that is accessible, we still would not even be able to meet a small percentage of the requirement for timber products in our area of the world&mdash;that is, within the Asia-Pacific region. On the basis of our having that knowledge, if we cannot proceed to take steps to ensure that we get an industry that serves to better utilise the resource that is in the forests&mdash;whether it be plantation or not&mdash;then there is a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of example, I can remember&mdash;and Senator Collins will remember this very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearly as the principal minister responsible&mdash;when we used to deal with woodchip licences on an annual basis. We put in a requirement&mdash;I think it was in 1994-95&mdash;for a greater commitment to value adding. Even prior to that, we always placed some emphasis on a commitment to value adding. Of course, the companies used to trot up every year. They would have a feasibility study for an MDF plant or a pulp mill or a particle board mill. It was a feasibility study into a feasibility study but nothing ever happened. I have raised these issues before in this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we debated another regulation that related to export woodchip licences, I noted that Senator Harradine said that he would also be watching how we proceeded, to ensure that jobs were created in this industry. I hope that he will take note of the circumstances that are occurring in this country's forest industries today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I keep referring to Tasmania because I know the Tasmanian forest industry better than the industry in most other states. But I can give an example in Victoria where Harris&hyphen;Daishowa actually refused to take residue woodchips from Andrews Sawmill. Andrews Sawmill is a sawmill we initially helped set up. We ensured that the residue from their operation, which was cutting very low&hyphen;grade logs, would be sold at a fair price and exported as woodchips. This year, after the issuing of the licences, Harris&hyphen;Daishowa said that it would not take the residue from Andrews. It did so on the basis that they said that the residue was not saw log residue. Technically, they were right because the logs that Andrews were cutting were not classified as saw logs. They were a lower grade than any classification the Victorian forestry had for saw log classifications or specifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to one proponent in Tasmania who was wanting to build a recovery sawmill and was seeking to purchase resource from the forestry for another sawmill on the north&hyphen;west coast. In my view the Forestry Commission of Tasmania, because of the pressures it had upon it from major industry players, refused&mdash;not directly, but indirectly; this was the net effect&mdash;to sell the wood to this person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1848"> to run that operation, which would have created around 100 jobs. They stood up in a court case and said&mdash;which I find amazing&mdash;that they only had an obligation to find 300,000 cubic metres of saw logs. That was a statutory obligation. They did not have any obligation to go out and look for some additional saw logs to supply to other proponents. They did not have any obligation to set specifications for what they call category 8 saw logs&mdash;no obligation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Forestry Commission of Tasmania: you do have an obligation. You have an obligation to ensure that we better this industry and that we create more jobs in it, because it can create many thousands more jobs. It has a huge potential. But it will have no potential if it is not guided in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, we did things with the car industry and the steel industry, because they needed that guidance. We need to do it with the forest industry. It is unfortunate that we had to come in here to debate a motion&mdash;and I say this with no disrespect to Senator Brown&mdash;put up by Senator Brown essentially for another purpose. I also agree with Senator Bob Collins in that I do not believe that Senator Brown necessarily has too much concern about how many people are working in the industry. I guess that is fine. That is a position he has taken. But I certainly do have a concern, as I said earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put the government on notice that, with my colleagues, I will pursue the government to ensure that you do put in place the industry council that you gave a commitment to and, when you have put that council in place, that it is representative of the people in the industry. That includes the workers of the industry. I have seen many councils called industry councils come and go. They have essentially failed. I will also, along with my colleagues, pursue the government to ensure that, whatever that industry council recommends in terms of industry strategy, it will be taken notice of. It will not be a straw man exercise. We will pursue the government and continue to review your position. As I said, we will take whatever course of action is necessary to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bring about a change if that is what is required.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an interesting debate today; and it is a debate that needs to be had. I do find it disturbing that it seems that any sort of call for some sort of industry policy is greeted by both sides of the chamber as if it is a dirty word. An industry policy that looks at ecological sustainability and employment and outcomes should not be a dirty word. We seem to have changed so quickly in such a short time that the assumption is that whatever the larger and often internationally controlled corporations want is necessarily best for the industry, best for Australia and best for employment. I do not think the proof is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally have had a deep&hyphen;seated interest in the issues of employment and ecologically sustainable development. At the time I was elected, I was working on a research master's degree in economics on that very topic. That interest has continued. I was working on a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis in terms of real total outcomes with the community on resource development projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I have had a very specific interest over time in relation to the sustainable timber industry in Western Australia and, in particular, the potential for agroforestry. A lot of the debate has been about plantation, but it is also about moving to a whole range of structures in the future which will allow a win&hyphen;win situation. I can back up this interest because under the internship program in 1996 we commissioned a student, Sophie Clayton, who produced a very good report&mdash;I will be tabling it at a later date and referring to it in some detail&mdash;which dealt with agroforestry as a component of the timber industry in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of issues and arguments thrown around today, but there are certainly differences of opinion about whether or not the current plantation and agroforestry resources in Australia are sufficient to cover the sawn timber needs of Australia. Judy Clark, in 1995, produced a report called `Australia's plantations: industry, employment and environment' for Environment Victoria in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1849"> Melbourne. It is true to say there have been papers and criticism of Judy Clark's figures. Judy has got a lot of credibility on the issue, but it is true that the National Association of Forest Industries produced a report in 1995 refuting some of her statements. Judy, herself, has answered a lot of its criticisms in another report in 1996. What we can be sure of is that there is a debate about the current plantation resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those who believe they have the figures to show that the current plantation resources in Australia are sufficient to cover the sawn timber needs of Australia at the moment. Senator Lees mentioned the situation in the housing industry in South Australia. Across Australia the irony is that the vast majority of timber used in the housing industry is actually imported timber. Several speakers today have certainly mentioned that we have an annual trade deficit in forest products. It is true and it is around $2 billion a year. The total volume of timber in states like Western Australia is similar. But, in fact, the value adding and the difference in the costs means that we have a distinct deficit, and that is the same right around Australia. There is a total deficit of around $2 billion annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has heard from Senator Murphy in the past that he is concerned about the issue of value adding, and so am I. I really do think that in Western Australia some of the issues become very interesting in relation to this proposal to deregister regulations for the export of plantation wood, because Western Australia has been given a proposal for a mega pulp mill. This grew by 40 per cent even from the time it was drafted until the time it was presented to the Greens (WA), trying to get up to world scale. I hate to think what it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that pulp mills do not have to be at world scale, because the most important thing for any kind of value adding, such as paper manufacturing, is that you actually use your mill at full capacity. If you build a pulp mill at a scale at which you have no likelihood of continuing to be able to operate it at full capacity, you are not going to be operating efficiently, so I believe it is more effec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive to build your pulp mill at a scale that is realistic. Even boutique style pulp mills for different sorts of products might be useful at times, so long as you have your market organised, you have a little bit of flexibility and you can build in the options. I believe there is a potential to build in the options for farm forestry and agroforestry as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the proposal in Western Australia, I think it was something like 250,000 cubic metres mooted originally. Now at that level in Western Australia we would have had enough, I believe, plantation timbers available to just meet that, providing they kept being replanted. But by the time the scale even reached 400,000 cubic metres, if my figures are correct, we were way beyond the point where they were even planning to meet the capacities of what existed in Western Australia. That meant that they were planning a pulp mill that would continue to be an old&hyphen;growth forest munching monster&mdash;there is no way around it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you add the fact of the removal of export controls on unprocessed wood&mdash;low value plantation wood&mdash;that means that if that proposal does happen in Western Australia, there is no way around it. Those people who will find a potential quick market for their plantation wood now will have that withdrawn from availability by the time the pulp mill comes into action, if it does come into action. I certainly hope the pulp mill that they are proposing does not. I would like to see appropriately scaled pulp mills that are, indeed, ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been comments made today about the reasons why people are not investing in plantations, and I would like to give some other reasons as well. In Western Australia, Sophie Clayton went around to a large number of people. She talked to government representatives, farming representatives, pastoralists and graziers, foresters and forestry people. There are a couple of cultural impediments. They included the example that was given by the Department of Conservation and Land Management on this issue, which was not too special&mdash;their responsibility for education and extension on those issues&mdash;and also the lack of desire of many farmers to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1850"> enter into an arrangement in Western Australia with CALM or Bunnings. So in Western Australia there are deep cultural issues which actually came up as more important to those people who were surveyed as things which currently hold them back from taking the step of getting into plantations or agroforestry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are economic barriers, and they include lack of finance due to the high cost of establishing trees. There was a situation where there is a market in Western Australia for blue gums, but not enough planning in terms of other forms of tree planting as well. But there were legal issues as well. One of those was the ownership of land and trees, which was cited as one of the those issues in terms of the investment patterns offered to farmers. That came out of the farm forestry task force of 1995. But, as was mentioned today, there were other things cited as legal impediments, and one is the ability to harvest produce. The only impediment that was mentioned today as the main impediment&mdash;and those people who mentioned it surely must have known others&mdash;was that people wanted access to exports. The work that has been done in Western Australia indicated that people wanted access to the ability to harvest, which does not necessarily equate to access to exports. If there was an industry policy, either state or federal, then the value adding and the ability to value add to these timbers would mean that the best price would be actually gained by value adding within Australia, providing those goods which we are currently importing at very large cost to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are a lot of issues on employment that I have mentioned on many occasions but which people forget about, such as the fact that there are a lot more people employed in industries associated with live forests than there are with industries cutting them down. We risk a hell of a lot more jobs by cutting down old growth forests than we ever do from putting them through the chip mill. That is a fact; there are a lot more jobs at risk from losing the old growth forests to the chip mill than from the chipping industry or even at this stage from the sawn timber industry in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We never tend to think of those, perhaps because there are a lot more women and younger people involved with those jobs in small industry&mdash;provisions, tourism and transport; you name it&mdash;all throughout the areas where people like to go to the forest. Those jobs are important and they should not be considered as if they are not existing. They do exist and they are at threat when you threaten that resource. I think it is important that we see this as a whole issue. I would like to point out that amongst members of the Greens and the green supporters there are farmers and farm foresters. These issues have been of great importance and I believe they have a lot to add to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard debate has been difficult today because there have been some statements made. I think Senator O'Chee probably started it off with some statements which tended to deliberately misread the statements made today. There must be an understanding of the connection between what we are doing on industry policy, with plantations or agroforestry, and our old growth forests. It is unfortunate that there did not seem to be a knowledge of the link between those two. I really hope the knowledge and understanding of that increases in the future. I would like to see us moving towards a truly ecological policy in relation to industry, a policy that does look at jobs in general, the total jobs available, that looks at sustainable policies in the future and at job creation within the industry. That is what I have been working on for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward in the not too distant future to presenting and tabling in the Senate this report by Sophie Clayton and giving more details on the issues. In Western Australia it is a very important issue. I therefore indicate that I will be supporting Senator Brown's motion. I do believe we have to be looking at this issue as an industry policy and I do not think industry policy is something we in Australia should be ashamed of.</PARA></SPEECH>

But those decades have seen the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party capturing policies that have delivered those outcomes and at some time surely we have to question the value of their judgment in such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is about processing plantation timber in Australia&mdash;although Senator Margetts has properly made the link to old growth forests&mdash;and about raising the value of both the old growth and plantation timber industries. The careful, unradical&mdash;if that is a proper word&mdash;well&hyphen;researched and very capable Judy Clark, who is widely used, as senators would know, by the plantation companies as a consultant, has supported Senator Brown's disallowance motion in a letter that I received. I think that is quite an important point to make because it is one thing to point to Senator Brown and his constituency and his particular views; it is quite another when there is a wide ranging group which supports an alternative view on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this current government is going to be condemned by future generations for what may come to be described as environmental crimes. But ignore that emotive categorisation, because by their own standards there is an even worse possibility and that is that they are going to be condemned for their economic crimes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone who I would describe as a laissez&hyphen;faire free marketer on the government side told me some time ago that he was absolutely dismayed by government policy in the timber industry. He believed that the timber industry, from whatever perspective&mdash;his perspective, the free market perspective, the economic perspective, the environmental perspective&mdash;is being ripped off because our trees, our industries and our resources are totally undervalued. Not only are we destroying an invaluable finite resource&mdash;and all of us on this side of the cross&hyphen;party benches believe those trees are worth far more standing up in the old&hyphen;growth forests than being cut down&mdash;but all of us believe that the plantation industry is not getting the returns it should. That person on the government side told me that he thought we were selling our assets for a pittance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to this export disallowance motion, we say that the Commonwealth is moving to deregulate all areas of the timber industry and to remove itself from any role in environmental protection and regulation in the timber industry without substituting a carefully crafted industry policy.

These government regulations are part of that overall process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Western Australian senator, I must tell you that in our vast state we have approximately 87,000 hectares&mdash;I can never get my mind around cubic metres; I can get my mind around hectares&mdash;of pine or softwood plantations and approximately 60,000 hectares of blue gum hardwood plantations. We are indebted, in fact, to our conservative colleagues as the predecessors who established those plantation industries in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the pine plantations in WA, the soft wood plantations, are publicly owned and managed by CALM, the Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1852"> well-known organisation which is both exploiter and conserver and is continually ridden by the conflict of interest that therefore results. Most of the blue gum hardwood plantations, in contrast, are privately owned&mdash;by many of the companies which Senator Brown outlined earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those stocks of logs&mdash;and no&hyphen;one in the Senate has disagreed&mdash;are an extremely valuable resource. Our view is that they are undervalued&mdash;and drastically so. They are undervalued in terms of the following things. As public assets, most of the pine plantation estate was established using taxpayer funds. The plantations are not valued in the national accounts. One of the things I like about the New Zealand national accounts is that at least they value their natural resources, and that appears in the national balance sheet. We would like to see the same thing happen in the state balance sheet and the Commonwealth balance sheet. What is the value of our national natural resource?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the economic value, if the logs were sold off onto the global commodity market, they would earn a fraction of the value they would earn if they were processed into timber products in WA. In terms of job creation, I had the enlightening experience of asking the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr McGauran) about manufacturing jobs and he gave a non-answer; I got no answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already major investment in downstream processing of plantation wood in WA and there is great scope, as my Western Australian colleague Senator Margetts has said, for increased processing and job creation. Once again, returning to the very level-headed economist Judy Clark, her landmark study shows that in WA alone there could be a doubling of the existing 1,500 plantation processing jobs if existing stocks of plantation wood were processed domestically. That is a doubling of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the potential to substitute resources to allow old&hyphen;growth forests to be protected. As you know, I have a strong interest in the tourism and small business industry and I believe old&hyphen;growth forests need to be protect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed not only for their intrinsic value as a natural resource but in terms of tourism, and small business relations with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments and industry, in contrast, in our part of the world appear keen to see this plantation resource liquidated&mdash;with that kind of short&hyphen;term, commission&hyphen;taking mentality of theirs&mdash;so that it cannot be used as an alternative to the destruction of our remaining old&hyphen;growth forests. When they hear that there is a bottomless market out there which we can hardly fill, they see an opportunity to chop the forests down. We must resist those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The push to deregulate the export of logs from the plantations is, in my view, a short&hyphen;sighted, short&hyphen;term, exploitative and asset stripping manoeuvre by state governments who are short of money and by business corporations who want money. CALM and our short&hyphen;term commission takers in WA would probably be delighted if they could liquidate their pine stock as a short&hyphen;term fundraising opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have the view that, until such time as an industry policy is sketched out which preserves on a long-term sustainable basis the plantation processing industry and the old&hyphen;growth national park and tourism sector, we will not be satisfied with these kinds of regulations, which are simply based on an opportunity to exploit a finite resource.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.28 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the export disallowance motion. I would like to make some comments on some factors raised in the debate before this goes to a vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has come out of the debate is the irrefutable connection between our plantation resource in Australia and our native forest resource. Senator Bob Collins, in his speech, asked: how do the two go together? The continual reference to the work of forest economist Judy Clark has answered that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that her studies&mdash;which were done in close conjunction with the plantation industry around this country&mdash;discovered was that there are 24 million cubic metres of plantation forests available for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1853"> wood products industry in this country. That is equivalent to six years of the sawlog supply currently coming out of our native forests. On top of that, the plantation sawlog supply in Australia will double over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot put our heads in the sand on that, Senator Collins. The reality is that this is factual material. It is time that the woodchip industry in particular, and some of the big players who are part of the National Association of Forest Industries&mdash;some of the CEOs that you listed in your contribution, Senator Collins&mdash;no longer get away with the myth that there is no alternative to our native forests for supplying the Australian domestic requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been established that our plantation base can supply our domestic needs. What is required is the political will to achieve a win&hyphen;win situation by getting our domestic needs from that plantation availability at the same time as protecting our native forests from the big logging companies. The policies of successive governments are facilitating the wreaking of ongoing destruction by those companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy's words ring with a sad truth. He and I have been sparring partners in Tasmania in the past. Indeed, I can remember Senator Murphy, as a representative of the workers of the industry, blockading the Wilderness Society's head office at 130 Davies Street at the time of Farmhouse Creek, and the industry invasion of what is now a component of the world heritage forests of Tasmania. Senator Murphy was representing, as ever, the interests of the workers of the industry in Tasmania and targeting the environmentalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is a very honest man. Rarely does an honest man stand up in this Senate and say, `We failed'&mdash;that is, the Labor Party&mdash;`to protect the interests of the workers.' Here we are a decade down the line from that time when he was blockading the Wilderness Society and thousands of jobs had been shed out of the industry, not because of environmentalists but because of the big logging corporations. It is in their interests to foster their profit line by getting rid of workers. But 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is not in the national interest&mdash;it is in nobody's interest&mdash;that we foster a policy of unrestricted export of whole logs which could be processed within the country and create jobs here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that the 440,000 cubic metres of whole logs already licensed to be exported out of Tasmania would create 44 jobs in getting those plantation trees stripped, trucked and shipped out. Were those trees to be processed here in Australia, it would create 1,800 jobs. When is the Labor Party going to listen to what Senator Murphy has to say? When is it going to make him the minister for resource development for forests.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say what is involved there because Senator Collins does not seem to understand. A majority of that plantation timber is on public land, not on private land, which is where Senator Murphy's concern is. It is on public land where once native forests stood. It is on land that the taxpayers of this country have a say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1854"> on because it is their land. It is not the logging company's land; it is public land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those plantations are going to be knocked down and their timber exported elsewhere without us having the downstream benefit and opportunity for job creation in this country. That will be because of the regulation that the government is putting through here, which you, Senator Collins, are supporting. What is more, future native forests will be clobbered under this attitude of `Let the woodchip industry control the business' and `Let us divest the parliament of responsibility and export it.' Those lands will be turned into plantations where the industry deigns them to be. In the future there will be no licensing control of the export of those logs out of this country. That is how the whole process will go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you, Senator Collins, that when you were in government and the environment people, which you run down so readily, were lobbying as best as their hearts would let them on behalf of the majority of Australians to protect our native forests, the government was confronted with a blockade of this parliament&mdash;it was illegal; it would not have been allowed if they were environmentalists&mdash;basically at the behest of the CEOs on the list that you read out. They were the corporations facilitating that blockade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that blockade occurred, you sold out. Prime Minister Keating went weak at the knees. Let me give credit to former environment minister Senator John Faulkner, for he had come up with a list of forest areas in this country which were too precious to hand over to the woodchippers, limited as that list was. Prime Minister Keating brought you in and knocked the environment minister out of the way, and you presided over handing those forests to the woodchip industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, the logging corporations facilitated a blockade of this place. The Keating government went weak at the knees. They caved in. They sold out the forests. They sold out the interests of the Australian people. Part of the result of that has been a change of government, which is selling out even faster.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1855">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we have is that neither Labor nor Liberal has stood up for the public interest when it comes to the forests of Australia. Part of that awful failure to stand up for the national interests as far as our forests are concerned is re-emerging here today when Labor is going to support the Howard government in lifting any licence restrictions on the export of plantations out of this country as whole logs, and with them the export of jobs and the export of downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return to Senator Murphy, who, I think, made a very telling contribution to this debate from his position within the Labor Party benches. He said that the industry has huge potential but that it will do nothing if it is not guided in the right direction. That is what Senator Lees is saying. That is what Senator Margetts is saying. That is what this corner of the chamber&mdash;outgunned by Labor and Liberal&mdash;is saying as well. You do not overcome the problem by lifting what little restrictions there are on this industry, which is headed in the wrong direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that we are not going to have the numbers in the Senate, but I stand confident that we have the numbers on this matter when it comes to the Australian electorate. The opinion polls have repeatedly shown where the numbers stand as far as the logging industry&mdash;cutting into our native forests at a time when the plantation forests are available to meet our domestic supplies&mdash;is concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;With respect to the vote on the previous motion, I declared my interest, as did others, but I question the materiality of the matter which was brought forward by Senator Brown. It is hard for any of us to know whether, in fact, there is any material interest by owning shares in companies involved in pine plantations because you really do not know whether or not they are exporting logs. Be that as it may, I bring to the attention of the Senate that it is recorded in the register of senators' interests, as reported on 3 October last year, that Senator Brown holds a share in the Tasmanian Greens Pty Ltd and is also a director of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian Greens Pty Ltd is a proprietary company limited by shares and it lists its principal activity in the Australian Securities Commission database as political party administration. Information contained on the Internet in respect of the Tasmanian Greens party explains that the Tasmanian Greens Pty Ltd takes care of the financial concerns of the Tasmanian Greens and that its role is to keep track of budgets and cash flow, give approval for expenditure on behalf of the Tasmanian Greens and manage their wages fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bush Heritage Fund is a company limited by guarantee whose principal activity is the raising of funds towards the purchase of private land of environmental significance. The fund raises money to both 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purchase private land and generally manage that land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the role of the Tasmanian Greens Pty Ltd as fund raiser for the Tasmanian Greens and the fact that the political party's strident opposition to forest industries can be considered as a principal source from which it derives support, and further given that the Australian Bush Heritage Fund has both a direct and indirect benefit in land management issues in Australia, particularly the protection of various forms of forested areas, I wonder whether it is reasonable to conclude that Senator Brown by his shareholding and directorship has a potential conflict of interest in voting on matters relating to forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note these matters without criticising either the Tasmanian Greens Pty Ltd or the Australian Bush Heritage Fund. Rather, I note that Senator Brown has participated in debates here in the Senate on several occasions and again today on motions related to woodchips or logging and there have been two occasions prior to today since 3 October on which this has happened. On neither of these occasions did he consider it necessary to follow the Senate's resolutions on the registration and declaration of senators' interest. In particular, he did not consider it necessary to satisfy the terms of section 5 of that resolution by declaring a relevant interest either at the beginning of the speech or as soon as practicable after the relevant division on the vote was called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further note that Senator Brown on 14 October last year reflected on the propriety of honourable senators in this place by calling on those senators who had shareholdings in the companies which potentially stood to obtain a financial benefit as a result of decisions in the Senate in that instance to stand aside from voting on the motion. Furthermore, on 6 February last Senator Brown drew the attention of the Senate, quite rightly, to the fact that several senators had failed to satisfy the terms of the standing orders by declaring their interests at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Senate would be aware I, together with several others, had inadvertently failed to follow the correct procedure on that occasion but we made the appropriate declarations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1857"> at the earliest possible opportunity; that is, once the matter had been drawn to our attention. Given Senator Brown's demonstrated concern for propriety in this chamber, I call upon him to declare his interests and explain why he has failed to declare those interests at the relevant times since the 3 October event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, Madam President, I convey to you my concern that I believe the present operation of the standing orders in relation to declaration of interests in debate and at times of voting is quite ambiguous and leaves open to interpretation exactly what interests should be declared. I think the matter of materiality should be given consideration in those standing orders. They do nothing, in my opinion, to advance the disclosure of relevant interests to the Senate nor to the Australian people and therefore contribute nothing to the confidence of the Australian people in the parliament. I believe this matter needs to be looked into by a relevant committee of the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The irritability of the honourable senator is understandable, but the interests register is there for the purposes of making sure that we as senators do not take inappropriate interest in self-serving matters which are going to help line our pockets. We have to be very careful about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of the interests that the honourable senator has pointed out that I have in both the Greens and the Australian Bush Heritage Fund. They are not profit making ventures and they are not germane to the debate we have just had in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do understand your irritability, but the Senate has had long debate about this before. The rules are there. They are there to be acted upon. When you have such a clear interest in the matter of the logging industry that you have shares in the corporations making profits out of our private and public forests, you should declare that. It is as simple as that. If honourable senators opposite are obfuscated or feel aggrieved as far as the difficulty sometimes in putting your finger on what is a pecuniary interest or an interest in terms of this register is concerned, then that is a problem they will have to live with. I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> see any difficulty with the values that are incorporated in these rules for senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend, every time there is a vote like the one we have just had, to remind the Senate of the need to abide by these rules. They are sensible. They are there to help the public know that we are not lining our own pockets, that we are not going for a hidden pecuniary interest, that we are not fostering our own business connections or interests when we vote on matters in the Senate. I might add: it does not prevent us from voting. It simply says that we should make a declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear what the intention of the rules is. If you would like to seek a further ruling from the President in the matter, then I would be very happy to endorse that. I do not think it is necessary. I think the rules are quite explicit. I think the intention is quite explicit. As I say, I think it is a very healthy thing that senators who have a pecuniary interest or a self-interest of the sort that is meant by this register get up and declare it when they are voting on a matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was part way through my discussion on network boundary. As I said, the Green and Democrat amendments are identical in intent. I went on to say that there was no indication in the legislation that consumers would receive a compensatory reduction in their installation costs or line rental charges reflecting the fact that carriers are no longer liable for wiring between the building entry point and the first socket. These were the concerns raised by the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union and by consumer organisations such as the CTN.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, these amendments also remove the right of the government to redetermine the network boundary through regulations. The Democrats sought to remove this because the definition of the network boundary has a major impact on consumers and we believe it should be spelled out in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key problem with regulations as compared with legislation is that they offer significantly less opportunity for scrutiny. There is also the possibility that they will go by unnoticed by consumers or their representative organisations, particularly if the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment chooses not to make any announcements to the effect that they are seeking to redefine those network boundaries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is opposed to this proposition. The network boundary is an important factor in establishing the boundary between carrier equipment and cabling, and customer equipment and cabling. Its location is particularly crucial for competition. If I could just address some of the concerns that Senator Allison expressed, the location of the network boundary at the building entry point is not a conspiracy to save carriers money. It is in fact about providing an opportunity for the customers to have a choice. By definition, at least one carrier will suffer a disadvantage because it will remove a barrier to the introduction of competitive services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current location of the network boundary at the first socket or, in multi&hyphen;occupier buildings, at the main distribution frame works to the disadvantage of consumers by limiting the scope of competition for the installation of in&hyphen;building cabling, so customers have to pay the costs that their carriers decide to charge for cabling to the network boundary. It also makes it more expensive for customers to change carriers, because the carrier cannot connect at the network boundary and make use of existing in&hyphen;building cabling; it must install new cabling. This makes the introduction of competitive services more expensive than necessary and requires more cabling to be installed in houses while existing cabling is left unused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition went through this some years ago. Clearly, the closer the network boundary is to the actual handset, the less opportunity there is for competition and, therefore, choice and reduced prices. If you simply have a single carrier providing all of that service, then it is a monopoly service. If you allow competition, but nonetheless have that network boundary point very close to the handset, then the opportunities for in&hyphen;building competition or, in practical terms, to make your own arrangements for maintenance are dramatically reduced because there is hardly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1859"> any length of cabling that could be put in on a competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important element of competition to ensure that customers are able to choose that carriers will presumably continue to offer maintenance options. There ought to be the maximum scope for the carriers to do that, rather than having it minimised back to the closest point to the handset. For those reasons, we would oppose the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, you are not wrong to say that the Labor Party in government grappled with this argument about where the boundary of the network is. I suspect that as long as we have a telecommunications system with some national interests around, that argument will continue. My question about the structure of the present government legislation refers to page 31 of the Telecommunications Bill where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) If no regulations are in force for the purposes of subsection (1), then, for the purposes of sections 20 and 21, the boundary of a telecommunications network is:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then outlines what that is in (a), (b) and (c) and, over the page, it outlines what a building entry point is. It then outlines what a building is, which includes `a structure, a caravan and a mobile home'. I am not quite sure that, in a building industry definition, you would be able to say that a building is a caravan or a mobile home, but I understand why you have had to do that in terms of the Telecommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, do you have any plans that, when this is put through, that there will be generic regulations? Or will regulations only be brought in specifically for some special areas about the network boundary? You outline a description in (a), (b) and (c) that seems to me to be a pretty standard description. I just want to know whether it will be the exception to have regulations or a general rule to have regulations about what the boundary network is.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that Austel has advised that it is not considered necessary at this stage to have regulations or guidelines but they would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reserve the right to do that if problems emerged. But the starting point is to assume that there will be sufficient competition and the carriers and customers will be able to reach agreement which will not cause difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that. In this definition about going to the entry point, particularly for a strata title building with many residents et cetera, the concern I have is really on the consumer side. It is about the simplicity of inquiring, if there is a malfunction or a fault. If the wire from the outside of the building in through to the actual flat or unit in the building is not part of the network boundary, that means that if the consumer has a problem they have to make a different phone call. How do they know who they ring to get that cable line fixed?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing is that they ring Telstra or Optus, who are maybe the two in the local loop at the moment with more to come. If they are a subscriber to Telstra, how do they know that the cable from the outside of the building to the socket inside their unit is actually a Telstra responsibility? Where do they go and find who should fix it? If the building owner has done a different deal on wiring and so on and has got a different contract, maybe with a small independent electrical contractor, then I can see that some consumers are going to start arguing, or are going to find it difficult to get it fixed in an expeditious way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the competition argument but, in considering this, I want to try to balance that with the convenience of consumers getting quick access to how it is going to be fixed without being frustrated that you are going to have to make several phone calls to find out who is actually responsible for that last bit of cabling. The first thing that will happen is that Telstra will say, `It is not in our line, check your own internal line.' If you go to them further, they will say that it is probably Telstra's, back at the exchange. As we all know, that is the first device any bureaucracy, public or private, usually uses, to the frustration of customers. So that is an issue I wanted to raise: how the customer knows who to ring for a fault if they can try 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1860"> and find the fault in that part of the cable that is no longer part of the network.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that, in most instances, you would expect the carriers to offer a maintenance option. In other words, it will be business as usual for a great number of customers. It will only be for those who choose not to have the carrier accept responsibility for the in&hyphen;house cabling or maintenance where the alternative would arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where you have got buildings that have a number of tenants in them, you could expect as a matter of practicality that there would be one person responsible for that for all tenants. It is most unlikely that you would be having a series of different arrangements. That is because in practice telephone systems do not break down all that often, and the need for that would not arise very frequently. It would therefore make sense to have one carrier or alternative tradesman responsible for those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be a bit more I can add to that. It is that, in all cases, the carrier will test the line and determine whether the fault is on the carrier's or the customer's side of the network boundary. So in the first instance it would be business as usual, you would call your carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the fault is in the network, the carrier must fix this free of charge. If the fault is in the customer's cabling and if the customer has a cabling maintenance agreement with that carrier&mdash;which is what I was saying before&mdash;then the carrier will fix the problem. The carrier would be expected to do that on a contractual basis. If the customer has another arrangement, obviously the customer would call in that other person. So, in practice, it would only be those people who were proactively seeking to move away from the carriers who would have that alternative. Therefore, you would be aware of the fact that you had made other arrangements.</PARA></SPEECH>

What happens if you get a lot of different tenants&mdash;a multitude of tenants, to use your phrase I overheard&mdash;using different carriers? Who is responsible for the various wirings?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were just saying that you would expect the body corporate to be responsible for those arrangements. Where you have a number of tenants, there would normally be a central organisation&mdash;a body corporate&mdash;responsible for a whole range of maintenance facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me intuitively as being like an opt out situation. In other words, people would be connected to their carrier of choice. That carrier would charge them a maintenance fee, and that is who they would go to as a first and last port of call. It is only if they were consciously wanting their maintenance done by someone other than their own carrier that they would go to that other person, and they would know who that person was because they had made that conscious choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in practice, the vast majority of people will either rely on the body corporate or rely on the carrier because they will have built the maintenance fee into their rental charge. It is only those people in the population who actually see the competitive benefit from getting an alternative to their own carrier who would go elsewhere, and those people, by definition, would know where to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just on this point, I think what we are talking about now is the actual demarcation point of the local loop. The minute you identify a body corporate as being the responsible party for cabling at the point of entry to a large block of flats&mdash;perhaps with a whole range of interconnected buildings&mdash;the distinction is drawn about the point of entry. How would you subsequently define that point of entry in a physical sense?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned greatly about the notion that a body corporate would be responsible for the cabling at the point of entry to the building as opposed to the socket. That really does beg a physical definition of what constitutes a building, a structure and so forth. I ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to think of this debate in those terms. How can we define anything other than the socket as being where the boundary of a network exists? It really opens up a can of worms that probably is not warranted at this stage because it can be dealt with quite succinctly with the amendment that we are debating.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are opening a can of worms that is already well and truly open and thriving because the main distribution frame is the point at which responsibility for maintaining the cables inside those premises ceases. That does not cause any difficulties in housing estates or other areas where there are a large number of tenants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you still get back to the proposition that, if you take out a telephone line, if you rent a service, you will do it with a carrier of your choice and you will decide whether you want that carrier to continue to be responsible for maintenance. In most instances, I would expect that that would be the choice you would make. If you choose not to, then by definition you are aware that you have chosen not to use that carrier but you are prepared to make other maintenance arrangements. These are, in most instances, almost hypothetical because the need will not arise. But you will be aware that you have made that choice. If 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you have forgotten, the carrier will remind you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that all that is doing is providing you with an opportunity of choice which is not there at the moment. If you are simply required to have the carrier provide the service right up to a point close to the handset, then there is very little opportunity to do anything other than take what is a monopoly service from that carrier. That is obviously more expensive. You are better as a customer from having the choice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not being restricted in having access to choosing any of the carriers who come along. If, for example, the cable at the moment goes to the socket and stays that way&mdash;and that is a Telstra installation, for historical reasons&mdash;and the consumer gets a better telephone deal on calls, packages et cetera from Optus and switches as a subscriber to Optus, Telstra does not go and pull the cable out, or Optus does not go and pull the cable out and re&hyphen;lay cable. They switch over and the infrastructure stays the same, because you do not rewire a building or your home just because you have changed subscribers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I understand all the arrangements for the interconnect are about, so that if you change the carrier, the cable is still the same. You might change the phone that plugs into the socket, because that is part of the deal, but you go back to the exchange, therefore that is an arrangement where there is an interconnect. It is Telstra's infrastructure which is being used and therefore they will charge Optus&mdash;if it is the new carrier for that subscriber&mdash;the appropriate interconnect fee that takes account of how they interconnect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real nightmare, in my view, might occur when you start having second and third carriers rolling around putting second and third cable ducts into buildings, like off the Optus cable outside which you can now see&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1862"> and we have had arguments about that earlier today. If this means that second and third cables are going to be rethreaded into buildings so that that is the way the carrier comes in, I think the public are going to start saying, `This is getting out of hand. We don't need three water pipes or three gas pipes or three electricity wires coming in. Why don't we just have one wire? We can change between our carriers using the same infrastructure and the appropriate interconnect fee is there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that happens, then I believe the maintenance issue handles itself: Telstra does the maintenance and puts that into their interconnect fee, and the customer knows who they ring up to get it fixed. Minister, if you go back to the kerb or the outside of the building, where the network ends, why not take it right back to the exchange? We had some evidence put before us at the Senate inquiry that, if you really want competition, let the consumer own the pair right back to the exchange and, at the exchange level, they will then have an ability to argue, `I do not want to be with any of you. You adapt the equipment at the exchange.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This created considerable gulping of fresh air by Telstra, in particular, and Optus that the network would be so defined. Although we did not discuss this network issue at great length in the Senate committee, I may suggest after we had have this discussion that we should let this sit for a while, see how the new regulatory regime works in real practical terms and maybe revisit it in a couple of years. I cannot get clear the real advantage to the consumer in having the network shifted to the outside of the building from the socket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand it if it is simply a freestanding home because, in a sense, I do not think it is that complicated. But where you have a strata title building, which has a landlord and a strata title company involved, and people in the same building choosing to swap between carriers, they are not going to pull the lines out and redo them. The same line will be used. Therefore, if that is the Telstra line that is there at the moment, I believe people would expect them to be responsible for the maintenance and Telstra would then put that charge into its intercon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nect fee if someone wants to go to Optus or Vodafone. It seems to me that this may not be a necessary issue for pure competition issues.

What happens is that you ring the carriers, the body corporate, the housing trust or whoever is responsible if you have a problem. The reality is that people very rarely have a problem so it does not cause difficulties. But what would be able to happen under this arrangement is that if you make the boundary the telephone socket, that would

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your taking it right back to the exchange example is not simply an extension of the same principle at all, because once you get beyond the property perimeter you are getting into a whole area where faults can happen through no fault of anyone and where you would expect the carrier to be responsible. There might be an accident or there might be all sorts of breakdowns that it would not in any shape or form be realistic to expect an individual customer to solve. By that point individual lines have merged into a trunk line and individuals could not be responsible for all sending their own maintenance people in to fix the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So once you get beyond the building line, or the property perimeter at the most, it seems to me you are talking about common property.

The alternative carrier has to provide a competing line to the network termination point. It is convenient to do that if it is at the building entry point on the outside of the building. But it is highly inconvenient, and obviously much more expensive, if the network boundary point is the wall socket, because that means that the second line has to be brought right inside the house up to that connection point.

If the boundary point is at the socket inside the house, or particularly a multiple&hyphen;residence block of flats of strata title, you are saying that, because it is owned by Telstra and the person swaps to another carrier, that new carrier&mdash;presumably Optus, in most cases, to start off with&mdash;would not only have to provide a new cable coming in to the outside of the house or the building, but also have to thread a new cable up to the wall socket inside the subscriber's home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will preface my remarks on the Euthanasia Laws Bill first of all by thanking all those individuals, groups and churches who have taken the time and trouble to provide me with opinions and advice. It is clear from the letters and submissions I have received that their authors were motivated by deeply held personal or professional beliefs. Those who called and wrote were not motivated by anything other than their own deeply held convictions, and sought only what they truly believed was in the best interests for Australia and for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found much in the submissions, the letters and the calls that moved me. There are few words in the English language that evoke a universally intense emotional response, but `euthanasia' is one such word. `Love', `life' and `death' are other words that have a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> universal intellectual and emotional effect on us. That all four words are deeply linked does not come as a surprise, for these are words that reflect on our human existence and confront our humanity as individuals and as a society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the word `euthanasia' evokes such a powerful response, few people would have difficulty with its actual meaning. `Euthanasia' literally means `a quiet and easy death'. I would suggest that the majority of people would endorse the hope expressed in the meaning of the word. I feel sure that a quiet and easy death is a private and heartfelt desire of everyone. Who here today would not wish for such a death&mdash;not only for themselves but for all their loved ones? It is my belief that we would all seek a quiet and easy death, if the choice were ours alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the literal meaning of the word is not a problem, then what is the matter of contention? Opposition to euthanasia is not opposition to the idea of a good death, for who would argue that death should be painful, protracted or degrading? Rather then, opposition to euthanasia is something else. What then are we debating here today if euthanasia per se is not the issue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, in fact, debating the right of parliament to make laws that have an effect on private morality. We are seeking an answer to the questions, `Do the terminally ill have the right to make a decision regarding the manner in which they will die?' and `Can the terminally ill person take responsibility for that decision?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also debating the past, present and future ethical behaviour of the medical profession. In essence, we are debating the following questions: firstly, do we as individuals have the right to advance death by actively participating in our own death; secondly, should we have the right to decide the time, place and manner of our own death; and, thirdly, is the current medical practice of pain relief, which inevitably causes death, acceptable in our society and should it be allowed to continue? I believe that to the first two questions the answer is yes, and to the last question the answer is no. Based on these answers, I speak today in opposition to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1868"> Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, the so&hyphen;called Andrews bill, and in support of the Northern Territory's groundbreaking legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very rarely do those of us who are elected to parliament get to debate issues of private and public morality&mdash;and perhaps that is as it should be. An individual's moral code should not be the subject of public debate and/or scrutiny, unless through public behaviour it impinges directly on the moral codes and ethical behaviours of significant others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our private moral codes are the very core values by which we test our belief systems and against which we moderate our private and public behaviours. For those of us who believe that we are all essentially moral beings, our individual system of ethics dictates our actions and governs our decisions and, as such, are private. It is when the private moral beliefs become desires and these desires fall within the view of others&mdash;that is, public actions&mdash;that, as legislators, we are faced with the dilemma of private versus public morality, private behaviour versus public behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not seek to argue with those who support the bill as a matter of faith alone. However, I do take issue with those honourable senators who would seek to impose their private faith on others with the force of law. I also take issue with those honourable senators and others who seek to oppose the bill for other reasons. In particular, I take issue with those senators who use the so&hyphen;called thin end of the wedge or the slippery slope argument as sufficient reason to support the bill. Their argument is fallacious. I would suggest that the Northern Territory's act will not open the floodgates. Rather, it will in fact reduce the number of assisted deaths by providing strict guidelines for medical staff to adhere to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation almost requires doctors to play God. Current practice provides no safeguards for either the medical or nursing professions. The practice of passive non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia&mdash;that is, either the withdrawal of treatment or allowing to die&mdash;is widespread in Australia today. That the practice of passive non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia is widespread will not come as a surprise to most people in this chamber&mdash;after all, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have all known about such things for years. What is so sad is that the current practices have been allowed to develop to the present state where almost one&hyphen;third of deaths can either be attributed to acts of omission or commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt in my mind that, as I speak, an Australian will be having their treatment stopped or withdrawn&mdash;that is, a life will be shortened or ended following a decision by someone else, a decision to which that person will have had little or no input and for which no consent was sought or given. In survey after survey, both the medical and nursing professions admit to taking active steps to help their patients die. Sometimes nurses act on the instruction or request of a medical practitioner; in some cases, they act alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a 1992 survey of Victorian nurses, one in 10 respondents admitted to acceding to patients' requests without a doctor's instructions, while a quarter of respondents admitted to being asked to help patients die by the patients' treating doctors. The figures for the medical profession are even more telling. In a survey completed in 1994, one in eight New South Wales doctors said that they had taken active steps to help patients die. The New South Wales figures are very much in line with those from previous studies carried out in South Australia and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those early figures represent the tip of the iceberg. The latest study reveals that 30 per cent of all Australian deaths came after a decision to end the patient's life. These deaths came as a consequence of treatment being withdrawn or withheld or where lethal drugs were administered. These deaths were almost all, without question, carried out as acts of compassion and love. Many would have been carried out at the request of the patient and some at the request of loving relatives. Yet how many were carried out with the full knowledge and consent of the patient? How many were carried out as a matter of hospital economic expediency? What safeguards were in place for the patient, his or her relatives or, for that matter, the professional who acceded to the request? In almost every case, the answer must be none&mdash;for each act was an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1869"> illegal act and could have led to the nurse or doctor being charged with murder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Andrews bill, if passed, will not end the current practices of the caring professions; it will entrench them and drive them ever further into the shadows. Doctors and nurses should not have to play God. Patients should have a means by which they can seek an end to suffering that is open and subject to scrutiny. Under these conditions, the number of cases of euthanasia may well fall. This is the exact opposite effect of the much propounded slippery slope argument to which I now turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the slippery slope argument, the current Northern Territory law opens the door to some future government endorsing, and then practising, non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia&mdash;that is, compulsory euthanasia. The slippery slope argument is emotive and frequently seeks to conjure up some of the worst images of this century. At its worst, the slippery slope argument attempts to link the Australian euthanasia program with the Nazi death camps; at a lesser level, it is claimed that somehow it will lead to a secular society that devalues moral values and must inevitably lead to attempts to widen the terms of reference by which an individual may seek to end their own life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That anyone should attempt to link the Northern Territory act and voluntary euthanasia with the horrors of six million dead in the European death camps is odious. Any attempt to link the compassion of the Northern Territory's voluntary euthanasia act to the holocaust is to the discredit of the person who would advance such an argument. The slippery slope argument exists only to scare the vulnerable; it has no merit, it is preposterous and it is false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that the slippery slope argument at its most emotive is abhorrent, it is also necessary to refute the lesser argument, and that is that the practice of voluntary euthanasia must lead to more and more deaths. I agree that the proposed practice requires a very strict test and safeguards; it also requires an equally strict evaluation procedure. Much has been written and spoken about medically induced death as it has been practised in Holland. Much of what has been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> written and said is highly emotive. I note that the Tasmanian journal of the AMA asserts that patients in Holland request `not for euthanasia' signs over their beds yet this journal offers no proof of its assertion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul J van der Maas et al writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> of November 1996 found `no signs of an unacceptable increase in the number of decisions or of less careful decision making'. While the findings of the Dutch may not impress the proponents of this bill, in my view it is up to them to prove the slippery slope argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that like most of us much of my correspondence has concerned the provision and excellence of palliative care. The argument most frequently advanced in these letters is that somehow the provision of voluntary euthanasia negates or undermines the provision of good palliative care. As I see it, the right to voluntary euthanasia can only enhance the last days, weeks, or hours for those who choose that course. Voluntary euthanasia is not the negation of palliative care. Good palliative care has provided and will continue to provide quality end of life care for far more people than will ever choose voluntary euthanasia. I know of no proponent of voluntary euthanasia who sees it as being in conflict with or in any way replacing quality end of life care, be that in the home or in a hospice. Rather it is seen as an integral part or an extension of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to address those senators who would seek to preserve the present medical position; that is, the medical status quo with individual medical professionals deciding a person's fate as an acceptable alternative to voluntary euthanasia. I believe that the current widely held medical practices involved with death are no longer tenable, and at their worst are hypocritical. The medical status quo is variable, unregulated; it is the luck of the draw. A person who wants to die may be lucky that they have a doctor who will help them, equally they may not have a doctor who is prepared to help them. They may have a doctor who shares their views and moral position, or they may not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Senate's attention to the use of the ethical doctrine of double effect to pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1870"> vide a shield for current medical practice. The doctrine of double effect provides an ethical smokescreen to cover medical practitioners from both legal and moral sanctions. The doctrine of double effect differentiates between a predictable or foreseen outcome of a voluntary action and an unintended outcome. Therefore, when the stated outcome of an action is the relief of pain and suffering, even when such treatment leads to pharmacological oblivion and death, it is ethical even though, as a consequence of the action or actions, human life is shortened or ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the fact that most often medical and nursing behaviours are both caring and compassionate. However, whenever the doctrine of double effect is used to justify behaviour that leads to death, therein lies a terrible double standard. At its worst the doctrine of double effect can be used to justify what is in reality an act of extreme medical paternalism. The doctrine of double effect allows doctors to decide what is best for their patients just so long as the doctor acts with only one intent, that is the relief of pain. Such treatment can be given without any requirement for specific consent from either the patient or family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In arguing for consent I believe that consent should also be sought and given for all treatments, and that includes the current medical practice of withdrawing treatment. The withdrawal of treatment requires a decision and an action and should therefore require the consent of the patient, or where this is not possible the next of kin. The present medical practice of allowing a person to die has been described by the Tasmanian president of the AMA as `good medical practice'. I would agree with him if the patient has consented, and I would disagree with him if the decision was that of a doctor alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I am voting against the Andrews bill because it seeks to impose that member's personal morality on the vast majority of Australians who do not share it. I vote against the bill because I do not believe that a citizen's liberty should be restricted on no better grounds than that others disapprove of that citizen's personal choice. I vote for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those Australians who will have their lives enriched by the knowledge that they will have their personal liberty extended by being given a choice that they do not now enjoy and that this choice will be protected in law. I will vote against the bill because I believe in choice. The majority of Australians want to be able to chose. They want to be in control of their death just as they want to be in control of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The polls show that the majority of Australians do not want an anonymous professional, however well motivated and caring, choosing the time, place and manner of their death. The majority of Australians want to make their own final decision, which may be to continue living or it may be to die. Whatever the decision, it requires individual consent and then it requires that the individual take responsibility for their final decisions. I believe that rather than weakening the structure and fabric of Australian society the Northern Territory's act is a sign of our society's maturity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is certainly a very difficult issue, which I am sure everyone in this place has spent a considerable amount of time thinking and reading about, and indeed reading about from the many who have written to us. It is far from simple and it is far from straightforward. It is a difficult emotional issue and it is one on which I alone have received nearly 1,000 letters, so I can imagine how many letters have been written to all of us in this place on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On both sides of the argument about voluntary euthanasia there are clearly some very determined and dedicated campaigners&mdash;some of them I suspect have been doing work on this issue for a long time. Between those two extremes is the bulk of the Australian community. The vast majority of those people are in favour of the right to choose the time to end their own life if it becomes intolerable and if there is no hope for recovery and they are in distress, severe pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a practising Christian and I have heard arguments about the sanctity of life from other Christians in this place who oppose 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1871"> voluntary euthanasia. So I want to spend a bit of time talking about this sanctity of life issue. I will begin by looking at some of the decisions that parliaments make that have an impact on the sanctity of life, but which never generate the same sort of public response or media interest as this decision that the Northern Territory has made about euthanasia has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those speaking in support of Mr Andrews's bill argue that parliament should never make a decision that may mean a life is ended before its allotted time&mdash;that is, that there should be no intervention that may mean a life is deliberately or intentionally shortened. But where were some of those same people just a few years ago when this parliament made a decision to involve this country in the Gulf War? I did not hear those people stand up then and talk about this being a sanctity of life issue. Surely any parliament that sends its troops away has an understanding that there is a risk and that some of their lives may be shortened by those actions. Indeed, it was not just this parliament but other parliaments in this country who sent people away to the Vietnam War, the First World War and the Second World War. Surely the people making those decisions realised the risk was there. Surely they knew that those troops were possibly being sent away to die prematurely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those in this place who happily accept that Australia year after year is putting less and less money into programs that would give people in the Third World a better quality of life and who argue that we cannot afford to put money into aid projects that will in many instances ensure these people live longer, healthier and more comfortable lives. To me that is a very real and urgent sanctity of life issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government very recently, indeed very belatedly&mdash;it would have been nice if the previous government had done it&mdash;made the decision to work for an international ban on land mines, but for year after year there were people in this place who were quite comfortable in the knowledge that these appalling weapons were out there and they were causing hideous injuries and death to innocent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> women and children in other parts of the world. Surely that is an issue about the sanctity of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people condone, merely on economic grounds, the selling of weapons of war to other nations knowing that those weapons are going to be used to kill and maim people. I would go so far as to argue that many of those people who actively promote the mining and milling of uranium know that the product produced and exported is not always being used for peaceful purposes. While things may have improved now, that certainly was not the case a short time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, all these issues are sanctity of life issues&mdash;issues which involve not just the lives and well-being of individuals here and now but those of future generations. These are issues where people condone or tolerate actions which prematurely end the lives of others. Yet where is the same level of angst, the same level of concern, and, indeed, the same level of parliamentary time set aside to debate these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that people basically reserve their concern&mdash;and certainly considerable angst&mdash;when the issue of sanctity of life involves the actual ending of someone's life when they choose. All this angst is missing when we are talking about issues over which the person has no control&mdash;in other words, when someone else's decision will end their life or create for them a life of misery. I have great difficulty when listening to some of these arguments because what we are really talking about is a person's right to choose&mdash;a person's right to say to their family or to their doctor, `I have had enough. It is intolerable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue nearer to home that has caused me a great deal of angst is what we are doing to our young people. We are putting our young people under more and more stress as support for them to study is reduced. With the new changes we now see that the support for them to get accommodation has been reduced. Their access to social security is becoming more difficult. Looking at the number of breaches, you find that it is basically young people who simply do not understand the system who breach the system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1872">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of government looking to invest in jobs which are becoming rare, young people are now being told that they are going to have to work for the dole. They cannot be left to look for jobs on their own. We are constantly increasing the pressures on young people. Yet we say on the other hand that we have to do something about youth suicide. We are not investing in the sorts of things that would turn young people away from despair and hopelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put very high on the list employment, free education, access to good health care, access to mental health and promises from politicians that really mean something in terms of training and opportunities. I would argue that many of the decisions in this place have very much had an impact on that critical sanctity of life issue. I would argue that the energies and efforts put into this debate would surely have been better directed towards reducing the number of young people and young adults who take their lives rather than taking an option away from people who are in such distress and such pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I cannot accept the argument that the debate on this particular bill is somehow more about the sanctity of life than all those other debates that we have had. I think it is a great pity that some of those letters that have been written to me from so many people put so much emphasis on what really is a matter of choice. It would have been nice to have so many letters on Aboriginal health, on foreign aid and on youth suicide. The difference with this issue is that we are not imposing on other people; we are simply giving individuals the right to choose, the right to choose the time and the circumstances of their death, and that would generally be a death in the company of their family and loved ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a decision is an incredibly personal one, and one that I believe should be left to individuals and their families and, of course, where needed, the doctor, if he or she is willing. As we see from the Northern Territory legislation, the safeguards are there for a number of doctors to be involved, and that is why I totally reject this slippery slope theory that seems to have crept into some of the speeches. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many different religious and philosophical views in the world and in this country. To a great many Australians, voluntary euthanasia is an acceptable way of terminating their life because it is part, and often a central part, of their religious beliefs and their philosophies. Those Australians tend to place the notion of quality of life ahead of the sanctity of life. Their views should be respected and this parliament should not seek to impose on them a different set of beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will be voting against Mr Andrews's bill. Yes, I realise the Northern Territory senators and particularly those from the ACT are very interested because it is a state and territory issue, but it is not for that reason. It is obviously a territory issue but, more importantly, it is an individual issue. We will be reducing the likelihood of prosecution for the families and friends and perhaps medical people involved in helping someone to end their life through their own choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My only reservations involve the concerns of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. I note the Northern and Central Land Council's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which made the point that the council did not seek to make any statement on euthanasia as such but was concerned about the process and context of the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory have so little confidence in the capacity of their government to protect their interests. I believe their concerns, at heart, relate to that lack of confidence and that is the result of the neglect, abuse, misunderstanding and lack of resources and compassion that they continue to endure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very special opportunity given to me to take part in the Senate's inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1873"> enabled me to question key witnesses and, more importantly, to listen to a wide range of views from both highly qualified witnesses and those whose options and opinions represent a large number of ordinary men and women in the community. For me, it was a particularly valuable experience which I shall never forget, and the views expressed ranged from stories of terrible suffering and sadness to those who spoke of the great benefit provided by palliative care teams in both home and hospice. I approached this very difficult issue with an open mind and I am grateful to the wide range of people who offered me wise counsel on many points of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions about the Northern Territory legislation which arise in my mind cover three particular areas. Firstly, how does a law permitting voluntary euthanasia impact on various vulnerable and disadvantaged groups? Many of my early concerns on behalf of these people were reinforced and strengthened during the committee's public hearings and in the letters I received. There is also no doubt that some of the older members of our community, experiencing for perhaps the first time some of the more serious medical difficulties of ageing, believe that they may be approaching the age where they should helpfully remove themselves as a potential burden to their families using the means the Northern Territory legislation currently offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second question concerns that other significant group clearly feeling seriously threatened and, in some cases, likely to be deterred from seeking medical treatment as a result of the rights of the terminally ill legislation. These people are the 40,000 Aboriginal residents of the Northern Territory. My early concern about this group was that they comprise almost a quarter of the territory's population and yet were not formally consulted prior to the introduction of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Chips Mackinolty, who was engaged by the Northern Territory government to devise an Aboriginal education campaign after the bill had been passed, gave valuable confirmation of this lack of consultation. Mr Mackinolty's work with Aboriginal communities in remote areas showed very clearly that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation had the potential to damage the hard won reputation of the territory health service among indigenous families, and none of us needs to be reminded of the critical need to improve the health of our Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the existence of the territory legislation deters communities or individuals from seeking medical advice, surely the appropriateness of this legislation must be seriously questioned. The view among some that a fear campaign had been deliberately spread through these remote indigenous communities was dismissed by Reverend Gondarra who told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not frightening people. We are telling them the truth about this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Notwithstanding the assurances of these respected spokespeople, there is no doubt in my mind that many Aborigines consider the Northern Territory legislation to be `sorcerer's law' and it may well affect their individual health care decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final focus in this offering arose not as a result of evidence presented to the committee but from the comments of a group of very special people in my home state of South Australia who form the palliative care team at the Mary Potter Hospice in Adelaide and with whom I spent some very valuable time last week. I visited the hospice, for the first time actually, to resolve in my mind questions relating to the medical options available to the terminally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the highly professional and compassionate leadership of the medical director, Dr Mary Brooksbank, the staff provide a range of specialised services and compassionate care in the final days and weeks of terminal illness. Their service offers the active and total care of patients at a time when their illness or disease is no longer responsive to curative treatment and when control of pain, or other symptoms, and of psychological, social and spiritual problems, is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using a range of sophisticated medical technologies, mixed with a liberal dose of human kindness, this highly trained group offers a support system to help their patients live as actively as possible as their lives come to a close. Numbers of patients enter Mary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1874"> Potter anxious to bring their lives to a rapid conclusion&mdash;increasing medical discomfort having made their lives unbearable&mdash;with early death appearing the only option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Brooksbank and in fact other palliative care specialists who addressed the committee assert that pain can be managed, that the `hard death' referred to by some other groups and witnesses that addressed the committee is not a necessary by&hyphen;product of unmanaged or unmanageable pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This hospice wing in Adelaide has only 16 beds and yet it is able to offer dignity at the end of life to 400 patients a year and bereavement counselling to hundreds of other families. Another 200 or so patients are treated in their homes through an outreach service because there are simply not enough hospice beds. Surely, this is where a priority must lie, where valuable health funds must be spent, where our end of life decisions can take place&mdash;supported by the best medical technology available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have deliberately chosen not to refer tonight to the end of life decisions made by members of my own family and friends. Suffice to say that they reflect the views and experiences expressed by many in this chamber. Nobody wants to see a loved one suffer and as we contemplate the end of our lives each one of us optimistically contemplates a peaceful passing, with as much choice as possible at that time. I left the Mary Potter Hospice confident that my apprehension about the medical ability to manage terminal pain had been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to address one of the cornerstones of the pro voluntary euthanasia arguments, whose proponents argue that it is currently not legal in Australian states to intentionally request that a life be prematurely ended. These people say that only when the Northern Territory legislation was enacted could such a choice be legally fulfilled. Curiously, however, it seems to me that the Northern Territory legislation, in codifying and legalising the means by which it is possible to choose a premature death, an early death, may have in fact set down what is an indisputable and therefore far less flexible nine&hyphen;day pathway to death.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine days&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no short cuts. Is that really an enhanced choice? Or has it, in establishing such an inflexible pathway, in fact reduced the means by which other terminally ill people around Australia right now are quietly making individual medical decisions and choices with their families and their doctors which will effectively shorten their lives by hours, days or weeks? Is this quite lengthy process in the Northern Territory really extending the life choices available to Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baume and Kuhse in their recently published work, which they claimed demonstrated support for a change in the law, in fact showed that one in three deaths in Australia at present occurs prematurely as a result of a medical intervention. Surely, this is clear evidence that the laws as they stand have enabled thousands of individuals to make their own flexible end of life decisions right now, without a journey to the Northern Territory, a computer keyboard or a willing medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power of the Commonwealth to overturn the Northern Territory's legislation has been well argued in this place by others, and I do not propose to canvass it again tonight. But it is interesting, isn't it, that this piece of legislation is available without any residential qualification at all to any Australian, regardless of their home address, if they are willing and able to travel to Darwin? And that is a point well understood by Mr Marshall Perron. It is therefore effectively national legislation available only in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have valued very much the opportunity to take part in this debate and also in the Senate inquiry, where a wide range of compelling evidence supporting the Andrews bill was presented and ultimately accepted by me. I now indicate my support for the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1874" TIME="7.29 p.m." SPEAKER="McKiernan, Sen James" NAMEID="1I4" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some debates that occur in this place that we as members of parliament and elected representatives look forward to participating in and there are others that we seek to avoid. This is one that I certainly would have sought to avoid, but I think it is incumbent upon me as a representa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1875"> tive of my state of Western Australia to clearly put on the record some of the views that I have on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Before I address the issues contained in the Euthanasia Laws Bill, there are a couple of things I want to mention in acknowledgment. I acknowledge Senator Tambling and the badge that he distributed to all of us yesterday in this place&mdash;a badge that depicted the flag of the Northern Territory&mdash;and he asked each of us to wear it as a mark that we respected the rights of the citizens firstly of the Northern Territory but also, I understand, of the other territories that are impacted and infringed by the content of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make a deliberate point of mentioning that because I have a notice of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, which I understand has upset some people in the Northern Territory because of its content, but I think the people understand where I am coming from. I wear Senator Tambling's badge on the collar of my shirt, which is the custom in the Northern Territory because I understand they do not wear jackets in that chamber there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, before I get into the body of the bill, I want to acknowledge the work of the secretariat of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee who are acknowledged in the report of the committee which was brought to this place the week before last. Neil Bessell and his team of people did a magnificent job&mdash;a job that they will probably never get the full recognition for. To cope with the numbers of submissions on their own was just a fantastic effort, but to do that and to do it with good grace at the same time was just stupendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not the only work the secretariat of that committee were engaged in. They were involved in numerous other works, both the references committee and the legislation committee. As a matter of fact, when the legislation committee held its public hearing in Darwin on the Euthanasia Laws Bill, we coincided that with a public hearing to take evidence on the legal aid inquiry. So I do publicly recognise the work of Neil and his team, commend him for that work and, on behalf of the Senate, thank him for that work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was one of the people who entered into this debate and the debate of the committee with an open mind. I did not have the benefit, like some of my colleagues in this place obviously have, of knowing where we are going on the bill and how we would do it before I listened to the evidence that was given in the public inquiry and through the submissions. I listened carefully to the arguments that were put and, as a member of the committee, took the opportunity to ask questions of those who came before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the record will show that the stream of my questioning was not along one particular line or pushing one particular barrow&mdash;be it in favour or in opposition to the content of the bill and the effect of the bill. I tried to do it as objectively as I could. I formed the view during the committee work that some of my colleagues were blessed in other directions and that they were the fount of all knowledge on the impact of this bill. That being the case for them, good luck to them, but it certainly was not the case for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are expectations in the community that, because of my birthright and the religion that I was brought into, I would automatically follow a particular line. I do not think as a member of this place that I am obliged to do that on each and every occasion. Certainly, when it is a matter of conscience vote, I do have to be aware of what my constituents are after. I, like every other member of the Senate and indeed probably every member of the Commonwealth parliament, have been inundated with letters, with telephone calls and with faxes and have been met in the street and encouraged to follow particular lines. The numbers of submissions that the committee has received is on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my point of view, when the debate occurred in this place about the reference of the bill to the legal and constitutional committee, I made the point then of the numbers of letters I had received from constituents in my state about the bill at that time. I have&mdash;and I say this with some degree of confidence although I have not signed each and every letter&mdash;replied to every letter that was written to me from within my constituency of West 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1876"> ern Australia. The replies took the form of form letters and I apologise to the individuals for doing that, but many of the letters that I received were also form letters. I will give an example of a letter&mdash;and I am not going to give the name of this individual&mdash;which was typical of many that I received during the course of the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you to ask you to vote for the Andrews Bill. I am very opposed to euthanasia as it is using killing to solve a social problem. If doctors are allowed to kill patients eventually, despite any safeguards, it will be easier, cheaper and quicker to kill than to care for the sick, elderly and vulnerable in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">God gave us life and God will take it in His time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was typical of the letters that I received. Some of the people who wrote to me actually put their telephone numbers on them or I took the initiative myself to ring them after searching through the phone books. Many of the people did not know what was contained in the Andrews bill. They did not know the impact of it but they were scared about it. I did not seek to talk them out of their position. Clearly, there were a number of very frightened people in our community. For those that perpetrated that fear, they will have to answer in their own time. I think what some people have done on this is unforgivable; I really do. Why would somebody not support the Andrews bill? The committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill removes the power under the Self-Government Acts of the three Territories to enact laws:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">which permit or have the effect of permitting (whether subject to conditions or not) the form of intentional killing of another called euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why would I stand in this place and not support a bill that contains those words? I should. Indeed, that was part of my dilemma before the committee debated the bill. I do not support the intentional killing of another human being. I do not support capital punishment and I certainly will oppose, in my state of Western Australia, any moves by the current government to reintroduce capital punishment there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why would I not support Mr Andrews's bill? When it comes to the vote, I will not support the bill. The simple reason I will not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support the bill is that I do not believe the act of parliament that is in operation in the Northern Territory does give an individual the right to intentionally kill another human being. I do not believe that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that Bob Dent was killed by another human being. I do not believe that Janet Mills was killed by another human being, intentionally or non&hyphen;intentionally. I accept the fact that they made their own decisions. How do I know that? I never met Bob Dent. I never met Janet Mills. I have not met any of their family members, to the best of my knowledge. I have not met the two other individuals who have also taken advantage of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act to end their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have had the opportunity to read the last words of Bob Dent and Janet Mills. The additional comment that I and Senator Bolkus attached to the committee report included the words of Bob Dent and Janet Mills. They are worth repeating here yet again tonight. I will only repeat them in part. After describing in detail the suffering that Bob Dent had endured in the latter years of his life, he composed a letter that he was unable to write himself. He dictated it to his wife. One can imagine the trauma that both of them were going through at the time that this last letter of Bob Dent was being written. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own pain and suffering is made worse by watching my wife suffering as she cares for me: bathing and drying me, cleaning up after my "accidents" in the middle of the night and watching my body fade away. If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always been an active, outgoing person, and being unable to live a normal life causes much mental and psychological pain, which can never be relieved by medication.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Dent also made a plea about palliative care, which we quote in the report, saying he did not want any more. He also made the comment that he could not be hugged by his wife. Any of us who are in a relationship like that will know how important that is. He could not&mdash;in his last hours, days and weeks&mdash;allow his wife to get that close to him because his bones might have broken. So 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1877"> he took advantage of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Dent came along to the public forum that Senator Tambling and Senator Collins arranged on the night before our public hearings in Darwin. On behalf of Mrs Mills's husband, she read to the audience a letter from Mrs Mills. I will quote a part of that as well. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that euthanasia is the greatest thing for people who are sick with no chance of getting better. It's a wonderful idea and it stops people from suffering when they don't need to. Nobody wants to die if they don't have to, but I know I have had no hesitation in asking for this. No one should have to suffer . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are her words, not mine. The letter was dated 1 January 1997, just a few weeks before the committee took the evidence in Darwin. They were moving words and they certainly had an impact on me, as did the words which I have quoted previously from Bob Dent. Those two individuals, despite the pain and the suffering they went through, were very lucky human beings because they were able at the end of their lives to have some say in how they left this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the bill itself and deal with some of the terminology included in it. I quoted from part of it before:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the form of intentional killing of another called euthanasia (which includes mercy killing) or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If one looks around for the definition of `euthanasia', one does not find a definition that says `intentionally killing another human being'. There are a number of definitions and the committee looked at these as we progressed. On page xi in our report, we come up with these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Literally, "euthanasia" refers to a good death or a gentle and easy death. However, euthanasia and related terms have come to mean different things to different people. This was reflected in the variety of ways the terms were used in submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Parliamentary Research Service in a series of papers on euthanasia considers that "euthanasia" can be divided into four categories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It enumerated them and I will not read all the details. They are `active voluntary euthanasia', `passive voluntary euthanasia', `passive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in/non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia' and `active in/non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it strange, when you have words like these around, that Mr Andrews did not seek to use them in his bill? Why would Mr Andrews put the term `intentionally killing' into a bill when there were much calmer, more soothing words available to him? I do not know. I have suspicions, but I am not going to cast aspersions on a member of another place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got a number of other letters, as we all have, on this matter. There is one other that I want to refer to. It is similar in style to the one I read earlier. Again, I will not name the individual. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you to ask you to vote for the Andrews Bill. I am opposed to Euthanasia, as it is using killing to solve a social problem. What is needed instead is a good palliative care program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Palliative care and the delivery of palliative care services was not a reference of the committee. It was not one on which we sought to gather and gain information but, nonetheless, it came through in a steady stream of the submissions how important palliative care was. A deal of criticism was given about the lack of adequate palliative care services in the Northern Territory and other parts of Australia. International organisations of palliative care came to the committee in Canberra and gave evidence to us. Doctor Michael Smith, the President of the Australian Association of Hospice and Palliative Care told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been recognised in the soon to be released report of the palliative care program review 1996, the development of palliative care services across Australia is now at a critical stage, as it is still incomplete. For palliative care services to mature and be funded as a mainstream health service, a number of milestones are yet to be achieved. In this difficult time, the Commonwealth has reduced its funding of palliative care for 1996&hyphen;97 by 10 per cent, in the name of administrative efficiency. In the absence of agreed administrative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states, this cut has simply meant less Commonwealth money for patient care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of the specific Commonwealth palliative care funding program, PCP, is uncertain, as it is due for completion in July 1997, with no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1878"> evidence of Commonwealth commitment to its continuance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It would be worthwhile for senators to perhaps stay their vote on this bill until we know what is going to be delivered in the Commonwealth budget on 13 May. Are there going to be further cuts to palliative care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One final matter I want to mention is evidence we received in the Northern Territory from Mr Marshall Perron, as stated to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have never died so slowly and, for a very few, we have never died so agonisingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Perron provided the committee with a list that came from the Australian Bureau of Statistics of suicides by Australians 75 years and older in the five&hyphen;year period between 1990 and 1994. It detailed the deaths of 672 people. Others have talked about youth suicide but we perhaps ought to have a special debate and forum in the parliament to look at the horrific means by which many&mdash;a darned sight more than four&mdash;of the elder citizens and residents of this country are leaving this world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the time we finally vote on the Euthanasia Laws Bill the arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia will have been thoroughly canvassed. This bill has little to do with euthanasia and is much more about the federal parliament seeking to override the sovereign jurisdictions of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island&mdash;relegating the residents of these territories to the status of second&hyphen;class citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than revisit the various arguments for and against euthanasia, I intend addressing five fundamental issues I feel will better inform the Senate about the gravity of the bill currently before us and its consequences. Firstly, what did Marshall Perron, the architect of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of 1995, set out to achieve? The Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act totals fifteen pages. It is compulsory and essential reading for any senator intending to vote on the Andrews bill. It is this act, already passed by a democrati 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cally elected parliament, that the Senate is essentially in the process of scrutinising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the original rights of the terminally ill legislation passed through the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly 15 votes to 10 at the all important third reading. In his speech introducing the original bill in the Northern Territory parliament, Marshall Perron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a political issue, it is a human rights issue. I began preparing this bill following searching thought about the rights of those who face a distressing, undignified and possibly painful death and the dilemma confronting them and their medical advisers on the question of whether or not to actively terminate life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite obviously, Marshall Perron set out to provide the option of voluntary euthanasia for a very small number of people who have a terminal illness and who meet the strict requirements and safeguards of a particular piece of legislation. This intention is also reflected in the first paragraph of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An act to confirm the right of a terminally ill person to request assistance from a medically qualified person to voluntarily terminate his or her life in a humane manner; to allow for such assistance to be given in certain circumstances without legal impediment to the person rendering the assistance; to provide procedural protection against the possibility of abuse of the rights recognised by this act; and for related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Northern Territory act is based on the principle of personal choice&mdash;debunking the myth that the terms of the legislation will somehow be accessed on an involuntary basis. Surely in today's sophisticated society we can confidently face the responsibility of end of life decisions in extenuating circumstances with our families, medical advisers and spiritual friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supporters of the Andrews bill will have us believe that the Northern Territory legislation is too loose and too open to abuse. You be the judge of that. In my opinion, this is a well crafted piece of legislation, having been very properly shaped by the Northern Territory's own select committee&mdash;which honestly gave a much more comprehensive study than our own, which was a very good report as well&mdash;and the subsequent parliamentary debate and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1879"> amendment. The territory legislation has also survived a number of attempts at repeal and a Supreme Court challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory act contains a defined series of important safeguards and established bona fides which were recently bolstered by the successful passage of an amendment bill. As the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report rightly acknowledged in discussing the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, the question of finetuning the act is a matter for the Northern Territory parliament alone. The committee recognised the very important role constitutional convention plays in the administration of the federal system of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the committee did not acknowledge the next logical step&mdash;and most pertinent to this debate&mdash;that any repeal or termination of this legislation rests solely within the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory parliament. Why  would the committee very properly acknowledge that the federal parliament has no place amending Northern Territory legislation and yet propose to ride roughshod over the Northern Territory parliament and remove a whole range of legislative powers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to remember that Marshall Perron, whilst pioneering voluntary euthanasia for Australia, was not the first to do so internationally. The practices in Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United States of America also contribute to the timeliness and acceptability of the debate. Marshall Perron and his territory colleagues picked up the concepts and contemporary relevance and were not afraid to face the expectations so transparent in the community. Too many supporters in the House of Representatives and in the Senate face the debate with fear, with pessimism or with a dogged reliance on the intellectual bribes of vested interest groups. Marshal Perron's examples and actions highlight for us the fact that we live today in a secular, multicultural society and not a church state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, what has the member for Menzies, Kevin Andrews, done? A provision exists in the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act of 1978 which allows the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> federal government to disallow legislation generated by the Northern Territory parliament within six months of the date the Northern Territory legislation receives the Administrator's assent. This action was not proposed or initiated in federal parliament. Therefore, the opportunity for the member for Menzies, Kevin Andrews, and like&hyphen;minded federal parliamentarians to effectively interfere with the Northern Territory parliamentary process has lapsed. In fact, the idea was squashed by the then Keating Labor government on principle. It is this issue that certainly now rankles Territorians with so many Liberal and National friends adopting what can only be seen as a hypocritical and pious attitude on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, nearly two years after the Northern Territory parliament very properly enacted the rights of the terminally ill legislation, we are presented with a torpedo style private member's bill. The Andrews bill is short-sighted, paternalistic and patronising in the extreme. The Commonwealth Attorney-General's office agrees, conceding that the impact of the bill on existing legislation such as the Northern Territory's Natural Death Act and Criminal Code is unknown and will require a series of test court cases to be heard before the precise impact of the Andrews bill is known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the arguments in the House of Representatives and the Senate have relied on extremely personal and theological positions of those arguing along with Mr Andrews on issues of legalising morality and spirituality. A number of church leaders presented similar views to the Senate committee. As a Christian myself, I find this argument disrespectful in recognising the diversity of the cultural interests of the community in which we live. I have certainly searched my own soul throughout the past two years on this issue and I cannot find any scriptural condemnation of anyone who chooses to take their own life. In fact, the respect for the dignity of the individual is supported in all of my studies, and I believe too many of my fellow Christians rely on their own judgments rather than those of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> and Jesus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, is there a constitutional principle at stake? There surely is. All state premiers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1880"> supported the territory's view that the Commonwealth should not legislate on this issue at their leaders forum on 27 September 1996. I remind the Senate that the Northern Territory parliament presented a unanimous remonstrance to this parliament on 27 October 1996. This was not done lightly. The Senate's own Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills observed of the Andrews bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth parliament, while undoubtedly having the power to pass the bill, would, by so doing, create a situation where some Australians are treated in a way different from other citizens because it curtails their present right to self-government in circumstances where, were they live to in the states, it could not do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, if passed, would override the decision of the democratically elected government of the Northern Territory when it appears that there would be no head of power or international convention by which it could override the same or similar legislation enacted by the states.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not have a problem with this parliament investigating, debating and legislating on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, as long as it is on a national basis and it is consistent with the existing federal convention of division of responsibility between the tiers of government. I believe addressing such issues as euthanasia is a sign of a mature community able to confidently and competently broach relevant issues of the day. My objection is to this federal parliament legislating in a jurisdiction where clearly we have no place and on social issues properly the prerogative of the states and self-governing territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As my colleague in the House of Representatives, Nick Dondas, pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate on this bill, the dispatch boxes and the mace in the Northern Territory parliament were originally a gift from the federal parliament to the Northern Territory when self-government was attained. Why now would some self-righteous federal parliamentarians attempt to bastardise the Westminster system and overturn centuries of constitutional convention? As Mr Dondas noted, the presentation of the mace in particular signified the personal approval by Her Majesty the Queen for the Northern Territory parliament to make laws within its constitu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tional power and according to the collective conscience of the parliament for the wellbeing of the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly attracted to the motions of Mr Sinclair in the House of Representatives and my fellow Northern Territory senator, Senator Bob Collins, seeking to refer the matter raised by the Andrews bill to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice for legislation to be drafted which will apply on a national basis. Surely, legislation applying to the whole of Australia would serve the interests of Mr Andrews and his supporters a great deal better than legislation pragmatically targeted at three territories for the sole purpose of convenience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal parliamentarians have underestimated the strength of conviction of Northern Territory residents on the issue of the federal parliament overriding the democratically elected Northern Territory parliament. I am sure senators present at the January public forum in Darwin of over 450 people will recall a number of Northern Territory residents expressing their disdain for this parliament's intention to undermine the Northern Territory parliament. A constitutional principle is at stake. The Andrews bill does not recognise the significance of Northern Territory self&hyphen;government, which established a self-governing body politic on the traditional democratic Westminster model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory is treated as a state for all funding, administrative and federal relations purposes. The record of Northern Territory economic, social and political development since 1978 is unparalleled anywhere else in Australia. Therefore, it is not surprising to learn that, in the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department, any retraction of the grant of self&hyphen;government is unthinkable, except in the instance of civil breakdown. I endorse that view. In my lifelong experience as a territorian, I cannot recall any circumstances that required draconian federal intervention such as that now proposed&mdash;and we certainly do not have civil breakdown in the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, can we acknowledge areas for further action? Yes, we can. The debate on voluntary euthanasia naturally attracts atten 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1881"> tion to 101 other associated issues. Many of them have an essential health focus. Many of them impinge on the issues of family responsibility and caring. Importantly, we cannot ignore palliative care. Under no circumstances do I want to deny the priority of these issues in our daily lives or their relevance to government policy and public administration. By scratching the surface of problems and challenges in health, family and aged care, we will reveal problems galore, but let us not get drawn by distractions from the real issue in this debate&mdash;how we handle dignified dying for the terminally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far too often, we are aware that the rich and connected can access euthanasia by deals and arrangements with their doctors. Not only is this immoral and illegal, but it also highlights the tragic fact that equity does not exist for terminally ill people who are not rich and connected. I acknowledge that palliative care is inadequate. Thankfully, this two&hyphen;year debate and my family experiences have focused me on accepting an involvement I had not previously accepted. We all can and should do more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Living in northern Australia, with its unique lifestyle and proximity to Asia, has made all territorians aware that our neighbouring Asian countries provide us with intimate examples of close&hyphen;knit family networks whose members accept responsibility for the care of the aged and ill. Again, I say we all can and should do more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A close assessment of the impact of voluntary euthanasia on the Aboriginal community is essential. Submissions came to the Senate committee from far and wide and, in my opinion, were both good and bad. There were genuine concerns expressed about health care practices and availability, raising the need for attention by community leaders and health care providers. At the same time, it is all too easy to be drawn into a fanciful world of sorcery and supernatural poppycock by people with strange agendas who, for political reasons, would return many Aboriginal people to feudal times. In trying to do so, they damn far too many Aboriginal people to awful public health standards and shocking life expectancies. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only through delivering 20th century health care, technology and advanced education will the issues in Aboriginal communities be properly addressed. We certainly have a responsibility to fully explain voluntary euthanasia and palliative care and to not get caught up in patronising Aboriginal communities by coddling them in cultural protectionism rather than dealing with the fundamental issue of dying and the need to involve through education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government should be complimented on the innovative approach it has taken to Aboriginal health care. High expenditure commitments have been developed for effective living with alcohol programs, remedial attention to the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and improving ghastly public hygiene&mdash;all with outstanding results. It is mischievous to imply that voluntary euthanasia will set back these necessary advances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, and finally, what is a true `conscience' vote? I am aware that all senators have wrestled with this legislation, and it is apparent from their comments that many senators are torn between their personal emotions and opinions, the constitutional and legal controversy over just who has the legislative prerogative, and the clear views of a majority of ordinary Australians in their electorates who obviously support voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the second reading vote will test us all, without any party or special disciplines. This is clearly an unprecedented debate where senators cross party lines and make many strange alliances. In the House of Representatives, manipulative forces played a large role in determining many votes in marginal seats. Thankfully, the Senate can stand aside and exercise what is truly a conscience vote. I go one step further and suggest to those of my colleagues who cannot reconcile their personal values with competing public interests that it is just as appropriate for a senator to abstain, after having stated those views, as it is to exercise a deliberative vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drawing my comments to a close, I challenge the Senate to return to the funda 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1882"> mental principle of why voluntary euthanasia is considered by a majority of Australians to be an appropriate option. Carol Atkinson, the last of 51 speakers at the public forum in Darwin in January, hosted by Senator Bob Collins and me, gave us all an outstanding summary. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been in a position of being a registered nurse in an oncology and haematology unit where many people have died. Of those people, what I learnt was that some would have chosen to exercise their choice through this bill; others would not have. That did not mean that not all of them suffered. They all did. With the decisions in their death, the way they faced up to it, all of those people were very active in their death. However, those who would have been able to choose to take this opportunity and use this bill are being incredibly active; they are not running away from their decisions about their death. They would have made that choice in what was at that stage a very high quality palliative care situation. I don't know what decision I would make in their situation; what I would like to see is that I would have that choice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These sentiments and the totally unconstitutional, undemocratic and discriminatory thrust of the Euthanasia Laws Bill make it imperative that we in the Senate recognise reason, commonsense, humaneness and constitutional support for the Northern Territory's legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1882" TIME="8.08 p.m." SPEAKER="Bourne, Sen Vicki" NAMEID="TW4" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.08 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This euthanasia legislation has obviously attracted a great deal of interest not only in the Northern Territory but throughout Australia. I have had literally thousands of letters from people who believe very strongly and very strenuously and very passionately in both sides of this debate. It has been very interesting to listen to the debate so far in the Senate because we have found people, perhaps whom we would not have expected to, believing very passionately, strongly and strenuously in both sides of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when it comes down to how I intend to vote on this, it will be according to two basic principles. The first of those is the basic human right to your own life. You have a basic right; it is given to you for your own life. The military junta cannot roll up to your door and take you away and kill you. Nobody can take you away and kill you in Australia. But you have the right&mdash;and you ought to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the right to your own life&mdash;to make decisions about your own life and when it will end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second principle is the right of the Northern Territory government to enact its own legislation. We have just heard a very passionate speech from Senator Tambling&mdash;and I must agree with him&mdash;that it is a really outrageous step for this parliament to take to override a piece of Northern Territory legislation. The Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Act is not about suicide. It is about the right of a person who has a terminal illness&mdash;the illness has to be terminal and they have to be going to die from it&mdash;and who is experiencing pain, suffering and distress to an unacceptable level deciding when they wish to end that extreme pain and suffering while maintaining their own dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a great supporter of palliative care. We have some excellent hospices and palliative care units in Australia and I think we should be funding them to a far greater extent than we are. We should be encouraging them in their excellent work. I visited a hospice myself a few years ago when a friend of mine was dying of AIDS. That visit was a very difficult thing to do, mostly because the friend was dying of AIDS in the hospice. But the hospice was a very warm, friendly and, to the extent that it could be, delightful place. He really enjoyed being there. It was far better than having been in an ordinary hospital or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not choose, and I do not think he would have chosen, to end his life before his life ended itself. But I believed then, and I believe now, that he should have had the right to make that decision if had wished to. He should have had the right when that pain and suffering became too great&mdash;and the pain and suffering does become very, very great&mdash;to decide for himself, `Okay, that is it.' We have to acknowledge that there may come a time, even with the best palliative care, when a person may decide they just cannot take any more. When that time comes, I believe that person should have the right to decide to let go and to end their own pain and their suffering with grace and with dignity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1883">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a great deal about how doctors already assist such patients to die at the right time. The thing I find offensive about that is the assumption that a doctor will know better than the patient when the pain and suffering and distress of the patient have become too much for them. The idea that the doctor has a natural right to know when a patient should end their life but the patient does not is something I cannot agree with. It is already happening, but it is happening at the will of the doctor and not of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second principle that I mention, and I am very conscious of it in this debate, is the autonomy of the Northern Territory parliament and its right to enact laws which have effect in the Northern Territory. We have heard about the angst and the soul&hyphen;searching that the Northern Territory parliament went through before it finally passed this act. We have heard about all the studies that they went through, about how much they deliberated and how much they had to go through before this happened. Now we are considering, in Canberra, whether we will allow them to keep that act. What will be the next act of the Northern Territory parliament to be challenged? What about ACT legislation? Should we let them? Are they old enough and big enough to make their own legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found yesterday's debate on this bill to be far more interesting than I had expected. I thought Senator Vanstone made a particularly interesting point that this was not an election issue, that this had not come up during the election and that the people of Australia had not voted in their representatives on any basis of how they would vote on a bill to override an act of the Northern Territory. That act of the Northern Territory was in before the election, and the people of Australia should have had the opportunity to comment if anyone was going to bring this bill up and was going to try to push it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting point, of course, is that this bill is a private member's bill. I have raised several private member's bills myself. I think they are just as important as this and I think they are just as vital to the health of the nation as this. There is no way on the face of this earth that they will get the same 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> imprimatur from the government as this bill has done. That is a very important and very interesting point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that Senator Vanstone made was a very important and interesting one. In all the studies where we have asked the people of Australia about how they feel about this, whether they believe that euthanasia should be legal under these circumstances&mdash;these incredibly strict circumstances in this bill&mdash;about 75 per cent of them said yes. So I wonder who is representing their constituencies here, In fact, most of us do not really know if we are on this, I suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, allusions were made which were quite unnecessary and thoroughly offensive. I wish to goodness that all of us in this parliament would stop alluding to Nazi Germany. I find it offensive whenever it is used. It is always over the top. It is not something we should ever do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many people who lived through the Nazi period in Germany are still alive in Australia and find it incredibly offensive when somebody mentions Nazi Germany and then says that somebody in Australia reminds them of that. Invariably, the person whom they say reminds them of it bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the appalling things that happened at that time. We all should take that one right out of our lexicons and never use it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me say that the way I intend to vote on this legislation is the way that I hope others would vote. I strongly believe, and always have throughout my life, that you do unto others as you would have them do unto you. What I would have others do unto me, if I were in the situation described in the bill, is to allow me the right, when I felt that I could not go on, to decide that with dignity and grace it is time to stop. I would like that right for myself, for others and for anyone I love. I intend to vote, first, to enable others to have that right and, second, to make sure that we do not override an act of a popularly, democratically elected parliament of one of the territories of this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Andrews bill. I do so on the basis of moral, social and ethical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1884"> values. I declare at the outset, as I have in the media, that I am a Christian and I hold Christian values. I will also declare, so people who are listening to this broadcast will know, that I am one of the 13 senators who signed the advice to the Senate in support of the Andrews bill, from pages 115 to 130. So my position in that respect is clearly well known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to thank all those people who wrote letters to me or sent me faxes from both sides of the argument. While one might presume that I have a predisposition, I did read the arguments that were put forward with interest, and let me say that my views are my personal views; I am not influenced by anyone or any outside sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to canvass all the issues that have been raised in this debate so far, but there are a number I want to concentrate on and a number that I want to answer in a very simple way without demeaning the force of argument behind them, so that I can get on to the main thrust of what I wish to talk about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak first on the issue of the rights of the Northern Territory to legislate and the issue of states rights generally. In my view, it stopped being a territory issue when people crossed the border to take up the offer of euthanasia. That is when it stopped being something that was isolated to or insulated in the Northern Territory. In that case, I see it affecting other states and other people within the confines of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constitutionality issue is covered very well in the report, so I am not going to canvass that at length, suffice to say that I believe the Andrews bill is properly before the Senate. I, as a member of this Senate, believe that I have a legitimate right to express an opinion on this bill and to vote on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also heard canvassed the idea that we should have had a referendum on the issue. I want to address that very briefly. Whilst this is nice in theory, I believe that we do have a bill properly before this parliament and we do have a parliament that is elected by the people. Whether that parliament was elected by the people to consider this particular issue is not at stake as far as I am concerned. The parliament is elected to govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and must confront all issues that come before it. The idea of a proletariat democracy is, to me, a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if there were to be a debate, because euthanasia means to different people a wide range of things, one would have a great deal of trouble conducting an informed referendum on the issue. I believe it would be an impossibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of polls, I want to make this very brief comment: tell me the result that you want and I will frame the question. I have been involved in numerous things over the years where people have conjured up the result that they want and have then written the question to suit the result. I am not saying that some people have done that on this occasion, but that is always the danger with polls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to some of the more substantive things. I believe that every life has a value. I also believe that life is an experience. We experience joy, we experience sadness, we experience warmth and chill, we experience success, we experience failure, we experience pain and we experience relief. Life is not perfect, and the experience of life shapes us as individuals. It makes us what we are. It shapes those around us as well. So to me, life is an ongoing process that has effect not only internally but also externally. I concede that death itself is not an easy process but I believe it is a part of life. I believe that truncating the process of dying is denying an experience of life for both the person dying and those surrounding them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been through the death of my parents. I have suffered and experienced their pain, their anguish. Both of my parents died of cancer. In one case it was not a lengthy period, in the other case it was a matter of some weeks. Yes, I am human. Yes, I do feel. Yes, I did feel it was a difficult time for me, my sister and my wife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, I did feel. I am not an inhuman sort of person but in no way did I not get value from that experience. Whilst I experienced sadness, I also experienced how to cope with life. I think that is important to everyone in the dying process. People who do not experience the dying process because they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1885"> remote from their loved one who dies miss out on something. I feel that is very important in this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I must say that I am against capital punishment. I believe that just as capital punishment is wrong because it is the state exercising its authority to take away someone's life so too is euthanasia. That is my view. Euthanasia has the problem compounded by divesting the authority or the power to a third party, namely, the doctors. Like everyone, doctors are fallible. The euthanasia argument puts for them a position of power that no other individual or group in our community has conferred upon them. There are no safeguards or supervision where euthanasia is involved, other than the three doctors being in agreement. The twist in all of this is that no&hyphen;one is certain when death will ensue anyway. How does one really know that someone has a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, 10 months or whatever it might be to live? No&hyphen;one can tell me when life is going to end. The unfortunate part&mdash;and this is not meant to be facetious&mdash;is that death cannot be undone. It is final. That is why&mdash;whether it be capital punishment or euthanasia&mdash;I am fundamentally opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical problem for me&mdash;and those who know me know I am a practical person&mdash;is the slippery slope. Whilst that has stood some criticism in this debate, I cannot be convinced that we will not go from voluntary euthanasia to involuntary euthanasia because no&hyphen;one&mdash;and it does not matter who they are&mdash;can give me a guarantee that this will not happen. No doubt there are supremacists or purists in our society who like to see everything in a perfect or pristine state. In the longer term, they will use the ongoing existence of a euthanasia act to turn their attention to the disabled, the suicidal, those in prolonged pain, those who have had enough of life and those who may feel worthless; in other words, people who are vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe every individual has worth. That worth cannot be dismissed by those in positions of power or privilege. As I have said, no&hyphen;one can give me an ironclad guarantee that voluntary euthanasia will not ultimately become involuntary as we become inured, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hardened by the fact that people are able to have their lives terminated, albeit at their own request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that life is the cornerstone of civilisation and tampering with it is unacceptable. Basically, I cannot see any justification for why we would head down this path of euthanasia. One of the arguments which has come out in this debate has been the argument about pain, the suffering of people. That has moved me a great deal. I know someone who suffers great pain and the rigours of huge amounts of medication on a daily basis. That person, Lyn Doring, happens to be a cousin of my wife. Lyn is about my age. I will not give any secrets away, but I am nearer to 50 than anything else. Lyn suffered a tragic car accident back in 1967. Her qualifications are Bachelor of Physiotherapy in 1971, getting first class honours in 1975, Bachelor of Medical Science in 1978 and she was heading down the path to becoming a doctor. However, the tragedy of her accident stopped her and prevented her from going any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From her experience of suffering pain over a long period, Lyn has put together a number of papers on pain and the ability to cope with pain. I have two of her papers which I am going to quote from in the time I have left because her words say it much better than I could ever say. In the first paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Go Forth with Joy</EMPHASIS> she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My main problem is pain. Sensory and motor deficits were comparatively easy to manage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was in the early 1980s. She goes on in the same paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1979 I have been totally disabled by pain. My condition has proved to be progressive and degenerative. We investigated every avenue, all to no avail.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This led her down the path of looking at the power play involved in pain. This is the thing that concerns me, that there is a power play by those who are in a position of power as opposed to the patient who is generally in a position where they are powerless or feel powerless. I will quote selectively, but if anyone wants to read the full articles, I will supply both of them so that they can test their veracity. As I go through, I will read the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1886"> quotes and make brief comments. She talks about power play and goes on:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The totality of each person's paradigms may be termed the assumptive world (Frank 1974). This is a highly structured, complex, interacting set of values, expectations and images of self and others.

<PARA STYLE="Para">She is talking about the assumptive state. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within an individual's assumptive world, physical and psychological aspects are meshed. Loss of control of the physical body has a profound psychological effect and is associated with a loss of self&hyphen;esteem and a sense of being powerless to control events.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is my worry in the euthanasia debate&mdash;that people find themselves so placed. Reading on, she says:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pain is isolating, as is any disability. When courage diminishes, patients might appear to withdraw. Within the patient's assumptive world it may be an indrawing, a self&hyphen;encapsulation, in order to contend with external difficulties with apparent poise. In this situation, if a carer is perceived to have disproportionate power, the dynamics of the relationship are affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from a person who suffered for a substantial part of her life. I believe she has a great understanding. She goes on:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often assumed that people can do anything if they really try, but this is not always so. Disabled persons may be thwarted in their efforts to promote self recovery simply through determination and this can lead to guilt and puzzlement when they find

In the midst of the fray, patients may become fugitives from their own bodies&mdash;refugees from suffering who have nowhere to go. Their assumptive worlds have not hitherto needed to deal with this extremity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the problem that people are faced with when they are faced with pain. She goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from someone who experiences; someone who knows pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fear is that people like Lyn Doring will be, in the longer term, the advocates of euthanasia. Whilst those supporting voluntary euthanasia might very genuinely and sincerely say this is not their intention today, they cannot give an ironclad guarantee that today's legislation will not lead to more dire interpretations later on. So whilst there is not a slippery slope for some people today, no-one can give me a guarantee that there will not be a slippery slope further down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to end with a few brief quotes from Lyn Doring, a person who suffers pain daily. This is her attitude to life in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Go Forth With Joy</EMPHASIS>. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Even disabled, I can pursue excellence. There is no impediment to my pursuit of beauty, truth, goodness and loving kindness.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is referring to her illness. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not blame them, but that does not solve the wounds of loss and grief.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is one of the things that I think is fundamental in the debate that is going on here 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1887"> about euthanasia. As I said, life is an experience. It is a difficult experience. Not everything is perfect, and we have to face up to the good and the bad. In facing up to that, courage is, on many occasions, required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I would like to briefly remark that I believe there is a greater need for more palliative care. It will make the process of dying easier, and it should not remove the emotional side for the patient or the loved ones. I am concerned about the Aboriginals and what was in the report. Last but not least, I am not convinced that, when people have an understanding of the full range of issues involved in the euthanasia debate, there is any justification for supporting euthanasia. I support the Andrews bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout this debate I have deliberated on the many issues put before me on euthanasia. I have taken account of the position of those who are suffering painful terminal illness and disease. I have read hundreds of letters from ordinary concerned citizens, as well as individuals from the legal and medical professions, hospices, hospitals, various denominations of the clergy, the Aboriginal community and a range of community organisations seeking my support for their particular view. Over this time I have come to understand both sides of the debate, and I have taken into account the considerations provided by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its recent report on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering this question, I looked towards a definition of euthanasia. I know that, historically, `euthanasia', in the original Greek sense of the word, was defined from the word `euthanatos'&mdash;`eu' meaning good and `thanatos' meaning death. Hence, the earliest usage of the word was meant to convey a gentle, good or easy death. This may, to some, seem an absurd concept, but, in the context of human life, most would hope for a good death&mdash;one that deals with the effects of the physical illness and suffering of dying, one which addresses the sadness, fear and anger which may be experienced and one which nurtures and gives comfort and support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no way did this term mean to include committing an act to directly effect or to cause the direct death of a person. But today the term `euthanasia' has become a controversial topic. Not even the definition of the term can be agreed upon, with arguments on classification and category types being devised to differentiate between the types and deaths which could be incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four main categories which seem to have been accepted into this debate have included active voluntary euthanasia, passive voluntary euthanasia, active involuntary euthanasia and passive non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia. However, all these classifications seem to stem from a precept of allowing human intervention which would end a patient's life. They all seem to involve the concept of intentional killing with or without the patient's consent. As such, I could never sanction any form of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be clear in my belief of what euthanasia is not. It is not the withdrawal or the withholding of medical treatment which is futile, unwanted or burdensome. Nor is it euthanasia to provide sufficient pain relief to a patient, even if that treatment may hasten death by a short time. However, euthanasia is and involves the intentional causing of death to a person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, it has become quite evident throughout this debate that those who argue to legalise euthanasia would also seek to muddy the waters on the definition of what constitutes euthanasia on the basis of what is intended and what is foreseeable. They have tried to infer that the legitimate withdrawal of futile medical treatment or the provision of pain medication, which may as a consequence shorten a person's life, is somehow a party to concepts of euthanasia, which it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the terms of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, euthanasia is described as the deliberate intervention by the medical profession to assist a terminally ill person who meets a range of predefined criteria to end their life. This act also seeks to regulate the law, as we have seen it applied in criminal law, and to intervene in the application of the coroners act by limiting the jurisdiction of the coroner in the investigation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1888"> of a death occurring within the provision of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point of fact, the act serves to support assisted suicide&mdash;assisting to bring about the deliberate death of another human being. In the terms of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act there can be no doubt that euthanasia is the wilful death, albeit killing, of a human being. It lies somewhere between homicide and suicide, where the actual death is carried out by the patient with the sanction and support of secondary parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to concur with the views put forward in the House of the Commons debate on euthanasia in 1970 by Mr Norman St John Stevas where he reasoned that a doctor, no matter what his views, had a duty to preserve life. He argued that this duty was the basis of the patient&hyphen;doctor relationship. Though he said this did not mean that life was to be prolonged at any cost, he reasoned that there was clearly a moral distinction between giving a pain killing drug knowing it may or will shorten life and giving a drug with the direct intention to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also noticed that a dichotomy of values, beliefs and ideas has been running through this debate. But this split which has occurred on many levels and aspects of the debate&mdash;that is, in terms of state&hyphen;territory rights versus Commonwealth rights, the definition of euthanasia and even what constitutes a conscience vote&mdash;is not the heart of the matter. The crux lies in the long&hyphen;term implications of this law and the value we place on human life. I emphasise life because it is life, and our ability to protect and maintain human life, which underpins our very existence. All our efforts this century in particular and throughout history have been driven by our ability to protect and sustain life. Our very humanity is based on this precept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To devise methods of killing and then cloak them in the veil of law works against all that humankind has worked and suffered for. Has life become so mechanical, so routine, so easily replicated&mdash;especially now that science has demonstrated the ability to clone&mdash;that we now place less value on life that exists? Have we come so far that we are now ready to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> establish sterile clinical dormitories, death rooms, which will be fully equipped to take away the lives of our people, the very people who are in need of support, by using a law of government sanctioning their death? Have we come so far that we are willing to agree which lives are expendable? What morals, what values, what philosophy do we lean upon to make this decision? How do we show our children that human life is a mystery in itself when we put in place laws that clearly show that life is expendable and replaceable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will we manage to stop youth suicide in this nation if we give our youth dual messages about the value of life and the struggle to go on when it seems all hope has gone? Does not the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act sanction death&mdash;that is, all you need is a reason which can demonstrate futility&mdash;or is a perception of futility when support no longer exists? No. Just as we clearly know that we must support our youth through their despair, pain and sense of hopelessness, we must also provide support for our chronically ill, terminally ill and fellow human beings who are suffering long&hyphen;term chronic pain and disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a cry for euthanasia is a cry for help, but who has heard the real cry? Instead, we debate the merits of medically assisted induced death. Rather than meet this cry with a death warrant, we must ensure that effective palliative care programs are put in place. We will truly be a compassionate nation when we turn our minds and medical science focus towards mechanisms which offer real and effective pain management and holistic care in death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned that with the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act we have government sanctioned suicide with limited coronial review and it will become, in time, less and less clear or provable that a death has occurred without possible provocation, collusion or insidious manipulation of the patient's physical, emotional and psychological condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the Northern Territory act relates to individuals suffering a terminal illness. But in our Aboriginal communities it has been made clear that there are illnesses 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1889"> and diseases which, for this population, are terminal but for the wider community have been eliminated as a serious threat of death. By adopting the act do we justify the possibility that many indigenous Australians may become eligible for euthanasia by default of meeting a criteria that many other Australians do not meet? If we adopt euthanasia will our efforts to eliminate these diseases and illnesses in these communities be affected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have many concerns with the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, but in particular with the assessment of mental competence. The act specifies that a qualified psychiatrist must certify that the patient is mentally competent to elect euthanasia. Under the act, as it stands, it would seem that for a psychiatrist to not sign the consent form there would need to be a speedy and genuine diagnosis of mental incompetence directly arising from the medical condition with which the person was diagnosed as terminally ill. This would mean that the psychiatrist would need to undergo a thorough examination and be familiar with the personality of the patient so as to determine the person's true mental health state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns are grave for people subject to this act. For example, take a patient who projects, or seems to demonstrate, outward understanding of the full implication of a request to terminate their life. Has the request been guided by reason and rational calm or has some other factor or factors played a part in the decision making process? What safeguards are in place to ensure this decision is really desired and fully understood? Is there really sufficient opportunity for a person to change their mind, have a change of heart or regain hope? Once the decision is made, as Senator Hogg said, it is final.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there really sufficient time in the assessment phase for a clear evaluation of the patient? Have all the influences been examined such as family attitudes and support; financial position; provision of adequate, effective and appropriate palliative care; pre-existing personality factors; factors directly related to managing pain and the terminal illness; factors arising from treatment processes and/or the quality of care; moral, ethical and social factors pertinent to the patient; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accumulative stress from the illness or other illness existing; and previous medical history? Do other medical conditions contribute to the psychological state? Has, for example, there been a recent bereavement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many questions with regard to how rigorous the psychiatric assessment really is could be posed. However, it would seem that one psychiatric evaluation is hardly sufficient, especially since our courts are filled daily with cases argued and defended on conflicting evaluations and opinions contained in psychiatric reports. Opinions given by psychiatrists and psychologists can be open to interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act places great emphasis on the fact that the patient is making his or her own decision, but how rational are most people during critical incidents or when faced with life threatening or stressful situations such as severe illness, enduring bereavements or during tragedy? Once we have agreed that the terminally ill should be allowed to seek out death, how long would it be before there were `reasons' for the diseased, the long-term ill, the disabled, the aged and all those who find life intolerable and painful either emotionally, psychologically or physically, to also seek death?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we are aware, Australia is part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, coming into effect in 1976 and ratified by Australia in 1980. Article 6 of the covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every Human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While there are no specific international laws which cover euthanasia, there have been numerous inquiries into it. In fact, there have been a number of in&hyphen;depth inquiries into the validity and legal implications of legislating for euthanasia. Of all the bills supporting euthanasia in the United Kingdom over the past 60 years, not one has been successful. Furthermore, the fact that a law or statement at an international, United Nations, level does not exist, only serves to demonstrate that this course of action is not one to pursue. I further 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1890"> believe that the reason euthanasia is not supported at any United Nations level is that the right to life is sanctioned by all United Nations bodies, to which Australia is a party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I do find amazing is the fact that the argument of those who support euthanasia and oppose Commonwealth intervention, either under section 122 of the constitution or on a states rights basis, has been steeped in concepts of self-government. It is ironic that some of the very people who welcomed Commonwealth intervention in the past&mdash;on the Franklin Dam issue and on homosexual human rights issues&mdash;now hope there is no international treaty or covenant to stop Commonwealth intervention on a protection of human life issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we can see, there has been a dichotomy of views, beliefs and ideas running through this entire debate. I firmly believe that the laws of this land must be drafted so as not to cause disadvantage or vulnerability and to ensure that the elderly, the sick and the distressed do not experience pressure, whether real or imagined, to have their life put to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well documented that, when a person expresses a desire to die, it is often out of weariness or depression resulting from a prolonged period of pain or intensive treatment. Sometimes it is because the person feels a burden on the people who care for them or on the family which has given support to them. Sometimes it is because the person no longer feels of value and/or is being told that death would be the best solution. A report on `Clinical issues in euthanasia' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, 3 February 1997, recently highlighted that the:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . importance of families in personal decision&hyphen;making should not be underestimated. Families can, either consciously or unconsciously, influence patients so that they may begin to feel that their life is not worth living.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As such, it is well understood that any change in support for a patient, no matter how subtle, can be a dominant influence in the patient's ability to cope with the illness as well as the pain associated with their condition and their mental wellbeing, including decision making. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It has been reported that the incidence of depression in family support members can be highly correlated with depression occurring in terminally ill patients. Depression, uncontrolled pain and the lack, or failing, of family support can often lead to requests for death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what are the rights of the individual? It has often been cited in this debate that the rights of the individual should be paramount in the consideration of euthanasia, and yet the effects of such a law have implications on each and every person who lives under the flag of this nation. The euthanasia debate cannot be filed into a folder of purely medical or individual concerns. Its implications are ethical, social and legal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In society, as a whole, we have not only rights but also responsibilities to others&mdash;a duty to our neighbour. As such, euthanasia is not a question which lies with the individual alone. This view is supported in findings by the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics in 1994, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one which the interests of the individual cannot be separated from the interests of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With regard to the role of medical practitioners, I have received numerous letters and submissions which have clearly identified ethical, professional and moral concerns in the participation of the medical profession in the deliberate taking of life, especially since their primary task is to preserve and support human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AMA has written to me expressing the view that, `Doctors should not be involved in interventions that have, as their primary goal, the ending of a person's life.' The AMA has also said that while it understands that this view is not necessarily held by all in the medical profession it believes that this divergence can be attributed to many `complex factors, including lack of experience in palliative medicine.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken note of the position of the medical profession on euthanasia throughout the world, which is summarised in a policy by the World Medical Assembly both in 1987 and 1992. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia, that is, the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the patient's own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1891"> request or at the request of close relatives, is unethical. This does not prevent the physician from respecting the desire of the patient to allow the natural processes of death to follow its course in the terminal phase of illness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, this debate is not just about euthanasia but the management of pain in ensuring that there are services available which encompass a range of needs for those who are terminally ill, afflicted with devastating illness and disease or who are suffering intolerably from life&hyphen;enduring or life-ending medical conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I note with concern and some sadness the comments made by Dr Michael Smith, President of the Australian Association of Hospice and Palliative Care, who has indicted that the public fear aroused by this debate has caused uncertainty and concern by patients receiving palliative care&mdash;so much so that patients are now fearful of receiving injected medication. I think that that is a very sad thing that has come out of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to quote something that was referred to by Senator Hogg. It was what he called the slippery slope. I could not help but notice the remarks by Frank Devine in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience in The Netherlands demonstrates that the practice of euthanasia is corrupting and ultimately uncontrollable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would not like to think that as we have become more adept in saving and preserving life we have lost sight of the awe and mystery of life. As a father and husband, and servant of the people in this nation, I have given this matter much consideration and I have asked myself: what value do we place on human life, if it is easier to die than to live? What kind of nation will we be known as if we create laws which act to aid death rather than preserve life? What real compassion can we be seen to have if we do not act to ease pain and suffering, if we do not act to nurture people? What kind of nation will be become? What kind of people will we be? What values, ethics and morals are we teaching our children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I consider the issues and the implications that euthanasia may cause, I am led to the comments of Justice Angel when he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> characterised Wake v. Northern Territory in 1996 as unique and `as one that institutionalised intentional killing which would otherwise be murder; and as one that institutionalised aiding suicide which would otherwise be a crime'. I can find no reason, no matter how emotionally charged, to support any legislation to terminate human life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 dealing with the issue of euthanasia is one of conscience. In other words, there has been no party room decision on the issue which senators have been requested to support. One is free to make one's own decision to support or oppose the legislation, based on the principles one uses to make personal judgments on issues combined with an analysis of the facts relating to the particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of euthanasia has caused divisions in Australia probably not seen since the emotional issue of the abortion debate in the 1970s and 1980s, which similarly polarised many in the community. It therefore goes to the fundamentals of our democratic process and the appropriate role of freedom of speech and freedom of decision by parliamentarians in acting according to their conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of those who have written to me opposing this legislation have argued that my own conscientious view on the issue should not determine how I vote. One argument put is that I should simply support what they claim is the majority view in the community as revealed in public opinion polls. I reject that approach. It means we could dispense with parliament altogether and simply take polls on all decisions required of governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument is that, irrespective of my own views  and indeed of those of others in the community&mdash;even perhaps if those views are in a majority&mdash;they should not be foisted on those who do not share them. I also reject that approach. There are many areas where it is determined to be in the overall interests of the whole community to legislate about a particular issue which in some way impinges on the freedom of some who may disagree with the restriction involved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1892">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Related to this has been the suggestion that my particular values should not be a determining factor in my attitude to this legislation. I also reject that view. I am sure my values and attitudes were a factor in people choosing to elect me to serve in this place and they would expect my values and attitudes to inform my decisions on issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Value&hyphen;free legislation would have the same detrimental consequences on this nation as has so-called value&hyphen;free education. My Christian conviction demands my support for the sanctity of life and does not allow me to accept that a person or people can hasten the end of that life through artificial means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that euthanasia is already being practised in many states and jurisdictions, albeit with subterfuge. Euthanasia rights supporter, Professor Peter Baume, estimated that 7,000 Australian medical practitioners have been party to at least one act of euthanasia. However, this is not a justification for legalisation of the process. In Australia today, no-one is forced to accept or endure unwanted medical intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doctors providing palliative care already administer large doses of pain killing drugs which, while the intent is to relieve pain and bring comfort, may also hasten death. There are those who tell me that it is wrong to prolong the suffering of the terminally ill and dying. This is where palliative care is so important&mdash;ensuring that the person in question is kept as comfortable as possible without either artificially prolonging or intentionally extinguishing life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as we should not by medical intervention hasten death, neither should we by medical intervention prolong life just for the sake of proving that we are medically superior or because we might learn something or because a miracle cure might be just around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with sorrow that I learned of the first medically assisted case of euthanasia in late September. It was with sorrow that I read of the extraordinary tribulations being endured by Rob Dent prior to his decision to end his life, and it was with concern that I learned about the parlous state of available palliative care in the Northern Territory. Since that time 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at least three other people&mdash;one a South Australian woman, Janet Mills, and another unidentified man&mdash;have also availed themselves of the Northern Territory legislation. No&hyphen;one could not have been moved when looking at the ravaged face of Janet Mills and hearing her impassioned plea for a third doctor to sign a piece of paper to put an end to her suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received many hundreds of letters from people across Australia in relation to this debate and they are still coming in. More than 80 per cent give overwhelming support to this legislation, the so&hyphen;called Andrews Bill. We do not have a right to fiddle with the natural process of death and dying, except, as I have said, to ensure the patient is as comfortable as possible until nature takes its proper course. It is possible that Rob Dent would not have taken his final course of action if he had had access to properly funded and staffed palliative care. With regard to Dr Nitschke, the builder of the Northern Territory's death machine, by his own admission he believes he will be referred to as Dr Death, hardly an accolade of honour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion has also been put that the Commonwealth parliament should not intervene in matters before the Northern Territory parliament and that the member for Menzies' bill on voluntary euthanasia is repugnant because it targets and isolates the territory from the rest of Australia. This creates two separate issues&mdash;that of euthanasia and that of the autonomy of democratically elected governments in states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has committed the federal government to facilitating statehood for the Northern Territory but has not yet specified a date. Until such time as that date is set and full statehood is bestowed on the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth government retains responsibility to oversee Northern Territory legislation. Furthermore, this particular piece of Northern Territory legislation does have ramifications for the whole of Australia. Neither Mr Dent nor Mrs Mills were from the Northern Territory. Within days of the legislation taking effect, a terminally ill Broken Hill man travelled to Darwin. His attempt to hasten death was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1893"> thwarted when he could not get the necessary medical assessments. He has since died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of this bill is to repeal that part of the Northern Territory legislation which allows people to deliberately and actively help to cause the death of another. There is the moral and ethical dilemma for medical practitioners, who have pledged under oath not to administer lethal medications. The World Medical Association Declaration on Euthanasia states that the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the patient's request, is unethical. This declaration was adopted by the 39th World Medical Assembly in Spain in 1987 and reiterated in the World Medical Association Statement on Physician Assisted Suicide from the 44th World Medical Assembly in 1992. The Australian Medical Association continues to support both the declaration and the statement, which encourages doctors to respect a patient's autonomy regarding their medical condition and the right to withdraw from treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have the right to refuse burdensome and futile medical treatment, such as refusing chemotherapy or asking that a ventilator be turned off when any chance of recovery is nil. However, I believe that no&hyphen;one has the right to assist a person to bring about an early death. We have a rapidly ageing population and I have a very real fear that people could be the targets of involuntary euthanasia simply because they have passed their `use-by' date. They are simply old and with old age often comes an increased reliance on hospitals and other medical care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Netherlands adopted the practice of euthanasia in 1984. According to a 1990 Dutch government report, upwards of 20 per cent of Holland's annual death statistics are the result of euthanasia, and an average of 14,000 cases of involuntary euthanasia are recorded each year&mdash;that is, deaths that have been asked for by the patient's family and not by the patient themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Menzies argues that euthanasia is `not about helping the dying, it is about disposing of them'. I agree with this assessment. Euthanasia is not the same as withdrawing medical support. It is about consciously administering drugs, usually by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> injection, which kill the recipient. We live in a disposable age&mdash;disposable razors, disposable plates and disposable nappies&mdash;but surely we are not at the stage where we believe in disposable people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legalisation of euthanasia creates a very real possibility of selective culling of Australians. The wide&hyphen;reaching effects are very frightening. It is not just about administering lethal injection to the ill and dying. Indeed, it was suggested to me by a pro&hyphen;euthanasia campaigner, no doubt jocularly, that those who voted for the Andrews bill would be the first euthanased if euthanasia legislation subsequently succeeded. However, what might be a joke today could well become the reality of tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember the joy on the faces of the recently returned and very triumphant paralympians, many with birth handicaps we would consider insurmountable. Should they have been disposed of at birth because they were not perfect or because somebody else made a judgment on their quality of life? Do we allow the young man who has just lost his legs in a car accident to request that he be euthanased, or do we encourage him to believe that there is a future, albeit different from the one he had mapped out for himself prior to his accident? The Netherlands experience highlights the difficulty in ensuring that there are safeguards that ensure the request for euthanasia is a genuinely voluntary one. Are we so naive that we do not believe that some people will act to further their own best interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the argument that people have the right to die with dignity. Everyone of us also has the right to live with dignity. Again, the issue is the availability and quality of palliative care across Australia, not euthanasia. Frail and elderly people, those dying of terminal illnesses and those with handicaps deserve the protection of legislation. They have the same rights as any other member of the community to live with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that it has been suggested to me that euthanasia should be allowed because no person has the right to play God with another person's life. To that I say, no person has the right to play God with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1894"> anyone's life, including their own. Only God has that right. This legislation should be passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try not to take too much of the Senate's time this evening. I would first like to say that I accept that the views of senators and, earlier in the House of Representatives, of members are genuinely held in relation to this matter and, like them, I hold my views and I intend to be true to them. I wanted to start with a quote, which is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Edmund Burke once described a good parliamentarian as one who is responsive to his electorate and able to employ his judgment and his skills for the benefit of his constituents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a few facts that I would like to recite following that. It is a fact that the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill was introduced into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in February 1995; it is also a fact that in July 1995, having been passed by the Northern Territory parliament, the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was given assent and passed into law; it is also a fact that in February 1996 there was, as we all know, a federal election campaign culminating in a poll on 2 March; and it is also a fact that Mr Kevin Andrews ran as an endorsed Liberal candidate for the seat of Menzies and was elected by a very large proportion of the electors of that electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made contact with those from my party who were campaigning at the same time, and I believe I am reliably informed that Mr Andrews made no mention at any time in any material or in any statements in that election campaign that he had concerns or would take action such as the action which he has taken in relation to the introduction of the bill that is before the Senate tonight. Mr Andrews introduced the Euthanasia Laws Bill in September 1996 and said in his first reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, the Northern Territory became the only place in the world to legalise what proponents describe as voluntary euthanasia . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He knew what had occurred in 1995 and I believe he knew what he intended to do in 1995. The quote that I referred to at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> beginning of my speech was a quote from the first speech of Mr Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies, on 5 September 1991, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Edmund Burke once described a good parliamentarian as one who is responsive to his electorate and able to employ his judgment and his skills for the benefit of his constituents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But in this matter Mr Andrews was not prepared to take to his constituents in the 1996 election campaign an intention to pursue the question of a private member's bill to overturn the Northern Territory legislation, which at that time had been law for over six months. I believe Mr Andrews had a duty to tell the electors of Menzies of his intention at the election and, as I said, he did not. I believe he was clearly opposed to the Northern Territory legislation at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have recently received some evidence that the overwhelming majority of the constituents of his electorate&mdash;Menzies&mdash;oppose this bill. We have also received some information by polling that an overwhelming majority of his constituents disapprove of his action in pursuing this bill. If that survey is correct, and in the context of what I have described as the circumstances, the chronology of events, then I think I and others are entitled to have serious concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Andrews was elected to represent the electorate of Menzies. If indeed, as I believe he did, he concealed his intentions at the election, it does not bring any credit on his actions in pursuing this bill. We are all voting according to our conscience on this matter, as I understand it, but Mr Andrews's conscience on this matter cannot be clear. If he did not bring this bill to the parliament, having first taken his intention to do so to his constituents when he clearly had the opportunity, then he is not bringing a bill to this parliament with a clear conscience. And in that regard, I believe it was improper of Mr Andrews to pursue this bill in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, he owes the electors of Menzies an apology for what I would describe as a betrayal of their trust, and I would condemn Mr Andrews in this regard. Neither he nor his supporters can afford to question the morality of others in these circumstances. I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1895"> believe that the electors of Menzies will easily forgive Mr Menzies for his chicanery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, the bill is here and I, like other senators, must address it and&mdash;if I choose to&mdash;vote upon it. I intend to vote upon it, and I intend to vote against the Andrews bill. I will do so substantially for the following reasons. Firstly, the Northern Territory legislation is clearly about voluntary termination of the life of a terminally ill person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the view that particularly was put by Senator Coonan last night that it is more appropriate for this issue to be judicially rather than legislatively managed. It seems to me that the opponents of the Northern Territory legislation have relied upon the circumstances in the Netherlands as pointing to the reasons why we should oppose the Northern Territory legislation, when in fact the Netherlands situation is based on a judicial administration of the system and not a legislative administration of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has occurred has occurred because the legislature has not led on the issue. I have heard many in this chamber and in the House of Representatives talk about and question the role of courts and the way that they may seek to interpret or make law. In this case, the Northern Territory parliament has led on an issue, has not left it for others, and is being criticised for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opponents of the Northern Territory laws have referred to the Netherlands situation, where apparently voluntary and involuntary euthanasia occurs in significant numbers. In this case, we are talking about a bill about which there is little real doubt that it is about voluntary termination of the life of a terminally ill person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, on the one hand, you cannot condemn the Netherlands situation but, on the other hand, support the method by which the situation has been reached as the preferred option for this country. In essence, if this bill is carried, that is what we will be doing. We will say that this legislature is telling the Northern Territory legislature, `You have no role in this matter. Leave it to the courts.' That is what we will be doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt that, at the moment around Australia, doctors end patients' lives with and without their consent. We can argue about how many times it occurs, but it does happen. We have also seen circumstances recently where family members who end the lives of sick loved ones are dealt with by the judiciary and by juries with great leniency when clearly they have ended the loved one's life with the intent to end their suffering. That is the trend in terms of the community and judicial treatment of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a case recently in my state of Tasmania where a young man shot his elderly father. He was not imprisoned, although convicted. That was the view of the judiciary on that matter. It was arguable that there was some consent by the father, but certainly not the sort of consent that the Northern Territory legislation requires. Are we really saying that is what we want, because that is where we will end up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a clear statutory direction on this issue is better than a situation where there is a gradual but uncontrolled opening up of access to euthanasia, however disguised. I believe we are not going to change community attitudes on this issue by voting for this bill. The community, it seems, overwhelmingly opposes this bill. I stress again that I support voluntary euthanasia only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a debate about this issue of voluntary euthanasia&mdash;assisted death&mdash;versus the question of allowing death by the withdrawal of treatment, and the third issue of the so&hyphen;called double&hyphen;effect treatment. It is arguable that often a cruel and painful death occurs on the withdrawal of medical treatment. Yet some who support this bill prefer that option to a lethal injection voluntarily sought and obtained. I find it hard to accept that it is better for someone to die in extreme pain or by starvation or asphyxiation than by a lethal injection sought freely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also looking at the issue of the double&hyphen;effect treatment&mdash;that is, where a doctor gives medication which has the effect of ending the life, although it is arguable that the intended effect was to end pain. On this matter, last night Senator Coonan said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1896">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may well be an area of the law which is unenforced and, for all practical purposes, unenforceable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Are we saying we are prepared to close our eyes and accept that this happens and say that that is better than the legislature prescribing a situation? Is that really better? I think not. We have to be honest with ourselves and with the Australian people on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the palliative care option and think we can do a lot more in relation to palliative care. Indeed, many of the supporters of the bill have talked about palliative care as the solution for a lot of people as a viable alternative to seeking euthanasia. I support that. We really have to put that in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has already been said in this debate that the government recently cut funding of palliative care programs. I think it was in the last budget. Did we hear any of the supporters of this bill openly opposing that and moving amendments to the appropriate legislation? We did not. If we are genuinely saying that that is where we want to go with this issue, people have to demonstrate that, not just say it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen hundreds of Australians over the age of 75 take their own lives in the last year. Most took their lives violently. We can never really know exactly why. But it is reasonable to speculate that some did so as their way of ending their own lives rather than undergoing a painful and prolonged death. Is that better? Is that really a better alternative than access to voluntary euthanasia, with the controls laid down in the Northern Territory legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of my conscience on this matter, I chose to ask myself a number of questions in relation to the exercise of my vote. I had to ask myself whether, if someone I loved was suffering a terminal illness and wanted to be helped to end their suffering by being helped to die, I could refuse their request for help. Would it be wrong for me to help them with their choice? Should such action be illegal? Should I or anyone be compelled to give such assistance? I must say I answered no to each question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory law does not offend me. I believe it is, in many respects, a piece 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of enlightened legislation and I hope that it is not overturned. It provides a compassionate, ordered process for a terminally ill person to follow and I hope that it becomes a benchmark for the rest of Australia. I, like many here, have had personal experience with loved ones and their departure from this earth. I choose not to discuss that in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of some other matters I just wanted to touch on, I do not believe that this is an issue of whether or not the Commonwealth parliament can or should interfere with the decision of a territory. I believe this issue ought to be determined on its merits. With respect to some other comments that were made, I would wish to associate myself with the comments Senator Newman made last night. I have a great deal of admiration for the comments that were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the question of a comparison of support for euthanasia and support for capital punishment, I reject that there is any comparison. On the one hand we are talking about a decision of a person freely reached to end their own life and on the other we are talking about a decision by society to end the life of another person against their wishes. I believe there is no comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion I would say this: whether this bill passes or does not means little in terms of the continuation of this debate. It will not conclude the debate either way. It is my belief now, having reached this point in the process, that the pro&hyphen; and anti&hyphen;euthanasia forces, having been mobilised, will fight their campaigns for the foreseeable future. I believe that candidates at the next federal election will be canvassed as to their support for or opposition to the principle of euthanasia. Public opinion on this issue may have an effect on the outcome of the election in particular seats as a result of those campaigns. I am not able to predict in which way it will turn, but I think we have embarked upon a debate which will continue in this country for some time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1897"> It could be argued that some of those who seek to hide behind the comfort blanket of states' rights are in fact shrouded by unconscionable political convenience. What is, of course, disputed is the desirability to enact the provision, the constitutional implications for the territories of the enactment of these provisions, the impact of the enactment of the provisions on the Northern Territory criminal code and the impact on, and attitude of, the Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a participating member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee which was given the important task of inquiry. I was able to listen to and inquire from those interested parties who came before the committee and also read the unprecedented number of written submissions together with letters from members of the committee who took the time to write to me personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to all sides of the debate and now stand before the parliament to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is far from an act to provide terminally ill patients the right to die. What it does is legalise doctors to kill. The universal adoption of this legislation would provide for a new generation of doctors graduating into our health system with the normality in medical practice of a licence to kill, causing a paradigm shift in the medical ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This convoluted legislation, despite all its safeguards, if allowed to stand irreversibly changes the medical ethic built up over the last 2,000 years when Hippocrates sought members of the medical profession to pledge an oath to observe the highest standards of moral and ethical conduct. Doctor Nitschke has indicated on ABC radio his enjoyment of the travel and publicity associated with his new career as a rights of the terminally ill facilitator. I asked Dr Nitschke:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would it be fair to say that you have neglected the life saving of drug users to participate more full time in the application of death to other patients?'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The doctor's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a true statement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, a doctor in Australia is turning his back on his six years of university 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education, turning his back on his pledged code of ethics and turning his back on his years of practical experience of caring for the sick and vulnerable in our society, and is now pulling from his medical bag this new instrument: a licence to kill. Does this mean killing clinics? Dr Nitschke's actions are evidence of a dangerous change in the medical ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987 the World Medical Association declared euthanasia to be unethical. The Australian Medical Association supports this position that euthanasia; that is, the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the patient's own request or at the request of close relatives, is unethical. Proponents of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act argue that the act empowers the individual to decide the end of their existence and that the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 threatens what in our democratic and liberal society is held so dear, the freedom of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would be true if the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act related to suicide, where the individual is the sole determinant of the outcome. John Stuart Mill, the often quoted authority on the rights of the individual, wrote in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Three Essays: On Liberty, Representative Government, The Subjection of Women</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only part of conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In that part which merely concerns himself, his independence is of right absolute.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is a piece of legislation that directly affects at least three others: two medical practitioners independent of the other, one with specialist qualifications in the patient's terminal illness and a qualified psychiatrist; and, less directly, the family, friends, the dependent, the vulnerable and the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Max Bell was denied the use of this legislation because he could not find a specialist who would assist him. Mr Bell is proof that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is not autonomous. He was a mentally competent, terminally ill patient who wanted to die, but a doctor would not consent to it. The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act creates a new executioner. Capital punishment has been rejected in the past partly because of the unintentional innocent victims. Euthanasia will also have its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1898"> innocent victims, perhaps more so than the number of so-called beneficiaries of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry, many things came to light. Perhaps the most shocking was the admission by Marshall Perron, the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and sponsor of the private member's bill, that he was unfamiliar with the term palliative care and what it really meant. In fact, on further questioning by me, he admitted it was only after he decided to introduce the legislation that he discovered palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1993-94 budget, the federal government announced a palliative care program costing $55 million over four years. The program was designed to maximise the quality of life of people suffering terminal illness, to avoid inappropriate hospital admissions and to provide support to families and carers. The Northern Territory government, with Marshall Perron as Chief Minister, did not take up the funding in the first year, denying the people of the Northern Territory comfort during terminal illness. What they got in its place was euthanasia legislation and perhaps gross political negligence at the expense of the territory's terminally ill&mdash;hardly what you would call a fair substitute. Perron told the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I certainly agree that palliative care in the Northern Territory, prior to the introduction of this legislation, was deficient. I accept responsibility for that, having been Chief Minister for a number of years up until that time . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if there is something good to come out of it all, it is that we all&mdash;all the politicians and all the community&mdash;know what palliative care means now. There is a deal of focus on it of course.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because of our sheer population we will be unlikely to have the sorts of facilities that are available in much bigger, better resourced states.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Had Marshall Perron known what palliative care was, the Northern Territory would have been much better off with the Commonwealth funding. The state governments are endlessly complaining about their health funding, and here is an example of where they did not even take up the offer. The Northern Territory AMA, in its submission to the committee, said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the experience of the Netherlands where euthanasia is not even legal, it is not unreasonable to assume that given time and distance, the cheaper option of Euthanasia over Palliative Care will become very attractive to this government as it struggles with the limited funding resources for its public health system versus escalating need and health care costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Ravenscroft, President of the Australian and New Zealand Society for Palliative Medicine, went further. He told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not have any doubt. The option is $30 for an injection or $10,000 to keep an AIDS patient going for a year and perhaps $20,000 to keep an ordinary palliative care patient going for a year. It is simple. You go for your $30 option and save a lot of money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Majority support for the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 will ensure that the $30 option is not available and medical treatment decisions will be made on a needs and not an economic basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps nowhere else are Aboriginal health problems more acute than in the Northern Territory. Making up 23 per cent of the population, many Aboriginals from both city and regional and remote areas have a distrust of Western medicine. Professor Ian Ring, who published research in 1996 on the health of our indigenous people in the Cape, found no improvement in any major health indicators since 1976. Despite government efforts, language, culture and remoteness keep Aboriginal people from seeking medical help until it is often too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we cannot group all Aboriginals into the one community, as the inquiry's terms of reference might suggest, we cannot ignore the unanimous response from Aboriginal individuals and groups to the committee on the effect of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. Similar evidence was heard by the Northern Territory select committee in 1995. Djiniyini Gondarra of the Northern Regional Council of Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress expressed the view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people are being driven further from the health services they are so desperately in need of because of the fear and suspicion generated by the existence of the new Northern Territory legislation. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1899">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We in this place and that other place know too well that perception is reality. For Aboriginal communities, the perception under the Northern Territory legislation is that, if you go to hospital, a doctor is allowed to kill you. We as a government have a responsibility to all Australians to provide the best health care and feeling of security within the health system. The Commonwealth will be meeting that responsibility with the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory, in its arguments, takes comfort in polling as the overwhelming support for euthanasia. However, one must question the accuracy of their polling when a significant proportion of the Aboriginal communities are in remote areas without access to telephones and where English is often a second, third or even a fourth language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`What is all the fuss about?' inquired Fred Finch, former Northern Territory health minister on ABC radio. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Aboriginal people would not utilise the legislation and, therefore, it should not really matter if they were not told about it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This kind of reasoning is really absurd. It is like saying that, because only one Aboriginal student graduated from an Alice Springs high school in 1996, most Aboriginal people would not utilise the education system, so why consult the Aboriginal community on curriculum? Same logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government stated that consultation with Aboriginal leaders and communities was a consistent feature of the development of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. But did the government listen? The Senate committee heard much about the safeguards in the legislation. These safeguards, we are told, restrict those able to use the legislation to mentally competent terminally ill patients. However, what I find myself asking is: where will this end, once society condones doctors killing instead of saving lives? I agree with Archbishop Hickey's comment during the inquiry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While that act remains in force, it impairs the intricate system of relations which sustain our civilisation and our laws. A new disturbing element is introduced into the relationship between the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doctor, nurse and patient; the family and its member facing death; the citizen and the state. The promoters of euthanasia say that those who are to die and those who are to kill under the legislation will always do so freely and willingly. These assurances are unconvincing enough in society as we now know it. What value would such assurances have in a society altered over time by legislation like the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Marshall Perron thinks that there are too many safeguards and that there is a case to expand the legislation to other categories. The first group that comes to his mind is non&hyphen;terminally ill competent adult quadriplegics. Ms Wright, speaking on behalf of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there should be no objection to a person . . . for whatever reason, if they find their life unbearable for quality of life reasons . . . availing themselves of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I find the strength of the human spirit a formidable thing, but pressure can eventually come to bear and break it down. The mere existence of the euthanasia legislation is itself a pressure on the elderly, the sick and the vulnerable. If we allow the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act to stand, if we allow `safeguards' to be dropped and if we allow the legislation to expand to other categories, we are saying to the elderly, the sick and the vulnerable that death is a cure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mentally competent elderly or incurably ill persons who are clinging to life consciously and with great determination will begin to feel the pinch of the legislation. So too will their family members and primary carers. Just over three months ago, I made a commitment to this parliament to reward the individual, unburden the dependent and protect the vulnerable. I honour that commitment today by supporting the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been pointed out by many of the senators in this debate, this is an issue which has profound implications for all within our community. I agree with Senator Cooney's comments in his additional remarks to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on this matter. He said: </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1900">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rights of the Terminally Act affects the nation as a whole. It influences the ethos, the culture, the attitude of people who live in various parts of this country. It is likely to affect those of many who live throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think we should hide from these potential implications. The importance of this debate has prompted me to make some additional comments that I had not originally planned. If I take a little more than the 10 minutes I estimated, I apologise to those following me, including Senator Tierney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue and debate which, I am sorry to say, has been characterised by simplistic and emotional reporting and an enthusiastic promotion of euthanasia advocates by much of the mainstream media. This media reporting has, in my view, denied many within our community an opportunity to hear an appropriate and reasoned debate on the issue. Views such as those of Dr Colleen McCullough have not been given the prominence which I feel they deserve and so I would like to open my remarks by quoting a letter that Dr Colleen McCullough wrote to me. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to becoming a full&hyphen;time novelist, I worked as a neuro&hyphen;physiologist. My experience with the terminally ill extended over 20 years. At first glance, euthanasia seems a welcome solution for those who do genuinely desire an easier, swifter and far less painful end to suffering. In an ideal world it would already be accepted practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But alas, our world is far from ideal, far from perfect. Therefore, I have grave misgivings about legalising euthanasia for persons afflicted with terminal or incurably incapacitating diseases. My reasons are grounded in human nature and chiefly concerned with the human propensity to think of events in terms of money or gain of one kind or another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it moral or ethical for a government to contemplate legislative action which inevitably incorporates an element of saving large amounts of taxpayers' money, when it simultaneously deprives other taxpayers of life?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is important to state at the outset that I intend to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill. I do so from a reasoned examination of the facts, of existing community evidence and evidence presented to the Senate's inquiry into the bill and also of the recommendations arising from the House of Lords inquiry, the New York State task force and the Canadian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate inquiry, all of which concluded that euthanasia cannot be safely legalised and that euthanasia laws pose profound risks to many individuals who are ill and vulnerable. Are we to disregard these recommendations and this evidence? My professional background also leads me to acknowledge my moral and ethical views, as a person raised as a Catholic. They also lead me to acknowledge the social and political framework from which I come and my own personal life experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it ironic, for instance, that Lindsay Tanner, in the other place, was somewhat lonely amongst the group often characterised as the socialist left when he commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many areas in our society where we inhibit individual freedom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">unlike many of his colleagues who are focused more on the importance of freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also find it somewhat ironic that last night Senator Coonan perhaps explained best the framework that I apply when she pointed out in her comments the importance of the balance between individual rights and the public interest. I would like to refer to the comments made by Senator Coonan last night because they are quite instructive. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assuming once again for the purposes of argument that sufficient safeguards could operate to protect the vulnerable and that consent were fully informed and freely given, the question is whether society should yield to that expression of individual choice or whether we as a society are justified in denying to a few fellow citizens assistance for the form of relief they seek. Are there risks to society collectively that outweigh individual freedom of choice to end a life in this manner? I have come to the view that extending end of life options to include a formal regime for voluntary euthanasia or physician assisted suicide does pose appreciable risks to the way our society is presently ordered and is not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hear, hear! It has been obvious that many within our community have similar apprehensions regarding the Northern Territory euthanasia act. This apprehension has been exemplified by the number of letters I have received and by the majority of the more than 12,500 submissions to the Senate inquiry into the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1901">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite Senator McKiernan's comments tonight, in an attempt to discredit some of those submissions, the counterargument could be put that submissions running the argument on the other side have also been questionable. Certainly, I can say from my experience that some of the methods have been questionable as well. But I do not think it does the debate service to go into that sort of argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stated that the responses from the general public to the Senate committee do not reflect mainstream community opinion on euthanasia and that public opinion polls demonstrate clear community support for the right to die. I would like to deal with that issue. They are correct on one aspect: the community does seem to support a person's choosing the right to die in what appear to be very limited and selective circumstances. They appear to support a person who is frail and ravaged by cancer choosing to die but do not support a teenage boy or girl suffering intense distress choosing to end their life. It is on that point that I would like to go back, not in too much detail, to my personal life experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman last night, in what I understand was a very moving contribution, and I respect her position in terms of her own life experience, unfortunately implied that the general public view might more reflect people not involved with groups or the like who have had life experiences associated with those people who are terminally ill. My own life experience from dealing with people with chronic illnesses and who have made suicide attempts actually leads me to support the Andrews bill rather than away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My life experience from dealing and working with people with disabilities leads me to support the Andrews bill and leads to my considerable concern about the way disability has been used within this debate. It leads me to considerable concern about the people who fight or strive for a continued dignified existence in ways which some people might characterise as undignified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman also made a comment in her speech which I think is implausible as a rationale for a choice in social policy. She said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I wish to have the right to knowingly choose the time of my death and the circumstances in which I die.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all might have that wish, but I do not think it is a strong basis for social policy. It seems more like a dream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder, though, whether the public supports the right of a person to be killed on request. Does the community support legalising what is currently illegal in states and territories other than the Northern Territory? Do they support an act which has the potential to fundamentally alter the doctor&hyphen;patient relationship if not the very culture of our society? Do they support doctors being granted the right to terminate the lives of those who are suicidal and terminally ill? Do they support the right of a doctor to intentionally kill by lethal injection another human being? These were questions asked by the pollsters for the mainstream when the polling was conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for me to also state that I have the deepest sympathy for those in severe pain and distress, who are terminally ill and are seeking relief from their suffering and pain. Many in our community have understandable compassion and a desire to help those who are suffering and who are wishing to experience relief from their suffering. But I believe that euthanasia is not the way to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the legislation was passed by a single vote even though the personal views of the majority of the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly opposed euthanasia in principle. I believe, because of the national significance and the potential effects of the right to die act, that the Commonwealth has an obligation to override it. It is apparent that the Commonwealth has the power conferred on it by the constitution to take this course of action. I also think that it would be inconsistent, as a Labor senator, to argue the territory or states rights issue. I feel it is incumbent upon those who oppose the Andrews bill to demonstrate why it should be feasible to codify in statute form circumstances in which life can be legally extinguished by another human being.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1902">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In articulating my position on this, I think it is instructive to refer to the comments by the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, which were also referred to in the Senate committee's report. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it possible to reduce to black and white law on the pages of a statute book the circumstances, and the safeguards in which we would allow the taking of a life? I have spoken to many experts, people engaged on both sides of this argument, and what has shaped my bottom line conclusion is the view that it is not possible to codify in law the safeguards, the circumstances, in which the extinguishing of a human life would be possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to examine arguments put forward by proponents of euthanasia and respond to them. A primary argument put forward by euthanasia advocates is that society should legalise what is already occurring within the medical profession. It is apparent that a minority of doctors are facilitating a patient's death when terminally ill. But is that sufficient justification to change the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An appropriate and perhaps current analogy would be to change gun laws because individuals could still obtain possession of illegal weapons. Should we change existing laws because this minority does not wish to adhere to the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, if doctors are at present breaking the law when it is illegal, what realistic constraints are there in a law where euthanasia is legalised? A recent survey in New South Wales indicated that up to 14 per cent of doctors replied yes when asked whether they had ever assisted a patient to die. I have grave concerns about the lack of protection for those seeking a lethal injection or assisted suicide&mdash;I think that is compassion also. How is abuse going to be prevented when the primary witness to the abuse is dead? Under the provision of the Northern Territory right to die act, provided the paperwork is in order after death, no questions will be asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument is that doctors, as part of palliative care practice, are presently killing patients by administering pain relievers in doses that are lethal. We have heard more about this tonight. Whilst this undoubtedly occurs, palliative care experts claim that it is the intention to relieve patient pain, not to kill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them&mdash;the intention that is critical. To put it into this framework, if you provide a pain&hyphen;killer which risks hastening death and the person is still alive, then you do not provide further doses unless they are required for more pain, but if a doctor is administering a lethal injection and it does not kill the patient, then the doctor would be required to administer a higher dose immediately and continue to do so until that person is dead. The objective is the determining factor. The lack of decent accessible palliative care is an issue that needs to be addressed, regardless of what happens with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument put forward, which I alluded to earlier, was that argued by Chris Gallus in the article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> yesterday&mdash;perhaps focused at some of her Liberal colleagues&mdash;where she opened the article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to the concept of Liberalism is individual responsibility and the rights of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The argument propounded by Ms Gallus is that the right to die is a matter of individual rights, that it is an individual choice and a matter personal dignity&mdash;that word again. To me, that is quite clearly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the individual wishing to die is asking is to be killed by another party. What is being requested is for the doctor to determine whether a patient will have a worthwhile life. Adding to the comments made earlier by Senator McKiernan, if you do not couch it in those terms, then the terms have to be whether we, as a society, should endorse some people suiciding and others not. But what protection does a person in pain and severe distress, who may ardently believe at the time that they make the request that they wish to die, have? How is the administration of a lethal does by a third party a matter of individual rights and liberalism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provisions of the right to die act, a patient has to wait for a cooling off period of 48 hours before they are able to receive a lethal injection. What protection is that, when you get 10 days for an encyclopaedia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of the slippery slope is familiar and has been addressed again many times tonight. To me, it still remains a powerful argument against legalising euthanasia. Even 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1903"> with the existing Northern Territory act, there is some confusion as to who might qualify for euthanasia. Under the Northern Territory act, euthanasia is defined as applying to people who have a terminal illness. Terminal illness applies to anyone, regardless of prognosis, who is in such a state of health that, if treatment were discontinued, they would die. A legal opinion has been provided by a group of QCs from around the country that this definition could logically include those who are not normally regarded as having a terminal illness but who require treatment to continue living. This includes people with diabetes who are dependent on insulin and people with asthma who are dependent on ventolin. In find this interpretation disturbing. I do not think it is just fear&hyphen;mongering. It is indicative of the scope that an interpretation of this act might come to rather than its original purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A disturbing trend has been established, for instance, in the Netherlands, where euthanasia is not legalised but is widely practised and tolerated by the government. The official guidelines claim that euthanasia is limited to those who have a serious physical illness and make a voluntary request for euthanasia. In a recent decision in the Dutch courts, a woman with no physical illness, but with a history of psychiatric illness, requested a lethal dose from her doctor. She had experienced recent domestic difficulties with her husband, who had walked out on her, and her two sons that had died, one through suicide. Her doctor provided her with a lethal dose. Despite the guidelines, the Dutch court held that she was an appropriate person for euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court held that all suffering is ultimately mental and it is both non&hyphen;compassionate and illogical to allow euthanasia for those suffering from physical causes but deny it to those suffering from non&hyphen;physical causes. The important lesson from this decision is that the courts will follow the principle to the very limits of its logic. It will not necessarily come back here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the majority of members of the medical profession who are at the coalface do not support legalisation of euthanasia. Organisations such as the AMA, disability groups, senior citizens 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groups, palliative care doctors organisations and other doctors have all expressed concerns. Who are we as parliamentarians to disregard the concerns of those facing these issues at the coalface?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, there are compelling arguments to override the Northern Territory right to die act. It is our responsibility as politicians to accept responsibility for the vulnerable and the disadvantaged and offer protection to them beyond a superficial freedom of choice. I conclude by quoting from Dr Brian Pollard in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Challenge of Euthanasia</EMPHASIS> where he talks about rights, a term I usually like to avoid. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a right to die is claimed in support of euthanasia, what is meant is something different. The same words are now used to mean a right to be killed on request and the right of another person to kill when asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be seen that this is a misuse of language and a mistaken concept of rights, since there is no right to be killed by another person, nor any right to kill on request. Such claimed rights have never appeared in any code of ethics or law and no argument is ever produced to justify them. It is therefore unreasonable to expect the law to be changed to protect rights that do not exist.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to make my contribution to the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. Some members of my family will be surprised by my vote because of my family's experience with death and dying from cancer. An aunt and an uncle of mine both had families with a predisposition to cancer. Their family formation created a genetic time bomb which prematurely took the life of my uncle, in his early 50s, and the lives of my two cousins, who both died of stomach cancer when they reached their early 40s. Three out of four members of that family were taken by cancer within 10 years. My mother, who had nursed her own mother before she had also succumbed to cancer, said many years after&mdash;an expression that reflected her rural upbringing&mdash;`If I ever get like that, just knock me on the head.' Therefore, I understand the feelings and the compassion which drive those who support euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surveys show that a majority of Australians support euthanasia and, indeed, personal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1904"> experience like this colours the opinion that is often expressed to opinion pollsters. But how accurate are these opinion polls? The touted 70 per cent support that is said to exist in the community for euthanasia must, I believe, be treated with some caution. As a former researcher who has designed questionnaires, I am well aware of the importance of the way in which a question is framed. If you ask a leading pejorative question, you can bias the results. For example, `Do you agree that the law ought to be changed to allow a doctor to give a lethal injection to a person suffering a terminal illness?' With such a pejorative question, you might doubt the sanity of the 30 per cent who fail to answer, `Yes.' Australians perhaps fear and do not comprehend death, so when this painless alternative is put it is seen as an easy way out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like a lot of my other Senate colleagues, I have received hundreds&mdash;it seems like almost thousands&mdash;of letters on this issue urging me to either vote for the bill or vote against it. These letters present some very compelling personal stories to influence one's final vote on the decision. In truth, we have all had to canvass our consciences on a broad range of issues to arrive at our final vote on euthanasia. These include the constitutional position of this parliament and the powers of the Northern Territory parliament; the morality of euthanasia; personal life experiences and anecdotal evidence; religious beliefs and commitment to those teachings; belief in a fundamental set of human rights, including life and liberty; the impact of medical ethics for doctors, nurses and carers; and the practicality of codifying euthanasia in statute law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want now to examine some key criticisms levelled against the Andrews bill&mdash;firstly, that the Andrews bill singles out the Northern Territory and impinges on territory rights. This is not true. The bill enacts a law to the extent of the Commonwealth's parliamentary powers. The Northern Territory legislation has rejected the national approach which prosecutes intentional killing and assisted suicide. Secondly, it is said that the Andrews bill invalidates the Northern Territory natural death act. Again, this is not correct. The bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is solely about euthanasia and no other matter. This bill has no retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill under consideration tonight, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, or the Andrews bill, restates two clear principles&mdash;firstly, that legislative assemblies of the territories should have no power to legislate the intentional killing of another. Secondly, this bill confirms that the legislative assemblies do have power to make law about the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical treatments to a terminally ill patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other principles have guided my decision on this legislation. Euthanasia raises enormous medical ethics issues for doctors. Hippocrates, in ancient Greece, said: `I will never give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to that effect.' The AMA, the nursing profession and the overwhelming majority of the caring professions are opposed to euthanasia. The doctor, not the disease, kills the patient if voluntary euthanasia is practised. There is a danger that legislation will put undue pressure on medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accurate diagnosis is also sometimes difficult. Doctors only give an opinion. Irrespective of the eminence of the doctor, it is well recognised in world practice that they can only give an opinion. Other speakers have given examples tonight and at other times in this debate, and in the other chamber, where diagnosis has been wrong and people have, following such a wrong diagnosis, resumed their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overseas experience in Holland suggests legislated euthanasia can lead to more control over the lives and the rights of people. A Dutch finding reported that upward of 20 per cent of people given a lethal injection had neither expressed consent nor had any knowledge of their impending death through injection. The advancement of incremental steps down the slippery slope&mdash;as so many have mentioned&mdash;as euthanasia law is expanded is a considerable concern. The first incremental step is voluntary euthanasia, which is followed by involuntary euthanasia. The third step is euthanasia for prescribed classes of persons: the aged and babies with deformities under one month or so. This could 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1905"> become a reality in future times once we start down this slippery slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unscrupulous relatives could also use euthanasia as a cloak to hide their greed. In 1997, care of the aged in our society does not have the priority it should. Euthanasia could become one of the convenient legal vehicles to cover quasi&hyphen;criminal activity. An elderly relative in a weakened mental and physical state could have their life ended prematurely for the financial gain of another person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Laws that legalise euthanasia also send very bad signals to the youth of Australia. Such law legitimises the concept of ending life early. Youth suicide in Australia is already one of the worst when compared with the Western world with 3,000 cases per annum. It is a greater killer in our society than road trauma. Millions of dollars are now spent by government and non&hyphen;government agencies to try to turn this tragedy around. The Northern Territory law and continuous publicity condone intentional killing and assisted suicide and, therefore, send the wrong message to our youth, many of whom see no future for themselves and are depressed and often suicidal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law is a very blunt instrument and not appropriate to regulate life and death in this way. The law does not have the finesse and flexibility to deal with all the issues associated with euthanasia. Statute law cannot cover every possible event or circumstance in life and death issues. It is too codified and inflexible. The Northern Territory act has shown this flaw already. There is a problem issuing death certificates for the first persons using the Northern Territory law as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all things in life should and can be regulated by law. What we should be doing is legislating for higher standards and quality in palliative care and enact modern refusal of treatment legislation. Neither of these options has been used in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have, therefore, on the basis of what I have said so far, in conscience decided to vote against the Northern Territory legislation which allows voluntary euthanasia. I will be casting my vote in the Senate for the Andrews bill&mdash;the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a historic debate. In fact, in my 10 years in this place, this is the first time on which I have had the opportunity to participate in an issue where a free vote has been allowed. As a Tasmanian who has crossed the floor to defend states rights, I have to ask myself what I should do. I acknowledge the strong and moving arguments put by my colleagues Senator Grant Tambling, Senator Bob Collins and the Hon. Nick Dondas protecting the rights of states and territories. They ask: why should a federal government override the decisions of states and territories? My answer to them, and to others who offer a similar view, is that, in this case, it is not a government which is attempting to override subordinate legislation; it is in fact a majority of individual people representing all parties and political persuasions in the Senate and the House of Representatives who will decide this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As individuals, we represent a broad cross&hyphen;section of the Australian community. We are elected by our constituents to make decisions on their behalf. In this unique case, I believe a majority of the people's representatives will say that the Commonwealth must override this particular territory law to protect the lives, in the future, of many other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like my colleagues, I have received hundreds of representations on this bill and, understandably, they represent a broad cross&hyphen;section of community views. There is not an individual in our community who has not been touched at some time or other by the death of a family member or loved one when the particular circumstances of that passing have no doubt had a profound effect on all involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not neglect the fact that of the 12,500 representations received by the Senate Legal and Constitution Legislation Committee, which was the most representations ever received in the history of the Senate, around 93 per cent opposed euthanasia. This was mirrored by the correspondence which has been directed to my own office. That correspondence has brought to my attention that the euthanasia legislation runs contrary to all major religions in the world, including Juda 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1906"> ism, Islam, Christianity and Eastern religions. Similarly, it runs contrary to all health care protocols and is opposed by all reputable doctors' associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their submission to the Senate committee, the national forum of the National Council of Churches, which is recognised as the most representative body of our Christian churches in this country, rejected euthanasia on the grounds that it was `contrary to God's law and the values of civilised society'. No higher a religious authority than His Holiness Pope John Paul II has said `the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral'. I believe that the views expressed by our churches represent the views of many in our community, but I also appreciate that there is a strong argument being put forward by opponents of this bill that we have a responsibility as a community to end the suffering of those with an incurable or terminal disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an emotional argument and, as one who has witnessed the suffering of a number of relatives, I can appreciate how this view arises. I feel for these people and acknowledge their genuine compassion. However, I would like to draw to the Senate's attention an article written in the Tasmanian newsletter of the Australian Medical Association by Professor Ray Lowenthal. Apart from being president of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Medical Association, Professor Lowenthal is a medical oncologist, palliative care physician, the current chairman of the Cancer Council of Tasmania and has had 30 years experience in the treatment of cancer. He was explaining the reason for the attitude of members of the AMA. He said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our attitude has nothing to do with a shift in the power balance between patients and doctors, as claimed by Dr Phillip Nietschke, a prominent proponent, in an interview published in the Paris&hyphen;based International Herald Tribune, and certainly not from any lack of compassion. The vulnerability of the frail and infirm impels us. `Can't something be done . . . ' is a question put from time to time by distressed relatives but almost never by dying patients themselves. But the family's attitude causes anguish. Should one life be shortened because of another's distress? . . . For the dependent and the powerless, the pressure may overwhelm. Yet people value life differently when they are well and when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are facing death: then, every day is precious. As long as the symptoms are tolerable, every extra moment with family and friends is a bonus.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is no coincidence that, when we look at this question of suffering and dying, the type of experience detailed by Professor Lowenthal is also reflected in a submission I received from Mr Pat Flanagan, the manager of Mary's Grange Home at Taroona in my own state of Tasmania. Mr Flanagan wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After observing many deaths in this home, there are three observations I would like the make&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  Sometimes it is the relatives who cannot cope with the concept of someone dying. The actual person can be quite accepting of the situation. In this case, euthanasia is a solution for the relatives, but what of the person?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  The aged, facing a limited future (with often vastly reduced facilities), frequently express the wish not to be a nuisance, not to be a burden. This reflects their diminished self&hyphen;esteem and, possibly, Australian society's view of the aged. As such, these people can be highly susceptible to certain ideas put to them i.e. you should go into a home. In some tragic cases, families exploit these feelings.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, Mr Flanagan makes what I believe is the most pertinent observation in relation to the whole euthanasia debate when he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is not uncommon for residents of a home to say they wish to die, when death approaches, they often fight it with tenacity and dogged determination.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many people here who have put their own slants on this debate. Like many other people, I have my own feelings on this matter. Just two years ago my father died. I worked with my father from the age of 15. We lived and worked together on a farm until I was married. Even after that I worked in partnership with my father until he retired. Unfortunately, in later years he suffered from the often quoted and increasingly occurring Alzheimer's disease. The family eventually had no alternative but to put my father in care. It got to the stage where for him to live with my mother was quite unfortunate and it was too traumatic for him to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As his health deteriorated, it crossed my mind on more than one occasion, because I had worked with him on the farm and we had had the experience of putting down sick animals, whether if he had all his faculties he would have said, `Put me down.' He was a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1907"> person who loved his family and needed them. Of course we needed him. In my opinion, it was out of the question that that sort of thing should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in the last few weeks there was great pressure on us all, and as his health worsened we had in the back of our minds a hope that he would pass on. As it happened, we had a family meeting and we decided to bring our father home for whatever time it took because he was in a terminal state. I suppose, through his life, in death my father united the family in a way that he never had in his lifetime. We were all good friends and worked together, but in those last few weeks he united the family in a way that I will never forget and I think the rest of the family will never forget. We nursed him over those last two or three weeks. My sister and I were with him when he died. In finality we all know that God's way was the only way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many arguments which have been put already by my colleagues in the Senate as to why we should protect human life. There have been some very moving speeches made on both sides of the argument. I think issues such as the sanctity of life and the impact on our society if we devalue the life of one individual are most important. The religious beliefs which I mentioned earlier, the slippery slope which has been quoted on many occasions, the erosion of medical ethics and the deterioration of doctor&hyphen;patient relations are most important in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamental also is the issue of palliative care. There are significant advances being made in this particular area of medical treatment and I know that there are concerns that the growing use of euthanasia would impact upon the resources which are being made available there. It is possible for one to face death with dignity and it is possible that the time spent with a loved one can be quality time, although not in the traditional sense of what we may consider quality time when we are fit and healthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is acknowledged that palliative care and the treatment of the elderly is not cheap, but it is a responsibility which we in society must bear in the same manner in which traditional families consider it their responsibility to take 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care of their elderly relatives. We should not as a society use euthanasia as a means of saving money in the care of the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one last issue I wish to raise and that is the possibility that euthanasia could be misused. The previous speaker mentioned this. I note in a very good paper on the inquiry into euthanasia that was conducted by the British House of Lords that euthanasia advocates in Holland were forced to admit that it was impossible to devise safeguards against the abuse of euthanasia practices. Investigations into the practice of euthanasia in Holland in 1990 found that 20 per cent of deaths each year were by euthanasia and only 10 per cent of those who died had actually given a formal request. I am sure these figures are of concern to everyone in the Senate and everyone participating in this debate. I would hate to see these types of figures ever become relevant in the care of our elderly in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I would like to draw upon the findings of the British House of Lords select committee which in paragraph 237 of its final recommendations concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Society's prohibition of intentional killing . . . is the cornerstone of law and social relationships. It protects each of us impartially, embodying the belief that all are equal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am proud to be a member of our Australian community and I value the laws and beliefs which we all hold dear. I cannot support the use of euthanasia as I believe it is contrary to the belief on which our nation has grown and prospered.</PARA></SPEECH>

As senators and many members of the public would know already, I oppose this legislation, and the reasons for my opposition to it have been canvassed in the additional comments that Senator McKiernan and I made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue, regardless of whichever way we vote in this legislation, is one that we have all lived with and, regardless of what happens, one that we will continue to live with in our personal lives outside of politics. Like many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1908"> others who spoke in this debate, I have also suffered the experience of friends and relatives who have suffered slow, painful deaths&mdash;some as recently as the last 12 months or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always wondered, as I have been with them, what I would like to happen. Of course, that is something that has been canvassed by many senators in this place. I have always wondered whether quicker would be better and&mdash;as I think all of us have&mdash;have often been relieved at the end of the suffering. So often I have always wanted that suffering to end and to end early. Just as often, I have walked away knowing that a decision was probably taken and that quite often honest, caring people have been made to feel guilty by their actions and by the lack of protection of the law. It is these sorts of issues that have confronted everyone in a very direct and personal sense as they have experienced the suffering and the passing away of close friends and relatives. Overwhelmingly, this debate has been conducted on that plane in this particular place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to comment on some elements of the debate. The analogy, for instance, with nazism is one which is totally inappropriate and totally offensive both to many victims of Hitler's Germany and their families, some of whom are living in Australia, the victims of the genocide and also to the well meaning in our society who are concerned about and are supportive of a proposal like euthanasia. It does no-one any good at all&mdash;especially, I must say, the clerics&mdash;to draw the analogy with Hitler's Germany and nazism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue where, no matter what our position, we can find many reasons, many arguments, many quotations, many reports from across the world to support one position or another. I do not want to recanvass the detailed reasons that Senator McKiernan and I have given for our report. I want to restate the fundamental basis of the view reached by Senator McKiernan and me: individually, neither of us wish to deny others the right to use the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. Nor, for that matter, do we want to deprive other Australian citizens, in particular&mdash;due to the provisions of this bill&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">the people of the ACT, of the right to choose how they end their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, I wish to focus on the issue that I believe is central to this debate, and that is the issue of conscience. I do not think there can be any doubt that this bill raises significant issues of conscience. We all have different views as to what `life' means to us, and this bill and the subject of euthanasia go to the heart of what each of us understands that meaning to be. The strength of the views that have been displayed on each side of this debate and the deep emotion this debate has stirred in this community are both testaments to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When matters as fundamental as this come before the parliament, it is not surprising that the first reaction of members and senators is to defiantly stand by their own views as to what is right and what is wrong. However, that is a judgment I do not want to make tonight. I accept that there is genuine and heartfelt division within our community as to what to do on this subject. There are genuine divisions of conscience as to whether euthanasia is right or wrong. I also note that, rather than debate these issues within our party fora, many on both sides of the debate have argued that it should be left to the individual consciences of members and senators to determine what they feel is right and what is wrong. I think that has been the right position to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue, it has been argued, should be left to each of us to determine for ourselves in accordance with our own individual views and morality within our own sense of the meaning and value of life. Having listened to much of this debate, I must say that I am a bit disappointed by the response of many who have taken the privilege that has been vested in us and decided that they can and must impose their conscience on that of others. Many of those who have fought vociferously to throw off the shackles of the party view&mdash;and, as I said earlier, rightly so&mdash;and who stood up for the right to exercise their own personal consciences are now willing to apply their own shackles to the consciences of many individuals across Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1909">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those who have accepted that this is a vote of conscience have, I submit, a duty, an obligation and a responsibility not to abuse that privilege by denying the consciences of others. If we can accept that this is an issue upon which we as party members&mdash;as members and senators&mdash;can be legitimately divided, then surely it is an issue that we as a community can be genuinely divided on as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have demanded that we be allowed to exercise our conscience to choose, I submit we should not seek to prevent others from exercising their right to choose. We should not disregard the rights and consciences of our fellow Australians and we should not assert that, on matters of conscience, we have superior rights to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That I fear and believe is precisely what this insidious bill seeks to do. It seeks to prevent the people of the Northern Territory and the ACT, through their elected representatives, from exercising their consciences and from making their own judgments about the meaning and value of life. More particularly, it seeks to deny all Australians as individuals the right to make that judgment for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as repugnantly, this bill seeks to apply its moral righteousness not to the people of Australia as a whole but rather to the people of the Northern Territory and the ACT. It singles them out as being somehow unworthy of the right to exercise their own consciences. It treats the hundreds of thousands of Australians who live in the territories as if they were second&hyphen;class citizens, as has been argued very strongly by Senator Tambling and Senator Bob Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if individual members and senators or members of the public disagree with euthanasia, they have a legitimate right to choose otherwise and to not exercise their rights under any legislation. But I ask all of you, and I ask them, not to force that choice on others, thereby denying our fellow citizens of a right citizens cherish very highly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So any conscience vote in this parliament should, as a matter of fundamental obligation, respect the consciences of others. Many of us, for instance, have indicated that we personally 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would choose life. That, I think, includes me, but it is a very hard decision and one, as I say, as I have lived through the experience of others, I have found very hard to address and come to a conclusion on. I think as things stand I would choose life, but I, like many others, are willing nonetheless to respect the choices made by others. For this and the other reasons mentioned in the additional comments in the report of Senator McKiernan and me, I urge all senators to oppose this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution to this debate to indicate my reasons for voting the way I intend. First of all, I want to thank all of those very sincere and committed people on both sides of the argument who believe passionately in their approach for the time taken and the effort they have made to make me aware of their beliefs and the matters they believe I should take into account. I also want to pay tribute to my colleagues on the Senate committee for their difficult and time&hyphen;consuming task in attempting to guide the Senate in its deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention that in forming my view I have as well taken into account, in what I emphasise is only a very secondary way, the views of certain people and organisations for whom I have the highest regard. These include: the Liberal Party of Australia, speaking through its Federal Council; the Young Liberal Movement&mdash;of which I am a life member and a former federal patron; my parliamentary colleagues from the Northern Territory; the Law Council of Australia, which represents the legal profession in Australia and of which I continue to be a member, speaking unanimously through its constituent bodies&mdash;the bars and law councils of each state; various church people and groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the response to the Senate committee is at odds with public opinion polls and the impression I get from public meetings I have attended and from my own discussions with constituents. But this is not, in my view, of great consequence in the decision I have to make. I do believe that in a democracy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1910"> citizens speak through their elected representatives in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My opinion is, I believe, no better formed than the views of a democratically elected parliamentarian of the Northern Territory&mdash;a parliamentarian who was required over a much longer period of time than I to determine how the laws of that state like territory should apply. I am not one of those who believe that because I am in the federal parliament my opinions are that much superior to those of representatives of the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us is not one of general application but is one intended to override the wishes of a parliament of one part of our country. But I am required to vote according to my conscience. I regret the allegations that some have made that by voting in favour of the Northern Territory legislation I will be killing someone or that one person will be able to determine the death of another human being. I do not believe that fallacious argument has been at all helpful to the debate. Any proposed legislation that ever suggested that this could be done legally in Australia would be vehemently opposed by me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most telling argument put to me for voting against the Northern Territory legislation was the suggestion that some elderly terminally ill people may feel pressured to shorten their lives because they were a burden on their family and loved ones. In the end, I came to the conclusion that this is related more to the elderly generally who would not in any case be able to take advantage of the Northern Territory  legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation, as I understand it, applies only to the terminally ill who are mentally able and so certified to be able to make the decision to shorten their lives. The feelings of the frail aged that they are a burden on their family will not be strengthened or weakened by this bill. Only greater family love and understanding and the assistance of the churches and other people of compassion can help to overcome the trauma and sometimes sadness of the frail aged. The Northern Territory legislation is not about those people; it is about the terminally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument I want to briefly deal with is the one that is summarised by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allegation that the Northern Territory legislation is the thin edge of the wedge. I am dealing with the law as passed by the Northern Territory parliament, not some hypothetical legislative possibility of the future. Any extension that gives one person the right to make decisions about another person's life will also be vehemently opposed by me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My decision finally comes down to one of individual choice and freedom, provided that there are watertight safeguards in place to ensure the ability to make an informed and rational decision. I have seen a brave Christian committed family lady make the decision that the inevitable should be brought forward but, as with most things in her life, it was only her absolute determination that allowed her to die happily knowing that she had overcome. Her decision took many months to consummate because of even her frail body and also because of the inability of the law to help her&mdash;even this law. But in the end, after a long uncomfortable and torturous battle, I suspect that at the very end she was assisted in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot accept that those who are terminally ill should not have the right themselves of their own free will to shorten their suffering. To do otherwise is, I believe, unchristian and uncharitable and lacking in compassion. I intend to oppose the bill before the Senate for these reasons. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note the statement made today in the Senate by the Leader of the Democrats, and her attempt to table "parts" of a letter from Professor Funder. I believe that the letter in question is already part of the Hansard record from 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senator states that "The report shows that Dr. Hapel is `a bit loose with his facts'". I have no choice but to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly Prof. Funder made the award to me of an NH&amp;MRC fellowship subject to my undergoing appropriate medical evaluation so that myself, and the JCSMR could be assured that my continuing to work at the bench "is not only possible but does not endanger himself or those around him".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is not a condition of award of an NH&amp;MRC fellowship that one undergo any sort of medical assessment. So on principle I would not undergo such an examination to satisfy Prof. Funder or the NH&amp;MRC. Thus Prof. Funder's judgement was in effect that I should not be awarded a fellowship by the NH&amp;MRC. There is no escape from that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor is there any escape from the other questions raised by my letter of 28 Jan 1997, as tabled by Senator Harradine. Let me be clear here that the complaint goes back to 1992 and was investigated by the Privacy Commissioner. It is not a recent issue as implied by the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the NH&amp;MRC fellows that I know has been asked to provide a medical opinion that `clears them from being a danger to themselves or their fellow workers.' Surely such a request is a discriminatory condition of award of a fellowship by the NH&amp;MRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach a copy of Prof. Funder's letter of invitation from ANU to help them with the problem of implementing the recommendations of the Stephen Committee report in the JCSMR. Nowhere in it do I see a request to weed out possible defectives with poor eyesight. This letter of appointment was not sufficient to convince the Privacy Commission that Prof. Funder could be held accountable for his recommendations since he appeared not to be earning a wage for his work on behalf of the ANU chancellery. Since he technically was not employed by a federal agency Prof. Funder was apparently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> immune from investigation by the Privacy Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we return to the main points of this debate. Why was I not formally interviewed? Where did the information about my allegedly poor eyesight come from? Why was this information used by Prof. Funder in his report? And why single me out for such treatment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was it just hearsay? Who knows. As Senator Harradine has stated in the Senate I have maintained a good level of performance despite alleged problems with my eyesight. I would not like to think that my career was in any way harmed by the advice of Prof. Funder</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see the Funder recommendations of 1991/2 pertaining to JCSMR as a disgrace. Many others do too. I sincerely hope that the Leader of the Democrats shares this view. To appoint the author of these recommendations to chairmanship of the peak health authority in this country would have been, based on the evidence, unfortunate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 June 1992, Captain Bill Bone, Captain Bill Craig, Captain Peter Ivanoff and Captain Love, as complainants, sought relief from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission against Australian Airlines who, as respondent to the proceedings, strongly resisted their claims. By consent of the parties, the commission dealt with all four cases together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 30 August 1996, the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, delivered the report of his inquiry into the four cases to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams AM, QC, MP. The second paragraph on page 19 of that report neatly sums up the issues in the inquiry. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complainants had all worked under contract as pilots on domestic B727 or A300 aircraft operated by Australian Airlines, now part of Qantas Airlines Limited, (the respondent). Mr Bone commenced his contract on 10 January 1990, Mr Craig on 24 March 1990, Mr Ivanoff on 27 October 1989 and Mr Love on 24 November 1989. Each of the complainants had extensive prior service with Australian Airlines. Between August 1990 and May 1992 the respondent terminated the employment of the complainants upon their reaching 60 years of age pursuant to a compulsory age-based retirement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1912"> policy. The contracts under which they were employed did not include a specific clause to provide for compulsory retirement at that or any other age. Each of the complainants held a First Class Airline Transport Pilot Licence and a valid Class 1 medical certificate at the time of termination. These basic facts of the complaints are agreed by all the parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is essential to a proper understanding of this matter to know that, immediately after Australian Airlines sent Peter Ivanoff into retirement, he was engaged by another airline company as a B727 captain and continues to work as a contract B737 simulator instructor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 30 March 1994, the federal parliament amended the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to make it unlawful to terminate a person's employment on the grounds of his or her age. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 has preserved the provision. This is in keeping with International Labour Organisation convention No. 111. Following the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act, Captain Allman, a pilot then employed by Australian Airlines, reached 60 years of age. He lost his job as a consequence and, because of that, took proceedings for relief in the Industrial Relations Court relying on the amended act. On 18 May 1995, Chief Justice Wilcox found in his favour ordering that Qantas&mdash;who in the meantime had taken over Australian Airlines&mdash;re&hyphen;employ him. It did so. Subsequent to this decision, Qantas ceased to impose a retirement age on its domestic pilots. Neither it nor Ansett now do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 14 August 1995, roughly 17 months after the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act and almost three months on from the decision of Chief Justice Wilcox, Mr Chris Sidoti was appointed as Human Rights Commissioner. He undertook the resolution of the cases of Captains Bone, Craig, Ivanoff and Love. On page 20 of his report to the Attorney-General, he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of inquiries and investigation into the compulsory age&hyphen;based retirement of the complainants it appeared to the former Human Rights Commissioner that the practice constituted discrimination. Upon appointment as Human Rights Commissioner on 14 August 1995 I reviewed this finding and formed the same opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, pursuant to sections 33 and 27(a) of the Act, I invited the respondent to make submis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sions either orally, in writing or both in relation  to the practice of compulsory age-based retirement. The respondent elected to make oral submissions in addition to its written submissions made during earlier stages of the inquiry and after the preliminary finding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 November 1995 I convened the inquiry in Melbourne to take oral and written submissions from the respondent. As a matter of procedural fairness, the complainants were also invited to participate in the process. The complainants and respondent were legally represented at the submissions hearing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 26 of his report, Mr Sidoti states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither party submitted any evidence significantly different from that put to Wilcox CJ on the medical and safety issues. The respondent maintained its view that pilots over the age of 60 represent a health and safety risk. However, it did not appeal from the decision of Wilcox CJ and now has 6 pilots over the age of 60 flying its aircraft on a regular basis. I am sure that, if it seriously considered this a risk to airline and passenger safety, it would have taken and exhausted every possible avenue of appeal from the Chief Justice's decision. The fact that it did not do so speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 12 April 1996, the commissioner found `that the acts and practices complained of by the complainants, namely their compulsory retirement upon reaching 60 years of age, constituted discrimination in employment based on age'. Mr Sidoti made three recommendations to the respondent. The two relevant here were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the respondent should pay to Mr Bone, Mr Craig, Mr Ivanoff and Mr Love compensation for loss of earnings suffered by reason of the discriminatory conduct of the respondent;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the respondent should make the necessary arrangements for Mr Ivanoff to undertake "over 60" medical tests and, if these and other requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority are satisfied, re-employ Mr Ivanoff and where necessary retrain him as a pilot to fly aircraft as near to equivalent is as possible to those he was flying prior to his compulsory retirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Qantas refused to accept these recommendations. It told the commissioner, amongst other things, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qantas has considered the recommendations made in respect of the compensation for the individual complaints and the re-employment of Mr Ivanoff at a senior level within the company. It has given the recommendations serious consideration recognising your statutory discretion to make such recommendations where you think appropriate. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1913"> Qantas has decided, however, that it is not appropriate to accept the recommendations in this case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When it was legally obliged to re-employ Captain Allman, Qantas gave way to compulsion. When it was morally obliged to re-employ Captain Ivanoff, it defied propriety. It showed itself a poor corporate citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does its conduct towards these pilots reflect its true character? Is Qantas a company which will do the right thing only when compelled by law to do so? The various outcomes for the men named in my adjournment speech tonight indicate that it is. Advise Qantas of the right course to follow and defiance is the result; command it to act properly or legal consequences will follow and it fears to do otherwise. Spare the rod and spoil the airline&mdash;it is a sorry profile for what is supposedly a great Australian icon to present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I believe that corporate life is best when informed by a moral sense rather than inhibited by prescriptive laws. But where a moral sense is blunted, the cut of regulations must be sharpened. That is cause for dismay for right&hyphen;thinking companies though apparently not for Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community life is at its best where its members act towards each other on the basis of mutual respect, of courtesy, of a sense of honour, of a consciousness of the dignity of others. Where its citizens deal with each other as if the letter of the law is the only thing that matters, its quality is sadly prejudiced. Qantas loves the law but not its ethos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Chris Sidoti has rendered a vital service to the community in producing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of inquiry into complaints of discrimination in employment and occupation&mdash;compulsory age retirement</EMPHASIS>. Its presentation in parliament has enabled that institution to see how four decent men, dedicated to flying aircraft with great skill and experience for their employer, have been treated by Qantas. They put their cases before a commissioner who made a decision about them in accordance with the legislature's intent. Qantas has defied that intent. Parliament should not allow that recalcitrance to go unnoticed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the serious state of our science and technology sector. Honourable senators may be aware of a forum that was held today at the National Press Club entitled `Putting the talent to work'. It was organised by the Federation of Australian and Technological Societies and the National Tertiary Education Union. Today's forum highlighted the lack of career opportunities and career structures for younger scientists engaged in research and sought constructive solutions to make the very best use of their talents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may have seen at the Press Club luncheon today Professor Ian Lowe who was the keynote speaker at this function. I believe his comments, and certainly his address, were right on target. There is an Australian malaise in science and the government, unfortunately, has failed to recognise the value of science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significant challenges of the future are within our lifetime and will require a response and serious action. They include environmental issues such as global warming, pollution, starvation, emergent diseases, environmental degradation, population pressures and a whole range of other global and local happenings. Science and technology will most likely provide us with some of the solutions to these problems and will most certainly identify relevant considerations and workable solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, was perhaps following a perilous path when he suggested today that the concern about the prospects for young scientists was a false crisis. Many offices, not only my own, have received many letters, faxes and e&hyphen;mails complaining about the future prospects for young scientists&mdash;not only those people who are currently involved in science studies but also those students in secondary schools who are considering science based courses at university and science based careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope this is not perhaps another Austudy actual means test case where the warning signs are coming through very early but, unfortunately, the government is not necessa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1914"> rily taking notice. Something the government has done which is contributing to this crisis in science is the increase in the HECS fees for students in tertiary institutions. Charges for science per annum are now $4,700. That puts science and technology courses in the second highest band, making them the second most expensive courses. Adding to this factor is the erosion of academic salaries, conditions and opportunities. Science is not a particularly attractive career option for many young people as a result. The enrolment figures this year illustrate that young people are choosing courses other than science. This is because young people understandably are increasingly employment focused and thinking about their futures. Science, unfortunately, does not offer a secure future at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forum today provided a number of examples of young people who have excelled at science and undertaken considerable education and training to make themselves eligible for science and technology jobs. These talented people are at the stage of their careers where they seek some permanency and an opportunity to develop continuity and make the choice whether to give up or continue. The talented people are deciding not to continue and their loss should be of grave concern to the decision makers in this country and the federal government. Without the brightest and best, we are not taking advantage of our best assets in this country and the people best able to provide the answers to the challenges I mentioned for our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I recall Senator Harradine's question today to the chamber on patenting and&mdash;something I certainly have great concerns&mdash;patenting of genes and gene sequences. Another issue that both Senator Harradine and I have raised in this place is the whole ethical and legislative dilemma of cloning: how we approach that as decision makers and how scientists are involved in that ethical debate and the pursuit of further scientific advances. All of these issues demonstrate politically and academically that we must be focusing more on the area of science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Science and Technology has acknowledged quite openly in budget documents and in recent press releases that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> science and technology are Australia's No. 1 wealth generator and the key to improving all of our lives. If this is true&mdash;and it is certainly something the Australian Democrats and I agree with&mdash;then we must provide our young scientists with the possibility to set down their ideas and visions by creating jobs opportunities and real futures for them. This reiterates Professor Lowe's comments today that Australia will lose out on the growth industries of the future. This is important. It is a serious matter and it should not be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The art of creativity and nurturing upon which science and engineering rely does not always march to the beat of an economic drum and certainly not to short&hyphen;term economic timetables. The market drive to reduce funding and to seek accountability must be balanced with the pursuit of excellence and the quest for knowledge. Focusing on reducing funding alone, whether it is through a general budget deficit reduction strategy or within our tertiary institutions, will stunt the discoveries and the inventions on which our future depends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a serious commitment from this government and state governments to support and fund innovative science programs in schools and create a vital research community with real career opportunities. I do acknowledge that $12 million has been set aside by the minister for a program designed to promote science in schools and to encourage young students in schools to pursue science based courses. I must say that $12 million over a three&hyphen;year period is just a drop in the bucket but a good start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a role in encouraging private sector research and development and the private sector forms an integral part of the research and development future of Australia. I believe the government must recognises the value of science teaching and research and the long&hyphen;term benefits that follow from healthy and vibrant research.</PARA>

I was particularly impressed with the way the Australian defence forces and their environmental unit looked after the Shoalwater Bay area generally throughout the year and particularly at the time of this major exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited the site, along with many other parliamentarians.

Unfortunately, they did not avail themselves of the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My visit started with a briefing generally on the exercise and particularly on the environmental aspects. I was very impressed with the fact that material had been prepared for each one of the more than 20,000 combined American and Australian troops who were taking part in the exercise and the pamphlets that were given to them were very detailed and got across a good and proper message on how the training area should be used, taking very high regard of the environmental significance of the area. As well as these pamphlets there was a newspaper specifically prepared. That provided interesting reading and had a message.</PARA>

They say it is one of the few areas in the world which give such a diversity of experiences for an army exercise. They also could not speak highly enough of the Australian defence forces. I should mention that and I would like to even repeat it because they were genuinely complimentary of the standard and professionalism of the Australian forces. It does make me proud to hear that and it does Australians good to know that we are defended by a very professional and well&hyphen;trained group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the advantage of flying over the Shoalwater Bay area by helicopter. It is an absolutely huge area and you really cannot appreciate the large area without seeing it from the air. It is very well maintained. They tell me there is not a lot of native fauna there, which I found unusual, but our environmental experts and caretakers&mdash;although they are not called caretakers anymore&mdash;did indicate that the fauna is just not naturally there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some work done in getting rid of feral animals from the mainland and some of the islands. The area seems to me to be very well maintained. There was a program to look for and identify dugong, although at the time I was there, which was fairly late, my escorts did not then have any evidence of dugong sightings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there were over 20,000 troops in this area but it was very difficult to find out where they were and where they had been except at the main base, on roads leading to and from, and at exercise areas. I suppose that was part of the exercise. We did stop at Freshwater Beach, which is a magnificent beach in the Shoalwater Bay area. There had been a cyclone around for the previous week or so and there had been some severe erosion caused by the cyclone to the beach, which was already repairing itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We arrived at Freshwater Beach on Monday, which was the day after a great number of American troops had landed on the beach with all of their equipment. On our visit the next day it was very difficult to see where they had been. Interestingly, although the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1916"> exercises were very real and lifelike, most of the way along the dunes behind the beach had been taped off by our environmental people so the attacking marines were able to go further inland, but only along a specially selected path that had been identified by our environmental experts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I certainly claim no technical expertise I was very impressed with the technical expertise of the people in the Australian Army. They are not actually army officers, they are civilians, but they work as a unit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the Australian defence forces and monitor, plan and enhance the environment of the area. I was very impressed with the work they were doing and I was very impressed with the work the Australian defences forces generally are doing in that area in preserving a fairly significant training area in the world but, as well, in preserving a very significant environmental site.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information to permit a comprehensive answer to the honourable Senator's question is not readily available. To collect and assemble it would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling such information. However, after investigating the matters raised I can provide the following response which may be of use:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Partial reduction of benefit as a form of applying a breach penalty was not applicable during the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of social security breaches which resulted in complete withdrawal of income support payments for the 1995&hyphen;1996 financial year was 109,842. Of this number a proportion of customers appealed against the decision to impose a breach and were successful in having their payment granted or restored and the breach set aside. It is estimated that some 15,000 customers had their breach set aside during 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) An estimate, of the salary cost only, to administer breaches for 1995&hyphen;96 is $1.818 million. It is difficult to determine the cost of identifying and administering breaches and penalties as many elements of the Department are involved and cannot be separately identified for costing purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Currently available information does not allow an accurate savings figure to be provided. An estimate for savings from breaches for 1995&hyphen;96 is $39.891 million assuming an average breach length of 3.7 weeks for activity test breaches and 2.3 weeks for administrative breaches.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The gross number of breaches coded was 109,842.
