<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night we were discussing this amendment, and I suspect there was some support for it in the chamber, although we were only at the initial stages of discussion. My concern is with subparagraph (ac). I am quite happy to support the first part of that section of the amendment. I think the provision of statistics for the public to see how the new scheme will be administered will be quite useful to the public. I just do not know how methodologically anyone in government will go about analysing any discrepancies in practices, which is what is required by the second part of the Democrat amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be much happier if Senator Murray were to proceed with the first part of his amendment, as a consequence of which the public and the parliament would have information as to the issuing source of the warrants, and then we can make our own conclusions as to whether the scheme has been administered properly or not. The second part, as I say, is so broad and general that, firstly, it may be hard to administer and, secondly, I would anticipate that the information that would be provided would be quite sanitised and useless to the public debate. If Senator Murray is prepared to proceed with the first part of his amendment, the opposition is prepared to support that.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would be very concerned if that happened without me being able to move that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in general support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF> , for in many ways the bill that we are discussing this morning is a bill which Labor, believe it or not, introduced in the previous parliament. Two years down the track we are still dealing with the legislation of the previous Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 1994, in fact, so we have only been three years in deliberations on this particular concept. As the minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General pointed out in her second reading speech in this place, this bill arose from a report of the Administrative Review Council, a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in government Labor responded to that report by introducing our bill, as Senator Harradine said, in 1994. There was consultation on it. It was referred to a number of parliamentary committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result, a number of amendments were made to the 1994 bill. That bill lapsed and now, of course, we have this particular bill, which in many respects is little different from the 1994 bill. If anyone wants evidence to that effect, they can compare the second reading speech of this Attorney&hyphen;General with the second reading speech attached to the bill in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we will give general support to this legislation, but we have some concerns about it. There are some differences between the 1994 bill and the 1996 bill. We have some concerns about this particular bill, and we will be moving some amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first concern is in respect to the definition of a legislative instrument&mdash;what constitutes a legislative instrument. The 1996 bill adopts an inclusive definition. The 1994 bill provided an exhaustive definition. By being inclusive, the 1996 bill generally encompasses instruments that come within the scope of the 1994 bill. However, the 1996 bill requires those instruments to have a `legislative character', whereas the 1994 bill merely required them to be `binding in their application'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the 1996 bill is less precise in its application, the definition is, as I said, broadly consistent with the intent of the 1994 bill and, to the extent that there is a discrepancy between the bills, the 1996 bill is likely to capture a broader range of instruments than the former one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some concerns that this broader and less precise definition may give rise to  potentially extensive and expensive litigation as to what is or what is not a legislative instrument. As many senators would know, the legal textbooks are littered with cases that have sought to clarify this often very fine and technical distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not wish to see necessary dedicated legislation frustrated as a result of such litigation. Further, the costs of such litigation will be borne not only by government but by those that the government claims it wants to assist, and particularly small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about this, and this particular extension to the definition, but we do say at this stage that this matter is one that will be monitored by us and will be highlighted as a key issue for examination when the bill is reviewed in three years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now move to the first of our amendments, which goes to the question of Attorney&hyphen;General's certificates. The 1996 bill picks up a provision of the 1994 bill which allows the Attorney to issue a certificate to the effect that an instrument is not legislative in character. The 1994 bill provided for parliamentary review and disallowance of decisions by the Attorney&hyphen;General so certifying. It excluded review, including under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The 1996 bill removes the ability for parliament to review the decision but makes it subject to judicial review under the AD(JR) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the 1994 bill recommended that parliamentary review be maintained. This report and recommendation has been supported by some government backbenchers, including Senator O'Chee, who was then Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the difficult legal issues surrounding whether an instrument is legislative in character, the Labor Party believes that it would be inappropriate to leave these matters for judicial review alone. We believe this because, firstly, what we are concerned about here is an expression by parliament as to the character of an instrument having force in its own 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right. We recognise that the history of the legislative executive distinction is as much one of practice as it is of settled law, and that to remove the legislature from this evolving process is to ignore the history of the development of common law in this area. We think the parliament does have a role to play in the actual characterisation of the instruments that we are talking about and, as a consequence, that it should maintain an interest and role in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we recognise that judicial review of a decision by the Attorney may be costly. It will be inaccessible, and will become even more costly and inaccessible, particularly for ordinary Australians to pursue a particular decision. Parliamentary review, of course, provides another avenue for consideration of this decision and, more often than not, it is a less costly one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney has argued that parliamentary review may be inappropriate as the issue is ultimately one for judicial determination. But, let's face it, a lot of the decisions that we are taking here could ultimately be ones for judicial determination, but the parliament does not resile from having a role to play in respect of so many decisions that could and do ultimately flow on to the judicial parts of our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under our proposal, it is likely that it would be the Attorney of the day and not an individual citizen who would be most likely to challenge such a determination by the parliament. For practical or political reasons, the Attorney might elect not to do so. An Attorney, of course, would want to be reasonably sure of his or her prospects of success before incurring the cost of such a legal challenge. We think it is better if such a dispute be resolved wherever possible between the arms of government rather than having ordinary citizens put to the expense of a legal challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, in this context, that the 1994 bill expressly excluded judicial review of a certificate issued by the Attorney. The House of Representatives standing committee review of the legislation rightly pointed out the anomaly that, whilst the review of the AD(JR) Act was not available, the bill did not exclude review 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6805"> of a decision to issue a certificate pursuant to a prerogative writ under the  original jurisdiction of the High Court or section 39B of the Judiciary Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In retrospect, we did have an unsatisfactory situation in the 1994 bill, and it was a situation which acted as an unnecessary barrier to the legitimate challenge to the validity of these certificates. As I have said, we are moving these amendments today not only to support the inclusion of the ADJR review but also to maintain parliamentary review of an Attorney&hyphen;General's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now move on to consultation coverage. The 1996 bill extends the range of instruments upon which consultation must be sought so as to include not only those legislative instruments which directly affect business but also those which have a significant indirect effect on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the 1994 bill limited the application of the consultation mechanism to legislative instruments that had a direct effect. The limitation was proposed so that time could be given to assess the effectiveness of consultation mechanisms before consideration was actually given to extending the range of legislative instruments to which they apply. The 1996 bill is not inconsistent with that approach, although it is undoubtedly more adventurous, and we support these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the consultation process, part 3 of the 1996 bill proposes a two&hyphen;stage review process overseen by the prescribed regulatory review body, which I understand will be the Office of Regulation and Review. This body must certify the adequacy of consultation on a legislative instrument. The first stage requires that comment be sought from representative bodies of those affected. This is to be conducted prior to development of the legislative instrument. The second stage requires public advertisement and occurs after the legislative instrument is developed. The 1996 bill also makes consultation decisions subject to review under the AD(JR) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process will be considerably more onerous than the one&hyphen;stage post&hyphen;development consultation process required under the 1994 bill. The 1994 bill excluded ADJR review of the consultation process. Whilst this process 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is more onerous, it is submitted on our part that it should be supported as representing best practice. However, ADJR review of that mechanism could&mdash;and we should note this&mdash;be used by any organised lobby as a means to frustrate the making of necessary legislative instruments. I think the government should bear this in mind as their legislation takes effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, it is noted that the ability to frustrate the development of an instrument is somewhat more limited because of a failure to consult in compliance with part 3 of the bill, but does not affect the ultimate validity of a legislative instrument. Notwithstanding this, I think it is fair to say that the ability to frustrate the development of an instrument by this means should not be understated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As noted, the 1994 bill excluded ADJR review of the consultation process. However, such a provision would not prevent judicial review of that process because of the availability of common law administration review, which is, of course, protected through the original jurisdiction of the High Court under the constitution and section 39B of the Judiciary Act. We do have some concerns with this particular proposal but, as I said earlier, we will not be opposing these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move now to the second set of Labor amendments: Labor amendment 5 which goes to the legislative instrument proposal. The 1996 bill generally widens the information that must be included in a legislative instrument proposal. The so&hyphen;called LIP will now contain a fuller analysis of the options available to achieve the purpose underlying a legislative instrument and the relative merits of alternative approaches. A LIP is required to take into account the indirect social and economic costs and benefits of a proposal. However, in detailing an inclusive list of matters that need to be taken into account, the government has not listed environmental matters, as were listed in the 1994 legislation. I note that this particular change does not necessarily exclude the consideration of environmental matters but is symbolically very significant. It is another indication that this government does not take environmental and social concerns as seriously as it should.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6806">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the parliament should explicitly refer to environmental concerns as a matter to  be taken into account in the drawing up of a legislative instrument proposal. As a consequence, our amendment will not limit the generality of other matters that a decision maker may decide to take into account but will explicitly include environmental matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area where we have proposed amendments is consultation exemptions. Here there are a number of changes between the 1994 bill and the 1996 bill on the range of matters for which exemption from consultation may be granted. For instance, the 1996 bill does not provide for exemptions where, one, a legislative instrument is required urgently, two, significant or comparable public consultation on the instrument has already occurred, three, notice of the instrument would give an unfair advantage to particular individuals and, four, the Attorney&hyphen;General certifies that public consultation would not be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, the 1996 bill does provide for a range of exemptions where, for instance, the instrument is required in the interests of national security, in which case no certification by the Attorney&hyphen;General is required. The instrument is an airworthiness directive. The instrument is a commencement proclamation. The decision maker proposes to make a 12&hyphen;month temporary legislative instrument or the regulatory review body certifies that the LIP is adequate and otherwise waives part 3 consultation requirements where no such consultation is required by the enabling legislation, or agreement is comparable, or the costs of complying with part 3 outweigh the benefits to be obtained by the instrument. We believe that the 1996 bill is too restrictive in some cases and is open for abuse in others. Accordingly, we propose an alternative regime that accepts a number of the above changes whilst modifying others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we believe that an exemption should be available where the instrument is urgently required or where notice would give an unfair advantage to individuals. However, such an instrument should only have a 12&hyphen;month temporary operation and should be certified 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the regulatory review body as being necessary. Secondly, the exemptions for prior, significant or comparable public consultation should be retained, but we believe there should be a requirement that the regulatory review body certify that such consultation has indeed taken place. This will provide a central checking mechanism, thereby helping to prevent errant departments from getting around the consultation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the public interest tests, we believe, should be retained, thus eliminating the need for specific national security and airworthiness exemptions. In our amendment, we have included both these matters in a list of matters included within but not limiting the public interest test. We are concerned that, given the broad effect of this bill on legislative instruments, we do not wish to prejudice matters for which the public interest would militate against consultation pursuant to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, we do support the exemption of commencement proclamations and, fifthly, the exemption for 12&hyphen;month temporary instruments should otherwise be removed. There should be no need beyond those that I have already outlined for a temporary legislative instrument to be created. A provision of this nature is, we believe, open to widespread abuse. Finally, we believe the power of the regulatory review body to limit the consultation required should be retained as set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have further amendments, for instance in respect to disallowance exemptions. The 1996 bill disallowance exemptions are similar to those contained in the 1994 bill, with three exceptions. These are three additional types of instruments which they exempt. They are certificates by the attorney extending the sunset period, proclamations under section 5 of the Flags Act and proclamations made under the Quarantine Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the exemptions of the Attorney&hyphen;General's certificates. The exemption for proclamations under section 5 of the Flags Act will also be supported. However, in respect of the Quarantine Act, it is actually unclear as to why legislative instruments should be exempted from disallowance in this respect. The breach of such proclamations can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6807"> give rise to considerable criminal penalties and we believe should not be included. In doing so, we note the view of Senator O'Chee  who agrees with us in respect to this. Both Senator O'Chee and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills have raised concerns about the exclusion from disallowance of legislative instruments that arise under a national scheme of legislation. A similar exemption was contained in the 1994 bill. We believe that this exemption should, however, remain and we accept the government's position here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Early backcapturing is another area where we support the government but, in respect of non&hyphen;legislative instruments and sunsetting, we do have a range of amendments. I do not think there is enough time for me to go through them at this particular stage, but I could speak to those in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, as I said at the outset, we support the introduction of the bill. We have a number of amendments to it. Much of the bill is similar to the bill introduced in 1994. We believe some of the amendments the government has made can be supported at this stage but, as I have set out to explain in a number of areas, we do have concerns. We will be moving amendments in accordance with the statements I have made in this particular stage of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish here. I do not know whether it is opportune for us to go back to the previous legislation. Senator Brown is not in the chamber, so maybe it is not. Maybe we can continue with the second reading debate of this bill and return to the telecommunications interception bill later on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A key component of the rule of law is accessibility to those rules, consistency in their application and transparency and control over their development. Last Friday, Chief Justice Brennan in his `State of the judicature' address stated the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to be governed by the rule of law, we must have a judicature to administer it. The characteristics of that Judicature reflect the functions it is charged to perform. First, it must be a Judicature that is and is seen to be impartial, independent of government and of any other centre of financial or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> social power, incorruptible by prospects of reward or personal advancement and fearless in applying the law irrespective of popular acclaim or criticism. Second, it must be a competent Judicature: there must be judges and practitioners who know the law and its purpose, who are alive to the connection between abstract legal principle and its practical effect, who accept and observe the limitations on judicial power and who, within those limitations, develop or assist in developing the law to answer the needs of society from time to time. Third, it must be a judicature that has the confidence of the people, without which it loses its authority and thereby loses its ability to perform its functions. Fourth, it must be a judicature that is reasonably accessible to those who have a genuine need for its remedies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Democrats wish to associate themselves with the sentiments expressed by Chief Justice Brennan and indeed with the whole tenor of his speech delivered in Melbourne last Friday. The learned chief justice has, I believe, touched on many of the values which should underpin the bill we are about to debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us today represents a significant improvement in the law&hyphen;making processes of this country. I wish to publicly commend the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and this government for its introduction. I know it has a long cross-party history in its development and this government is now bringing it in. I and my party commend you for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the bill seeks to reform the procedures for making, scrutinising, publishing, amending and repealing subordinate legislation&mdash;in effect, the machinery of Australian government. It will do this by defining more clearly and comprehensively the forms of subordinate legislation subject to parliamentary review and disallowance; establishing a single register of delegated legislation with legislative instruments only being enforceable if they are on the register; introducing public notice and consultation procedures for changes to delegated legislation affecting business; providing for the backcapture of existing subordinate legislation and placement on the register; introducing automatic sunsetting provisions requiring all legislative instruments to be reviewed every five years; providing parliamentary scrutiny of all forms of delegated legislation with each 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6808"> instrument to be tabled in each house of parliament within six days of registration; and, hopefully, providing a major incentive for the other eight governments in Australia  to follow suit. That is of profound importance to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Australian Democrats do have concern with allowing the Attorney-General to issue a certificate in specified circumstances to clarify the nature of an instrument. By far though, in the main, the Democrats applaud these initiatives and will be supporting the bulk of the bill. However, we are concerned that the efficacy of the bill and the all&hyphen;important principles underlying it will be unnecessarily undermined by those exemptions and qualifications the government has put in, and we think that the amendments before the Senate should in fact improve that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Having praised you, however, I must focus in my speech on the second reading on our main areas of concern. The first I have already mentioned, and that is the certification by the Attorney-General. The ability of the Attorney-General to certify whether an instrument is legislative or not means that, if the Attorney&hyphen;General certifies that an instrument is not legislative, parliament has no powers at all to deal with the instrument. As Senator O'Chee, who is a recognised parliamentary authority on these matters, pointed out in his report, this will mean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the executive can then make laws it likes under that particular provision without Parliament even knowing, far less having the opportunity to disallow the instrument.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this power represents a serious diminution of the rights of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an exceptionally serious statement to make, particularly by a member of the government. Senator O'Chee is, in this instance, spot on. In view of his comments, we will then be pleased to receive his support when a division is called on those amendments that will mitigate his concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our next concern relates to national schemes of legislation. Last year's working party of representatives of scrutiny of legislation committees throughout Australia conclud 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed that `effective parliamentary scrutiny has been threatened by the rise of national schemes of legislation which emerged from bodies such as COAG and various ministerial councils'. These schemes are becoming increasingly important and it is appropriate that parliament be able to scrutinise such instruments. Therefore, we look forward to those amendments which deal with national schemes of legislation. I think that is in Senator Colston's amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that the bill excludes quarantine act proclamations from disallowance, although not from tabling. This exemption was introduced in the House of Representatives as a government amendment. Senator O'Chee argues that, as breaches of these proclamations incur serious penalties, they should be subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our next concern is the bill does not apply to instruments providing for the terms and conditions of Commonwealth employees. It is intended that those instruments will not even be tabled in parliament. This exemption includes determinations from the Remuneration Tribunal which at present are subject to full parliamentary allowance or disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our next concern is the bill's formal consultation process will apply only to matters affecting business. This bill sets up a fairly extensive formal consultation process for legislative instruments `likely to have a direct, or substantial indirect, effect on business'. The bill lists the enabling legislation to which this process will apply. Other legislative instruments will be subject to the same process only `if the rule&hyphen;maker considers that the procedures are appropriate', which seems to be a quite wide discretion granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this is an unnecessary bias in favour of consulting with business. Some crucial pieces of enabling legislation are conspicuous by their absence from the bill&mdash;the Social Security Act, for example. It should be noted, however, that many major pieces of enabling legislation dealing with the environment are included in the bill, presumably on the basis of their impact upon business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultation is specifically not required under the bill where the instrument is not likely to have an effect on business. Instru 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6809"> ments which give effect to the following specific budget decisions are also expressly excluded from the consultation process, such as decisions proposing to repeal, impose or  adjust a tax, fee or charge, decisions proposing to confer, revoke or alter an entitlement or decisions proposing to impose, revoke or alter an obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains no power to amend legislative instruments. We think that is a concern. The inability of the Senate to amend regulations or disallowance instruments has been a source of frustration for the Democrats. This bill does not alter that situation sufficiently and we believe still frustrates the effective role of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may sound a dry topic to those who are listening, but I remind them that these instruments affect Australians as much as laws do, and maybe more so in cases. There are over 100 different types of legislative instruments in Australia. Australians are inextricably subjected to literally thousands of pieces, rules, regulations and ministerial decisions which permeate their daily lives. We have come to call these rules and regulations delegated or subordinated legislation. We need them. There is a very good reason for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament is the supreme law making authority in this country. It is charged not only with making laws but also with supervising and scrutinising those powers it bestows on the executive arm of government, on the administration of government and on the executive's instrumentalities for it is the parliament, notably the Senate, which represents the people and holds the executive accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As any member of parliament and as any senator will attest, the sheer volume of delegated legislation&mdash;in recent years that volume has been considerable&mdash;has meant that a number of democratic concerns need to be restated and in some instances reinvigorated. When I speak of democratic concerns, I refer to the long&hyphen;held belief of the Australian Democrats that the continued legitimacy of government in this country can be maintained only if we get progressive, participative, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representative democracy and if the essentials of democracy are adhered to. In the broadest terms, this means that the laws the citizens of this country are subject to must be accessible by them and must be subject to parliament's purview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a seminar in 1990 conducted by the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department it was suggested that all subordinate legislation was in effect secret or hidden legislation due to the fact that it does not usually enter the public arena until after it has come into force. The government is attempting to address this. As I said, we do welcome the government's efforts in this regard. Clearly, the pile of red tape that ensues with regulations may have the effect of burying and concealing the laws to which citizens are subject. In any event, inaccessibility does not enhance the operation of the rule of law in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to flag that the Democrats will be moving amendments with regard to gender&hyphen;specific and relationship&hyphen;specific language. As I have said in previous debates, the Democrats are of the view that the time has long past in public discourse and especially in the letter of the law when sexist or relationship specific language could be used. The effect would be to discriminate and to disenfranchise sections of the Australian community. Our amendments will reflect a non-gender&hyphen;specific and non-relationship&hyphen;specific requirement in the registration of future legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Senate will be supporting our amendments. I flag to those parties who have put up amendments&mdash;the government, the Labor Party, Senator Colston and others&mdash;that we are likely to be supporting the bulk of those.</PARA></SPEECH>

The chairperson of that committee tabled a report in the Senate on 21 November 1996. The committee has produced a good analysis of the benefits and shortcomings of the proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6810">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator O'Chee indicated in his report, the changed procedures in this bill generally improve the ability of parliament to scrutinise delegated legislation. This is to be both  applauded and encouraged. As always, however, there are some concerns in relation to certain aspects of the bill as it currently stands. I will discuss some of these key issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I have a great concern about clause 8 in Part 1 of the bill which provides the Attorney&hyphen;General with the ability to effectively exempt certain regulations from parliamentary scrutiny. Senator O'Chee has been oft quoted so far in this debate, so I will continue the trend. He stated in his report on this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Attorney certifies that the instrument is not legislative then parliament has no powers at all in respect to that instrument.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Murray indicated then that the executive would be able to make any laws without parliament even knowing. Senator O'Chee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power of the Attorney to give conclusive certificates, reviewable only in the procedural formalities, is a serious diminution of the rights of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have to understand here that this is not just a technical issue. There may well be a case where the nature of these instruments becomes an increasing problem. We have seen the figures from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>  which indicate that we have got a growth from 1982&hyphen;1991 of 703 to 1,645 instruments, so it is a growing problem. We may well have, at some stage, a High Court challenge on the nature of law making and the nature of the separation of powers. It is not a fanciful scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that happened, the problems we are having between the states and the Commonwealth government in relation to taxes would probably pale into insignificance in relation to all of the laws accompanied by such instruments and the complexity of going to each of the laws and trying to deal with them, if the nature of law making and instrument making is challenged in the High Court at some stage because of the problem with the constitution. Just think of what we could be doing. At this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stage we have to try and avoid a situation where that might happen in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Senator O'Chee's comments in relation to this bill are concerned, I probably could not have said it better myself. I will be moving, in the committee stage of the bill, to oppose clause 8 in part 1 of the bill. Whilst I will be commenting further in the committee stage, it should be noted here that this is one of the most important aspects of the bill. The parliament must have the ability to properly scrutinise the activities and decisions of the executive. Failure to put in place proper mechanisms to facilitate that scrutiny could only be seen as a major attack on democracy in this country. As I say, if at some stage that is challenged in a constitutional manner in the High Court, we are going to have a real problem on our hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I have some concerns in relation to part 3 of this bill which covers consultation before making legislative instruments. I was delighted to see specific acknowledgment of the need to consult before delegated legislation is drafted. However, my optimism was dashed when on further examination I discovered that not only is this consultation limited to legislative instruments likely to have a direct and substantial effect on business, but the proposal is to focus on the social and economic costs and benefits of each such option without consideration of such things as environmental aspects. I will be moving amendments to rectify these limitations. We cannot as a parliament say only certain things require community consultation when we look at the frustration that is already building in the community about such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I am concerned about the provision in clause 61, subclause (7), which prevents the disallowance of legislative instruments in relation to the establishment or operation of an intergovernmental body or a scheme involving the Commonwealth and one or more states. Again, as Senator O'Chee stated in his report to the Senate, these schemes which involve the Commonwealth and states and territories are likely to become more important and it would seem to be quite fundamental that parliament should scrutinise this legislation. I will be moving to have this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6811"> subclause deleted during the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause (8) of clause 61 also contains an exemption from disallowance with respect to  proclamations under certain sections of the Quarantine Act 1908. There appears to be no rational explanation for the decision to provide this particular exemption and consequently I will also be moving to oppose this subclause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I am concerned that certain instruments in relation to the terms and conditions of employment of persons employed by the Commonwealth, by Commonwealth statutory authorities or by government business enterprises, or as members of the Defence force or the Australian Federal Police, are to be incorporated in this bill as instruments that are not legislative instruments and consequently not disallowable by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving to oppose this provision in schedule 1 of the bill during the committee stage. It is a very dangerous thing, if you think about the current situation where more and more of what we do in parliament ends up being confused with business commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, more and more outsourcing, and so on. The parliamentary scrutiny must remain in relation to such things and the independence of the Public Service must be maintained. It is very important and should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, therefore, I wish to restate the commitment of the Greens to the principle that the parliament has the right and the responsibility to properly scrutinise the activities and decisions of the executive. Delegated legislation is a reality in modern public administration and unfortunately, as I mentioned before, an increasing reality. The increasing level of delegated legislation has created the necessity for better systems and structure for the proper scrutiny of these instruments, not worse. I trust that the Senate will agree to the amendments that I have foreshadowed and that I notice other honourable senators have foreshadowed in order to facilitate that scrutiny.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The title of the bill that the Senate is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussing at the moment is the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF> . That is enough to turn anybody off and people can go to sleep. But it is a very important piece of legislation because, at the least, it goes to the very heart of the separation of powers between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. It is very  important. I have said this year after year after year: it is most important that parliament does have proper oversight of executive government actions. That is part of our democracy. It is not proper for unelected persons to determine, without reference to parliament, issues which are legislative in character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to deliver a speech to the Senate on behalf of Senator Colston, who would have dearly liked to have been here today. He has had a longstanding interest and commitment to the work of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He was a chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee on two occasions for more than three years and deputy chairman since the 1996 election. He is able to speak with deep knowledge about the issues involved. Under those circumstances, it is my privilege to express his views to the Senate, which happen also to be mine and happen to be those generally of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Regulations and Ordinances Committee is the committee which, on behalf of the rest of us in the Senate, scrutinises legislative instruments to ensure that they comply with the highest standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights. The committee's annual reports and other reports to the Senate indicate that it has experienced considerable success in improving the quality of legislative instruments. Laws made by the executive under the authority of a parliamentary enactment can have the same effect upon individuals as the provisions in their enabling act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the effect upon individual members of the public may be more immediate because the parent act will often set out only the broad principles of a legislative scheme while the actual administrative details are filled in by legislative instruments made by ministers or by public servants. Let me say that this is no reflection on the work of public servants 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6812"> in this regard. They have a very important and onerous task to perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of this either immediate or long-term effect on individuals, it is important that any relevant umbrella legislation, such as the  present Legislative Instruments Bill, should include the widest and strongest provisions for parliamentary scrutiny of these instruments. The existing provisions relating to legislative instruments are covered by only six pages of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and three pages of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. On the other hand, the bill that is currently before us is 113 pages long. Perhaps the most important question now is whether the rights of parliament and, therefore, the people are protected adequately by the proposed new scheme and whether the tenfold increase in statutory provision does not include any measures which dilute, diminish or otherwise derogate from those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, Senator Colston, who prepared this second reading stage speech, recalled that the previous 1994 version of this bill provided that only the whole of a regulation could be disallowed. Under that bill, it would not have been possible to disallow a single provision of an instrument. This serious reduction in the power of the parliament was fortunately detected by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and has now been rectified in the current bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee does not oppose the bill. The chairman of the committee, Senator O'Chee, has to run around the course here today. I must say that I have read Senator O'Chee's speeches to the various fora on the particular areas, and I was most impressed. In respect of the current bill, Senator O'Chee reported to the Senate on 21 November 1996 and 23 June 1997 that the bill would generally improve parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee also pointed out, however, that there are several areas where the bill unacceptably removes from parliament what should be its natural and appropriate powers in respect of supervision of these instruments. Senator O'Chee's statements described these areas of concern and Senator Colston had circulated amendments which addressed these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns and which the committee believes may be necessary to preserve the legislative supremacy of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most disturbing areas of concern is provisions in the bill and circulated government amendments which would remove from the operation of the bill instruments in respect of employment by the Commonwealth. These instruments include Remuneration Tribunal determinations and determinations at present made under the Public Service Act and the Defence Act. At present, these instruments are subject to varying degrees of parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In expanding further on these classes of instruments, Senator Colston has given some instances of problems which the committee has found. Remuneration Tribunal determinations set terms and conditions of employment for ministers, judges, senators, members of the House of Representatives, Public Service secretaries and heads and members of government statutory authorities. Under the government amendments, these determinations would not be subject to full parliamentary control. In addition, Public Service determinations and Defence determinations provide for allowances and other conditions of service for scores of thousands of Commonwealth public servants and members of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Regulations and Ordinances Committee has in fact extracted some concessions from the government in respect of these instruments. The problem is that the government amendments relate to specific provisions which are likely to disappear with the proposed repeal of the present Public Service Act. I think that is an important question which we would need to consider in the committee stage. If this happens there will be no scrutiny at all of these instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government amendments also give some concessions in respect of the Remuneration Tribunal determinations but these are still excluded from the bill. The minister has informed the committee that the reason for this is that it would be `unfair', to use the minister's words, to expect the upper levels of Commonwealth employment to be subject to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6813"> the full vigour of parliamentary scrutiny. My amendments will provide for legislative instruments affecting Commonwealth employment to be subject to the bill. When I say `my amendments', I mean Senator Colston's amendments, which I will be moving. I notice  that one or two of them are similar to one or two of the opposition's amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now give some details of actual industrial relations type instruments scrutinised by the committee. One such case which was the subject of a special report to the Senate involved the rights of Commonwealth public servants. Our late colleague Senator Olive Zakharov took an extremely close interest in this particular case. An official of the Department of Industrial Relations, with no meaningful consultation with those affected, made a determination which entrenched an injustice for some 30,000 members of the Australian Public Service. Also, the explanatory statement for the determination did not describe its nature or effect. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee ascertained that the official had made the determination in defiance of a recent report by the Merit Protection and Review Agency which advised that the position was unfair, inequitable and obviously anomalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questioned by the late Senator Zakharov during a meeting with the committee, departmental officials revealed that they had known of the injustice for almost 20 years. I am pleased that this matter had a relatively satisfactory conclusion, with the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance agreeing to a one&hyphen;line budget appropriation of $4.1 million to right the injustice. This case underscores that it is essential that the Senate, through the committee, continues to scrutinise these instruments and that the bill should provide for this. Thus the Senate was not only exercising its audit and control function over executive government decisions but it was exercising its important function to uphold the rights  of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has experienced many other problems with instruments of this type, almost all of which were made or supervised by officials of the Department of Industrial Relations. The committee has scrutinised 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Remuneration Tribunal determinations and Defence determinations which were void for invalid subdelegation; Defence and Public Service determinations void for prejudicial retrospectivity; a Public Service determination void because its drafting did not reflects legislative intent; and Defence and Public Service determinations where the maker did not comply with the requirements of the enabling act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One Public Service determination had a corrigendum attached with sticky tape, while another had handwritten alterations with no initials, date or any other identifying mark. Another was neither signed nor dated. In respect of one Remuneration Tribunal determination the minister advised the committee that, on the one hand, it could be considered invalid while, on the other hand, it could be valid. These are all problems of validity. As well, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has found problems with the substantive provisions of many of these instruments. The committee therefore believes that it is important for the Senate to continue its supervision of this type of instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this brief outline that I have presented to the Senate on behalf of Senator Colston I have dealt with only one type of delegated legislation, namely, instruments dealing with the terms and conditions of Commonwealth employees. I know that honourable senators will consider these matters carefully, as they have always done in respect of this very important function of the Senate which deals with the rights and privileges of individuals and the rights and responsibilities and privileges of the Senate in respect of audit and control of executive government decisions and upholding individual rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a number of amendments but, as other honourable senators said, the government should be commended for bringing forward the bill. There are a number of amendments that Senator Colston would like the committee to consider. The bill in general makes important changes to the ability of the Senate to scrutinise and, if the Senate wishes, to disallow legislative instruments. Many of the changes are beneficial. I do commend the government in respect of that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6814">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will enhance the power of the Senate to supervise and control legislative instruments made by the executive. The beneficial changes include: an increase in the number and types of instruments subject to tabling and disallowance, many of which at  present have no parliamentary oversight at all; legislative instruments to be tabled within six days instead of the present 15 days; statutory requirement to table explanatory statements; power to postpone disallowance motions for up to six months; backcapturing and sunsetting of legislative instruments, which will ensure continuing parliamentary review of legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also benefit the public by greater availability and access to legislative instruments and benefit the business community by mandatory consultation and impact assessment. The general thrust of the bill, therefore, will improve the position of the parliament and the public in relation to legislative instruments. Unfortunately, however, the bill includes a number of provisions which will diminish the role of the parliament in the new scheme, and it is these defects which Senator Colston's amendments and others that will be moved will address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we and the committee see it, there are four important defects in the bill. The bill provides for the Attorney-General to issue conclusive certificates as to whether a particular instrument is or is not legislative. Obviously, that is not a goer, and everybody knows it is not a goer. All we will have to do is say that those particular certificates should be subject to disallowance and that fixes that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill excludes instruments which provide for national schemes of legislation&mdash;such as Corporations Law, the competition code, road transport reform and occupational, health and safety&mdash;from parliamentary disallowance. These schemes are likely to become more important, and it is inappropriate that parliament should not be able to scrutinise this legislation. Parliament should have the same option of disallowance of the instruments as it has over other legislative instruments, many of which are of far less consequence than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national schemes. We are hearing more and more of national schemes, and I have the distinct feeling, which is supported in rather more technical terms by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, that we are tending to lose control of those situations on behalf of those persons who elect us here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill excludes Quarantine Act declarations from disallowance. These declarations, which could severely disrupt the activities of individuals and businesses, provide for penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000. The reason for excluding the declarations from parliamentary scrutiny is apparently that they are important and sensitive. This is, however, a reason in favour of disallowance, rather than the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth major defect of the bill&mdash;an important defect in the bill, as the committee sees it&mdash;is that the bill at present provides expressly that regulations may exclude instruments providing for Commonwealth public sector conditions of employment from any parliamentary scrutiny at all. Following correspondence with the regulations and ordinances committee, the government has circulated amendments which go part of the way towards addressing this deficiency but in other ways makes the position worse. The amendments that will be moved by me on behalf of Senator Colston provide for full parliamentary scrutiny of these instruments and possible disallowance by either House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into the details of it now as it is more appropriate to deal with those at the committee stage, but I do thank the work that has been done by the members of the regulations and ordinances committee over many years, including the fine work that Senator Colston has done on that committee. I do thank those members for continuing to work on behalf of the Senate in the best interests of

In that context, since this bill has had its genesis over two governments of different colours, I congratulate the administrative laws branch of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, which has had the carriage of this legislation for some time now and has brought it forward to its present state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very good bill and, as speeches have indicated so far, it can be made better, and debate no doubt will ensure that it is made better. There are two matters which I will comment on later, if time arises&mdash;that is, the issue of the national schemes legislation and the issue of conclusive certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does, as Senator Harradine pointed out, seem a dry subject because it deals with process. Process is the means by which particular things are worked out so that a result is obtained from a beginning. A legal system depends upon process&mdash;the issuing of writs, the serving of a defence, the serving of interrogatories on the other side and discovery. It has probably changed since I was in the profession but, nevertheless, the issue of process is very important because it ensures that a right and fair result is obtained where it would not otherwise occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Process tends to be dry because you have to take step by step the journey you are going to go on. People like to get to the end of the journey suddenly. But process is a matter that is essential for the proper operation of our courts and it is essential for the proper operation of this place, the parliament. Parliament is still, in theory at least, the dominant force in this society and the force that ensures that fairness, that justice, that proper process, is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, parliament has become dominated by the executive. Mr Justice Brennan&mdash;as he then was; he is now the Chief Justice of the High Court&mdash;made that point 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very powerfully on 7 August 1990 in his Blackburn Lecture. I will quote Mr Justice Brennan because it is very pertinent to the present debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The theory of responsible government which made the fate of an Executive Government dependent upon the confidence of the Parliament was, so to speak, turned on its head by the political dependence of the majority members of the Parliament on the Executive Government. Policy formulation became primarily an executive function. As the pressure on legislative time intensified a virtual monopoly over initiatives for legislation passed to the Executive Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later in the speech, His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the wind of political expediency now chills Parliament's willingness to impose checks on the Executive and the Executive now has a large measure of control over legislation, the courts alone retain their original function of standing between government and the governed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think there is a lot of truth in what he says. What he is saying is that, in reality, parliament does not provide as good a check over the executive as might be desirable. That is a bad thing for democracy. That is what this bill that is before us today goes to remedying to some degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say in passing that His Honour was talking about the duty of the court to ensure that the proper operation of government, in the sense of the three arms of government, continues. It has been worrying to see in recent times how much the courts have been under attack because the courts, like parliament, like the executive itself, are necessary for us to live in a good society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that we the parliament, as one of the three arms of government, gave weight not only to the executive, which we do through the party system, but also to the courts. I think it is time that we as parliamentarians emphasised more and more the need for the courts to remain independent, the need for the courts to be attacked, yes, but attacked only in a proper way and attacked only in a fair way. Some of the attacks on the court that have been going on in recent times have been beyond that limit which is necessary to ensure that we have a proper government and a proper functioning society in this community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6816">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I take this opportunity, as I hope others will over the Spring session, to ensure that the courts are vindicated. As the Chief Justice says, the courts do not have the ability to defend themselves as we in this chamber have the ability to defend ourselves. In any event, that would be a bad thing. Once the courts start taking on a partisan position&mdash;partisan in the sense of having to defend themselves from  attack&mdash;then this very delicate system&mdash;and it is a very delicate system&mdash;begins to diminish. We should not see any of our great instruments of government diminished. They are parts of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about democracy, of course, is that democracy is not efficient. Democracy is not the recent outcome of competition and it is not found in the marketplace. That is the problem: efficiency and competition and the marketplace are the gods of the moment. I think the difficulty we have with the way we are going round our social functioning at the moment is that we measure everything in those terms. We say, `Well, the courts and the parliament are not efficient. They don't enter into competition as they should, and they don't allow the marketplace to operate.' Of course they do not. If we allow these great pillars of society in which we live to diminish in any way, then we are in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996  is doing is establishing a relationship between the executive and the parliament which will lead to greater fairness. As I said, there are things in it that are capable of improvement, and I hope those improvements will take place. This is not, in a sense, a party political debate because I think both parties have agreed that a bill like this ought to be brought forward and enacted. I think it is a debate that concerns our concept of what we ought to do as parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has mentioned the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances&mdash;a committee that will have the most to do with this act. It has been a great committee over the years, and there have been some great people on it. In fact, I think the original idea of this bill came from some thinking by Senator Bob Collins, and it has been taken on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> since then. Senator Harradine has mentioned Senator Colston, and it would be ungracious not to mention him in this context, as well as everybody who has spoken so far. I know Senator Murray has a great appetite for seeing that the balance in society is such as to produce a good society. Senator Bolkus, the person leading off on this debate, has pointed out the opposition's position on this. Again, he is a person who has had much to do with establishing right relationships within society over the years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, you yourself have been constant, may I say, in taking up these matters that go to the democracy we live in and these issues of process. And if process is not there, you will not have a democratic system operating, because the way things are done is crucial to the proper outcomes that we need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of national legislation is one that I do not think has been dealt with in the right way in this bill, because that is going to be excluded from the consideration of the parliamentary committees. Senator Bill O'Chee has done much work in this area, and so have people from the parliaments all around Australia. I think that that is an area that parliament must keep a part in, because it is going to become an area where more and more legislation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody knows what it is all about, but I will just put forward what happens. The various parliaments around Australia and the federal parliament itself come to agreement about certain issues. For example, the Corporations Law, which governs how companies operate in Australia, is the result of national legislation. So is much of the legislation that deals with censorship. It is going to become more and more apparent that this legislation is apposite and that therefore it will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proper that parliaments around Australia have a say in this, particularly when that national legislation is going to be subordinate legislation, that is, legislation that is not made by parliament but made outside parliament by people who are unelected&mdash;as the expression 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6817"> has been used, not in any derogatory sense but as a matter of fact. It would be wrong and a serious flaw in this legislation if it were to go forward and take away the ability of parliament to look at these national schemes of legislation. It is just contradictory in terms. If parliament is the supreme legislative body, then how can it be kept away from some of the most vital areas in which legislation will take place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of a conclusive certificate, that is something that the parliament should not deny itself. We are either responsible as members of parliament or we are not. If we are, then certainly we will be able to treat properly the subordinate legislation that comes before us. If we are not up to it, then we are going to be put out at the next election. After all, that is what democracy is all about: the ballot box. That is the test. If the people of Australia say, `You have treated subordinate legislation in a way that it should not have been treated. You were irresponsible', then the ballot box will decide. We have to have faith in the ballot box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is natural and&mdash;in a certain sense&mdash;proper inclination in the executive to keep things secret, because the executive does have to get things done and does have to be efficient, and it is a nuisance if people are going to supervise, as it were, everything the executive undertakes. But once you start to get to that position and once you start saying, `We'll leave out the process', then you get all sorts of problems. That would be a very bad thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make in this context is the very big issue of how far parliament should be able to look at commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence records. We can look at all sorts of things&mdash;whether we are going to go to war, whether we are going to build hospitals, whether we are going to send people to gaol for breaking the law&mdash;but commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence is beyond that. There is something magic in the phrase `commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence'. It is beyond argument. At estimates committees, people will say, `We will let you have a look at that document about the fact that we are about to sell off a part of Australia, but what we are not going to do is let you see the contract by which we got some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> microphones for the Senate chamber.' Somehow that has got a quality about it which is beyond argument and you cannot have a look at it. I just think that it is absurd, as seen in that statement. If parliament is what we say it is, then there should be an ability to look at that commercial&hyphen;in-confidence stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that parliament should simply ignore the proper rights of the executive, because it is a three&hyphen;tiered system of government and there are rights and powers that the executive should be able to exercise. I am saying that that proper distribution of power between parliament and the executive has been disturbed for a long time, and there is now an attempt to disturb it as between the executive and the courts. The courts are showing a lot more fight than parliament ever did. And so they should, because once the courts become, as it were, browbeaten, then God help us&mdash;and I use that clause advisedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very big issue. We have had money bills, industrial relations bills and Telstra bills coming through&mdash;all of which were of great importance and were paid due regard to&mdash;but this is a bill which raises issues that are as important as, if not more important than, any of those.</PARA></SPEECH>

For that reason, the government continued with this bill, and that is why it is before the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the work done by Senator Colston who has a number of amendments 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6818"> being put to the Senate via, I believe, Senator Harradine, and with his concurrence. Also, I acknowledge the fine work done by Senator O'Chee as chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I do not think people realise just how important the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee is, nor how important is the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee which Senator Cooney chairs. I believe those committees stand as watchdogs for the community in relation to legislation  that comes before the parliament. I believe it is a remarkable task that is carried out by these committees. It is something which is somewhat unique to the Senate and something which is the envy of parliaments of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been the subject of a great deal of scrutiny. It has gone before a number of Senate and other committees and has had the full gaze of members of parliament, senators and expert witnesses. By necessity, the bill has been a compromise in relation to consultation procedures and exemptions, and to the application of consultative procedures to instruments affecting business, as well as to exemptions in certain areas such as quarantine and migration. This bill nonetheless increases significantly the accountability of the executive in the making of regulations and the scrutiny of those regulations. I believe that speakers today have acknowledged that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts the rationale for some of the amendments that have been mentioned today, but the government cannot see its way clear to supporting a number of amendments, and we will be dealing with those amendments and the reasons for the government's course of action during the committee stage. Suffice to say, the government accepts the spirit in which those amendments have been put forward and that really we do have bipartisan or multiparty support for a bill of this sort, and that a bill of this sort will go to serving the people of this country and the good governance of this country. I believe it appropriate that I reserve comments in relation to the respective amendments to the committee stage.</PARA>

I am making the presumption that it will be voted for by the Democrats. He has raised my hopes that in fact they will vote against the amendments that they have supported, by voting against this bill in the third reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens are very concerned about the implications of breaking the time&hyphen;honoured system whereby no&hyphen;one less than a judge is required to issue a warrant to place a listening device on the phones of citizens. We accept that there are criminal activities that need to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be brought to book and that there are good reasons for judges to issue a warrant to have a listening device placed on a phone to catch criminals. But quite clearly there are major civil liberty implications in a loosening of this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard that there are, on average, two phone taps being applied in Australia per day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. That number is increasing. I am concerned that it will increase rapidly. We need to know that, where legal phone tapping is involved, an extremely good reason has been put&mdash;remember, this is done in secret&mdash;and that there is an adjudicator there who is highly qualified and has the confidence of the community in ascertaining whether the law enforcement authority has good reason for putting a listening device on a citizen's phone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that have been accepted by the committee mean that, for the first time, it will not have to be a federal judge; it can be an Administrative Appeals Tribunal officer who is not a judge. There are 39 of them. What is more, we know from the debate in this committee that judges will be increasingly reticent about being approached to issue a warrant. The obvious conclusion is that not only will AAT officers be available to issue warrants, but also there will be a rapid transfer of applications from judges&mdash;who will increasingly refuse now there is a new option available&mdash;to the AAT officers. We will see a rapid increase in the number of warrants being issued by non judges as the number of warrants issued by judges drops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be next? Is the government going to approach the parliament because of the burden placed on these 39 non judges in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue listening devices and say, `Look, we've now got to go to law court officers'? To make light of it, they might next ask that we accept law students as arbiters on this matter. We cannot make light of this because it is a very serious matter. The least we can do at this stage, with the Democrats having accepted the government's amendments or the government having accepted the Democrats' amendments, is put a review period on it. I hope that we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6820"> will get the support of the Democrats. I thank Senator Bolkus, by the way, for talking over this matter at the outset. I think the least we can do in this place is to put a review period on this two years down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in committee earlier this morning, I asked Senator Ellison if he would give an outline to the committee of the qualifications of those people in the AAT who are not judges but who are going to, inevitably, be asked to issue phone tapping warrants as a result of the amendments to the  legislation which we are dealing with here. I would like to hear what those qualifications are. It should be remembered that, whatever they are, we are in the process now of transferring this extraordinarily important arbitration, as to who should be listened in to and who should not, away from the safety of insisting that it be a judge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I indicate that the government will not be supporting this amendment. The Greens have mentioned a two&hyphen;year sunset clause after which AAT members will no longer be able to issue warrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we have is: who would issue the warrants after that stage? This is the problem that bedevils the whole situation: the judges have said that they will not, as a group, issue these warrants. They have said that they will only do this task whilst there is no alternative arrangement in place. Once there is an alternative arrangement in place, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they will cease issuing warrants and that will be it. What we will have is a problem revisiting us in two years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot support this amendment. It is merely putting off the problem for a period of time, after which we will face the same problem again when the judges say, `We're not taking it back; we're not going to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to qualifications, I understand that Senator Brown's office has been provided with the qualifications of the members of the AAT. I understand that, as at February this year, there were 87 members. That figure could be a little different because I believe there is a more current chart available. Suffice to say that it is in the region of 87, and I am advised that some 54 are not legally qualified. The pool that we are looking at here has a total number of 39. So those who are not qualified are not included in the pool. In relation to a deputy president, section 7 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not be appointed as a Deputy President unless he is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory . . . for not less than 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So that covers that aspect. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not be appointed as a senior member&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of the AAT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unless he:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory and has been so enrolled for not less than 5 years; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> has, in the opinion of the Governor&hyphen;General, special knowledge or skill relevant to the duties of a senior member.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a proviso in relation to a person as a senior member. In relation to those who are appointed as non&hyphen;presidential members&mdash;that is, other than senior members&mdash;the person has to be enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, another federal court or a Supreme Court of a state or territory, and must have had experience of not less than five years at a high level in industry, commerce, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6821"> public administration, industrial relations, the practice of a profession or the service of a government or an authority of government. They must have obtained a tertiary degree, after studies in the field of law, economics, public administration or some other field considered by the Governor&hyphen;General to have substantial relevance; or have, in the opinion of the Governor&hyphen;General, special knowledge or skill in relation to any class of matters in respect of which decisions may be made in the exercise of powers conferred under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So section 7 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act relates to the appointment of members of the AAT. In relation to the pool that the Attorney&hyphen;General will be drawing from, I will just seek advice on that. I will correct the number of members on the AAT that I mentioned previously as I have just received more up to date figures. Those figures are: presidential members, 15; deputy presidents, 10; senior members, 20; and ordinary members, 54. That is a total of 99, so the figure of 87 which I mentioned before was a bit out. This, of course, does not include the President of the AAT. The Attorney&hyphen;General would draw from a pool of only 39, not the whole 99. I am advised that, out of the pool of 39, only one member&mdash;a senior member&mdash;is not legally qualified.</PARA></SPEECH>

The judges are doing it and, in terms of that problem, this has been something which has been floated through the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department for the last four or five years&mdash;which includes the term of the previous government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other thing that needs to be said about this is that we really are talking about a large and fundamental extension from judicial officers of federal jurisdiction to members of the AAT. Without wanting to disparage members of the AAT, we have gone through this debate before, as I said yesterday. I invoked then the fact that the balance was struck in a bipartisan way some 14 years ago. If I were a law enforcement agency, I would be looking to judicial officers to issue these warrants, as opposed to the broader extension that the government has in fact got through this parliament. I would be looking for certainty and predictability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some concern amongst some law enforcement agencies about this measure from the government. Senator Ellison says that this is not good enough and asks, `What will we do in two years time?' There is a fair chance, Senator Ellison, that you will not be making the decision in two years time. There could very well be a change of government and that is something you have to take into account. But two years is long enough for any government to think about what they do if this legislation does lapse in two years time. One option, of course, is to come back here and say, `We will extend it,' and commence the parliament at that stage. Another option is to give the Federal Court some extra resources to do the work that they should be doing and to do it adequately. It is not good enough to drain their resources to give them more work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6822"> to do and then to come in here claiming that there is a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this measure does is, I think, very healthily put the government on notice in respect to a decision taken yesterday which is too broad and really does not balance the protection of innocent people adequately. We passed it yesterday and my real concern last night was that, in giving the government a blank cheque in this matter, we do not and we have not imposed sufficient scrutiny on them as to how it will be administered. Senator Murray tried yesterday, but we did have some practical problems with what he was trying to  do. I understood and supported what he was trying to do but how he was trying to do it created a bit of a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this measure puts the heat on the government to administer the scheme over the next two years and to administer it properly. We would be concerned, for instance, at how the Attorney&hyphen;General was to approach this. The sentiment very strongly of this parliament is that only judges should do it where judges can do it. Some of us have a stronger view than that, but I think it is fair to say that the bottom line of the parliament is that it should be judges first and primarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular measure of a sunset clause keeps the Attorney honest. He has to come up, particularly, with the amendment moved by the Democrats in respect of statistics and produce those statistics to this parliament. He has to show that he has been serious about ensuring that judicial officers have taken a primary role in issuing intercept warrants&mdash;not junior officers and not the juniors amongst the AAT appointments. The best way to ensure that is to keep the government on notice that, unless they administer the scheme properly and fairly and balance considerations of human rights with law enforcement, then they will not get endorsement for this measure in two years time. So I welcome the fact that Senator Brown is moving this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is a problem for the government. Senator Ellison, if you were really serious about this, if you showed some flexibility you would actually be accepting this measure this morning and be moving on to the next item of debate. Two years is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long time for you to think about a matter like this. I know the Attorney&hyphen;General takes a lot of time considering matters and that there is a huge stack in his office, but no&hyphen;one would suggest it would take him two years, if he was still in the job, to consider what to do with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your options are to prove that you have done it properly, to come back here and seek more resources not just for the Federal Police but for the courts. In the meantime, we could get some view of how the scheme has been administered, both from the law enforcement side and from the civil liberties side.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown of the Tasmanian Greens unfortunately misrepresented our position. I hope that is not going to be a characteristic of how you evaluate the procedures and debate. If I can recap, because I am aware you were not involved in the entire debate, every party and every independent within the Senate voted for the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R216">Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  to be considered in the committee stage. The Democrats put up 10 detailed amendments, of which one got through, as amended. Labor put up amendments which had the effect of splitting the bill, with which the Democrats did not agree. We thought the bill should be evaluated in the whole. We have still got to get to the third reading which is the stage when we will decide and indicate whether we are going to vote for or against the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the intercession of Senator Brown has been extremely helpful on amendment 663. We think the sunset clause provision is desirable. I would remind senators that the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, on which both Senator Cooney and I sit, recommended such a procedure but it was the consideration of the parties which have put amendments up in advance of the debate that they should rather take an absolute position otherwise. However, the absolute position has been defeated. So I commend you for your amendment, Senator Brown, and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the government will support this as well because, for the reasons outlined, it is a very good procedure. It is something of a leap into the dark to be going beyond judges for the issuing of warrants to allow the authorities to be able to place a phone tap, a listening device, on the phone lines of citizens. What concerns me again is that the bulk of work in issuing those warrants will be going from the federal judges, where it has always been, to non&hyphen;judges in the Administra tive Appeals Tribunal. We have heard from Senator Ellison for the government that one of those persons in the AAT is not legally qualified. He is not a legal practitioner.</PARA></TALK.START>

Already we have gone from insisting that there be a federal judge arbitrating on whether a warrant&mdash;remember these warrants are sought in secret&mdash;is granted to phone tap Australian phone lines. Now suddenly we are finding that persons issuing warrants will not even have to be legally trained. I find that most alarming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fortunately do not know who the specific members of the AAT are that we are referring to, so I feel free to comment on the principle. It is a very serious matter indeed that the chamber is considering a government request&mdash;I think Senator Murray will agree that this has Democrat endorsement&mdash;that officers of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, at least one of whom we know is not legally qualified, are suddenly being asked to approve secret listening devices being placed on the phones of citizens without their knowledge because there will be legitimate circumstances for doing that in the pursuit of criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Suddenly we go from having an insistence on federal judges to having people without legal qualifications being given that role. I object to that. It is not a light matter; it is a very serious matter. Moreover, the number of requests going to these officers is going to be greater than that which have been going to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the judges, simply because there are far fewer of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this legislation goes through, the judges are going to say, `We now have the out. We are not going to deal with these requests for a warrant to allow phone tapping.' So, suddenly, we are going to have non&hyphen;judges, including one person without any legal qualifications although no doubt well qualified in other ways. Senator Ellison listed those qualifications: you can be qualified in economics, that will do; you can be qualified in some other matter, that will do; you need to have spent five years somewhere on a board or on a committee, that will do&mdash;in other words, almost anything will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be very alarmed about the direction in which this is heading. I feel very concerned about the prospect of these changes getting through the Senate. I feel that even the sunset clause is not going to be enough, but it is the best we can do. That is why the Greens are moving it. I am pleased to hear that the Labor Party and the Democrats are going to support it. It is a vital amendment because a review by this Senate is essential if the government and Democrat majority is to have sway in allowing AAT officers, including nonlegally qualified persons, to be responsible for issuing in secret taps on citizens' phones.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to correct a point that Senator Brown made. He said that non&hyphen;lawyers will be asked to perform this task. That is a misrepresentation of the situation.  Indeed, what Senator Brown has forgotten to say is that the person has to be nominated by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) before that person can have the power to issue a warrant. At the moment, only one of those people in the pool who can be nominated is a nonlegal practitioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking to do with these amendments is avoid gender specific language or relationship assumptions being used in legislative instruments unless they are necessary. For instance, amendment No. 1 gives the definition of gender specific language as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . language that expresses bias in favour of one sex, and which therefore treats the other sex in a discriminatory manner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Plainly, if you were dealing with prostate cancer and you referred to males, that would not be exhibiting bias. I guess we could find some other analogies of that kind. The reason we do so is not an exercise in political correctness; it is an exercise in trying to ensure that significant sections of our society are not annoyed or upset or offended by language which, in the past, may have been regarded as acceptable but is no longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that language is a very potent force. It has been a force of oppression. It is also a force of change. How we use language both in our daily life and in legislation affects the sorts of messages we send about what sort of society we are. I have quoted the American feminist Gloria Steinem before. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New words and phrases are one organic measure of change. They capture transformations of perception, and sometimes of reality itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Into that you can also include getting rid of old words and old biases which no longer exist or are no longer necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Democrats amendment No. 2 concerns relationship assumptions. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in relation to the depiction of marriage&hyphen;like relationships, means language that expresses bias 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6827"> in favour of relationships between persons of the opposite sex and which therefore treats relationships between persons of the same sex in a discriminatory manner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We regard that as unnecessary and undesirable in a modern society. We have deliberately required that the legislative counsel must not register a legislative instrument if the instrument contains any gender specific language or relationship assumptions expressed in the manner I have laid out. I would hope that that is helpful to senators listening to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that previously section 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act was thought to be sufficient because it, in part, states that words importing a gender should include every other gender. This attitude, as exemplified in section 23 of the AIA, has helped perpetuate a culture in law where men are specified to mean and include women. In our view, the  resulting effect has been to contribute to sexism and male domination in law and, therefore, in the spheres of public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To use gender neutral language results in the opposite effect in that no offence can be taken in any quarter and removes a historical bias and discrimination which we think is often present in legislative instruments which refer to persons' relationships. We are particularly trying in this instance to guide those persons who will be devising new regulations, and when the five&hyphen;year period comes up we will have to review regulations which have been couched in old language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are consistent with the Democrats' proposal to have discrimination on the basis of sexuality removed from Commonwealth law. It is unreasonable to disenfranchise persons in same sex relationships and where that distinction is discriminatory and not reasonably necessary to give efficacy to the laws of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, you have me between a rock and a hard place because I have the most profound respect for the draftsperson who exercises our instructions and I have the most profound respect for you, and the two of you disagree. I must tell you that I am quite happy to accept any amendments you may seek to put which would make it clearer. I am careful not to write these things myself because I do not have the experience in parliamentary draftsmanship which is appropriate, and I do take advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer your specific questions, Senator Cooney, I will give you an example I gave earlier. There are times when, I suspect, it may be necessary to use gender specific language, and we cannot envisage all the situations. I used an example of a health situation which may be peculiar to a male or a female. That is not being discriminatory in the negative sense; that is being naturally discriminatory. Consequently, the draftsperson 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6829"> expressed the instruction in the way that we see there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to relationship assumptions, it may be that at times the draftsperson writes a particular instruction presuming that they are referring to heterosexual couples. If it is the intention of government in particular circumstances to provide for heterosexual couples as distinct from same sex couples, we believe they need to be explicit if it is in a non-discriminatory fashion and if it is necessary. But, if it is merely an assumption and the result is it would be unclear to those who thereafter have to deal with the rules and regulations, we thought it was necessary to, once again, express it as we have there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator, Cooney, I will say to you that I am happy to take any improving amendments if you want to put them, because it is the thrust I am after. However, unless you think that what we have before the Senate will really result in a problem, we should proceed as we are. I have received a note  from the draftsperson&mdash;and, as I say, I respect very highly the draftsperson&mdash;and the message is, `Senator Cooney's suggestions are eminently acceptable.' It is up to you, Senator Cooney. You can change the words as you see fit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several elements within the definition which need to be teased out here. There are many people in Australia who have families which do not fit into what might be considered the traditional definition of families, but they may be loving, supportive relationships. They might be extended families; they might be single-parent families; they might be same sex couples with children or without children or whatever. There are many definitions. There could be a number of adults who consider themselves to be a family. There are many people who consider they are a family. Of course, anybody who has studied ethnography or anthropology will realise that every community may have a preferred or a general model for a family, but there has been a whole range of models for families throughout history and throughout culture. So the family can be a whole range of models, even within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we should not be saying necessarily that one model is good and the other model is bad. I do not think anyone is necessarily saying that families do not need support. But you could also ask, when we are talking about families, whether we are talking about a particular type of family or about a range of other models that can and do exist within Australia. These models work for people to give them the support they need. Otherwise we might all end up being an unsupported group in society who become dysfunctional because of the lack of relationships between people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes when we put the dollar above everything else, as we do in many other pieces of legislation, that is what we are assuming: that people will and should operate as individuals. Sometimes I think this traditional idea of the family is part of the kind of dollar society which says you have a proprietorial notion. I am not suggesting Senator Harradine is saying this, by the way, but one of the things coming through in the general debate is that the family can be a proprietorial body. That is another version of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic fundamentalism where the father owns the wife and the children, and everybody else should butt out. So there is a whole lot of debate going on in our society about what a family is and what the support structure is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we know that within the law it is not possible for the family structure of some people to be recognised at the moment in terms of what is considered to be a legally binding marriage and what is not. We know that there are many people who may have a marriage certificate, which means nothing to them, who do not provide love and support for their family, for various reasons. We also know that there are many people in our society who do provide love and support but either do not or cannot obtain the legal document which says they have signed on the dotted line under what is considered to be a legally binding marriage in Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the issue of what is necessary to keep society together and what is currently the norm&mdash;even though the norm might be, in the end, the exception&mdash;needs to be dealt with. I think these kinds of challenges in the legislation do have to be dealt with seriously. They are not about whether people think families are good or bad. They are about whether or not we are open enough to think that a wider definition of what is a family, what is marriage and what is a legitimate relationship should be considered equally and without prejudice in our society.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise as a matter of public interest this afternoon the issue of misuse of parliamentary privilege. Recent instances, both here in this place and in the New South Wales parliament, have generated debate and public controversy. Abuses of privilege have caused many to wonder whether the unqualified right of free speech in parliament ought to be tempered with at least some individual responsibility for members of parliament to ensure their information has a factual basis before embarking on a denunciation of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that parliamentary privilege is an essential underpinning for the proper functioning of a free and democratic society. In Australia, parliamentary immunities and privileges are part of the ordinary law by virtue of section 49 of the constitution. There is a legitimate role for parliamentary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privilege in a democracy and in the public interest to air matters of serious concern that may not otherwise see the light of day because of restrictions such as strict defamation laws or, in more extreme cases, conspiracy to suppress information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been acknowledged that members of parliament misuse privilege from time to time to the detriment of the reputation of individuals. Yet it is steadfastly maintained that the unfettered right of free speech is so important and so immutable that it is impossible to find some principled way of ensuring that parliamentarians exercise free speech responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent events have caused many of us to question whether it is beyond our collective wit to ensure some limited accountability for statements made in parliament which appear to be recklessly indifferent to the truth. I refer, firstly, to events in my own state, the state of New South Wales, and to statements made in the Legislative Council by Mrs Franca Arena MLC concerning the late David Yeldham QC, who killed himself subsequent to Mrs Arena having named him in parliament as being linked to paedophilia activities. Secondly, I refer to statements made by her last week alleging a criminal conspiracy between the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Peter Collins, and Police Royal Commissioner, Justice James Wood, to conceal evidence identifying prominent individuals as being involved in paedophilia activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both episodes were followed by extraordinary events. One of these events, David Yeldham's death, was catastrophic. The other, the setting up of an inquiry into the conspiracy allegations to be conducted by a New South Wales Supreme Court judge of appeal, unprecedented. While the contents of the fourth volume of Justice Wood's report are not in the public domain, what is known about this appalling chain of events is, firstly, that the basis for Mrs Arena's allegation that David Yeldham was involved in paedophile activities at all was third&hyphen;hand and relied on the assertion of an informant whose brother had told him Yeldham was identified in a photograph.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6834">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Mrs Arena claimed parliamentary privilege in protecting her sources in declining to give evidence before the Wood royal commission, as she was perfectly entitled to do. Thirdly, Mrs Arena has failed subsequently to name any more so&hyphen;called prominent individuals and has failed so far to substantiate her allegations that there is a criminal conspiracy engaged in by the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and Justice Woods to protect those individuals from exposure. Fourthly, as Professor Enid Campbell, Professor of Law at Monash University and an expert on parliamentary privilege points out, there may be very real questions as to the validity of any external body, such as the inquiry set up by the Premier and supported by Mr Collins, to inquire into the truth of matters covered by parliamentary privilege, in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, then, this sorry episode involving parliamentary privilege has left one person dead, the integrity of the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition and the impartiality of the royal commissioner questioned, and others, including parliamentarians whose identity has been barely disguised, subject to innuendo and smear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recent controversial use of parliamentary privilege has involved Senator Conroy reading into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a transcript of interviews said to be by National Crime Authority investigators with Mr John Elliott and others&mdash;evidence that had been ruled inadmissible in the Supreme Court of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hasten to say that serious issues appear to have been raised relating to the operation of the NCA and its investigation of Mr Elliott and others. I acknowledge there is a legitimate public interest in assessing the efficacy of the NCA as a public institution. As aspects of the matter concerning whether the protection of parliamentary privilege extends to matters covered by the secrecy provisions of the NCA have been referred to the Senate Committee of Privileges, it would be inappropriate to discuss it in any further detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it fairly and squarely raises a broader issue of community concern&mdash;that is, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the extent to which information that is otherwise inadmissible in courts or tribunals, or confidential information or even commercially sensitive information or that classified as secret in the national interest, can be made public by a member of parliament simply reading the content of documents into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> with impunity. Although there are cases where the community may well feel that the justice system has failed, is it really appropriate for the matter to be tried again in the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raises the spectre of individuals being persecuted or being accused in a public forum with little or no effective redress. If the legal system has failed to achieve a fair balance between the interests of the person or persons accused of criminal or civil wrongdoing and the public interest in having that person brought to justice, it is, in my view, for the legal system to address. There is not much point in having elaborately honed rules of evidence to protect those accused if, once acquitted, the trial is run again in parliament without any safeguards at all for the individual concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recent controversial resort to parliamentary privilege was the statement in the New South Wales parliament by Richard Jones MLC that the columnist Piers Akerman, who had vehemently opposed the proposed heroin trial, is a drug addict. Although Mr Akerman has denied the allegation, had the damage already been done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate, of course, provides a right of reply to persons aggrieved by statements made under parliamentary privilege. Some other parliaments have now adopted this procedure. But it is cold comfort when all it can do is to provide some damage control. It is not a procedure which can be used speedily to counter incorrect information and in circumstances where the damage to an individual's reputation may be irreparable or damage to commercial interests incalculable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters have prompted me to revisit the purpose and objectives of parliamentary privilege. Whilst I unreservedly accept and will fearlessly defend the proposition that parliament could not function democratically 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6835"> if parliamentarians are impeded either individually or collectively in carrying out parliamentary work, it begs the question whether serious misuse of privilege could ever be regarded as assisting or protecting the proper work and functions of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article written in 1988 entitled `Parliamentary privilege: changes to the law at federal level', Mr Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate, issued a timely warning when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The retention of any immunity and powers . . . depends on the wise exercise of them and the respect commanded by the institution. If the gap between the theory of what parliament should be and the perceived reality grows too wide, there will inevitably be a demand for further changes.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the light of recent events, it is not good enough for us to go on invoking the mantle of parliamentary privilege as a cloak to relieve us of collective responsibility for our conduct. I recognise the difficulty of differentiating between fearless inquiry in pursuit of the truth on the one hand and outrageous, reckless and unsubstantiated accusations on the other. Sometimes there is a fine line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, it is time for the Senate to refer to the Committee of Privileges the task of inquiring into the misuse of parliamentary privilege and, if warranted, to recommend guidelines to enable the Senate to better  protect its processes from abuse of the immunities conferred by elected office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988 the Senate was the first Australian legislature to recognise the justice of a citizen's right of reply. Almost a decade later, it is time that the Senate again showed leadership in structuring a principled approach to deal with blatant misuse of a precious right that brings the institution of parliament into disrepute. If we do not take steps to make ourselves more accountable in the way we use privilege, we will have only ourselves to blame if a community groundswell will require it. How much longer can we continue to have all rights and no responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Susan Yeldham, the daughter&hyphen;in&hyphen;law of Mr Justice Yeldham, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How sad it is that Franca Arena can cause so much damage to so many people and then not have to substantiate or be accountable for her claims. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What a waste of taxpayers' money to have someone in her position who not only has no understanding of the basic principle of innocent until proved guilty, but does not seem to understand the difference between bisexuality and pedophilia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a sad day indeed when the only redress that the relatives of the late David Yeldham have is to write letters to the editor. It is time for us all to consider these matters and to more responsibly use privilege.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6835"><TITLE>Foreign and Trade Policy</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6835" TIME="12.58 p.m." SPEAKER="Bishop, Sen Mark" NAMEID="2L6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2L6">Senator BISHOP</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by placing on the record my support for the idea of a white paper on foreign and trade policy, as was recently released by the government, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest</EMPHASIS> . When consideration is given to the fact that it is the first such white paper in the history of this nation, one sees that it is a welcome initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A white paper in this area of government policy should, of course, have one primary focus. That focus should be on Australia's strategic engagement with the remainder of the world. Thought should be given to our engagement with our immediate region and also we should assess and evaluate our current relationship beyond this region. That engagement should seek to place Australia in a leadership position. Such a leadership position requires Australia to recognise that its own national interests are, by and large, compatible with the interests of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the Australian government must recognise that immediate domestic economic advantages do not always and only constitute the long-term interests of the region and the nation. Such an approach would identify the long-term interests of the nation and the region. In particular, policy makers should be aware of regional issues that, in advancing the region, also advance Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach requires a focus on three main areas. Firstly, there must be a recognition of the international shift towards regional forums. This trend has placed an increased emphasis on the importance of multilateral relationships for Australia as opposed to bilateral relationships. These multilateral relationships will have an impact on Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6836"> economically in areas of trade and in regard to regional security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Australia must be committed to a long-term approach to the region with a full commitment. By a full commitment, I mean that Australia must be prepared to tackle all regional issues that will advance both regional and national interests. This means being involved in the region on difficult issues, such as human rights, as opposed to only issues that create economic benefit to Australia. This would recognise that regional security is also assisted by the advocation of democratic ideals and beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, Australia must have a plan for Australian involvement in this region. Identification of growth sectors and political trends is an important tool. However, this identification is of little value without a government plan that seeks to advance regional and domestic interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In determining the course of Australia's engagement, it is incumbent upon the government to recognise that the national interest is served by the pursuit of the following goals&mdash;regional security, sustainable domestic and regional economic growth, and the exportation of democratic ideals and goals. Integration of these goals and the right balance between the three identified areas of Australian involvement is, it must be conceded, a difficult proc ess. That is why a strategic approach is required. This approach would identify areas of concern and interest to Australia and then set about creating an environment in which these goals may be attained. I would like to discuss each of those issues in some detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, multilateral relationships. This approach has two policy implications&mdash;regional security and regional trade. As previously mentioned, there has been a gradual shift over recent decades from a high emphasis on bilateral relationships to an increased emphasis on multilateral relationships. This has resulted in a redefining of international partnerships and often the establishment of regional trade zones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trend requires Australian policy makers to accept our immediate region as a community of nations, each engaging the others and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making decisions based on regional advancement and security while trying to acquire some domestic benefit. This trend towards regional relationships is highlighted by forums and agreements such as ASEAN, NAFTA and the European Union. Through these forums, nations as member states are moving forward together, rather than as separate entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An appropriate response by the Australian government would be to actively participate and engage these forums, rather than seeking to do business in a bilateral paradigm. Put simply, if East Asia decides to move forward together, Australia must seek to share in that advancement with the whole of Asia. Australia must seek to influence those decisions that primarily must occur through multilateral channels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's white paper does not appear to recognise the importance of this approach. It continues to define the national interest in terms of immediate economic achievement without any thought to long-term planning and outcomes. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Multilateral means will remain an effective way to advance Australia's interests. However Australia must concentrate on issues where its national interests are closely engaged.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The white paper also argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A central feature of the Government's approach to foreign and trade policy is the importance it places on bilateral relationships as a means of advancing Australian interests.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This comment illustrates no attempt to identify long-term trends or to even seek to influence those trends through Australian engagement in regional forums that determine those events and outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The danger of an approach that is not long term or strategic and underestimates the significance of multilateral negotiations is highlighted in recent problems between Australia and China. These problems are a result of Australia's posturing regarding its relationship with the United States and its poor understanding of the impact of a beat-up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6837"> of bilateral relationships with the United States in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China, as an emerging world economic power and an obvious regional military power, will have an intense impact on the future direction of the region. Australia must be aware of this when conducting its foreign affairs and it must also be aware of the impact from its bilateral negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is likely that the United States involvement in the region and China's response to that will have the greatest impact on issues of regional security over the next 15 years. Australia will play a crucial role in this regard. The involvement of the United States, as the only remaining world superpower, will assist in underwriting security in this region. Australia's close relationship with the United States means that we have an opportunity to benefit from this involvement. On the other hand, China's response to this involvement and to Australia's role will have an equally significant impact on the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, China's role in the region will have an impact on Australia's future success. China has a rapidly growing economy which provides a large market for Australian industry. Equally important to Australia, as a Western liberal democracy, is the process of reform, both economically and politically, that is likely to take place in China. Management of Australia's relationships with the United  States and China will be critical in Australia's position in the region and our own economic advancement. To date, the government has not managed this mixture of relationships well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has overplayed its hand by posturing in regard to the Australian&hyphen;American reliance. The annual Ausmin talks were hailed by the government as a `re&hyphen;invigoration' of the alliance. This comment, in addition to the white paper's emphasis on bilateral relationships with America, highlighted that this government has not identified the trend towards multilateral diplomacy and the impact this will have on our relationship with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the posturing of the `re&hyphen;invigoration' comment and the white paper, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peoples Daily</EMPHASIS>, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . Australia shows a strong trend of relying on the USA.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . not only exaggerates the importance of the US military presence in the Western Pacific, but also it supported enhanced defence co&hyphen;operation between the US and Japan.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Chinese commentary said this revealed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . the two basic orbits of foreign policy of Australia: in economics and trade it faces towards Asia, but in security it relies on the USA and Japan. This shows that although Australia has continuously expressed the idea of getting involved in Asia, it lacks confidence that the members of the region can solve their own security issues through dialogue and consultation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These comments were later reprinted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . If nothing else, these comments illustrate how bilateral relations with the United States are interpreted in the region and the impact this can have on Australia's further engagement with the region. The fact that the government did not understand this before its needless posturing on the US&hyphen;Australian alliance is of some concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This highlights an equally important issue. This government, through its white paper, has failed to devise any plan for Australia's engagement in the region over the next two decades. It is fair to argue that the government has  identified a number of trends that are occurring internationally and, more specifically, within our immediate region. Those trends are the continued expansion and economic growth of the East Asian region, the emerging significance both economically and militarily of China within the region, the increased significance of East Asia economically to Australia, and the impact of increased regional trade on skill acquisition and employment growth. All of these points are correct, yet the white paper details no plan to involve Australia in the progress of these likely trends in such a way as to place an Australian influence on these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no clear and defined plan by the government to assist Australian industry and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6838"> business with its engagement of the region, nor is there an attempt by the government to state and argue for an Australian position in regard to these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this respect, the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the National Interest</EMPHASIS> is an excellent chronicle of events to date and a sound analysis of the likely trends that will proceed over the next 15 years. It however makes no attempt to place Australia in a central position to take advantage of these changes. This lack of strategic plan for Australian engagement within its immediate region is a major failure of this white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the white paper appears to hedge its bets in regard to engagement of the region. For Australia to be accepted by its neighbours as a truly active member of the region, it must make a complete commitment to the future of this region. This requires Australia to not only make decisions and plans about issues of economic benefit but also to realise that the safety of regional citizens and the maintenance of their basic human rights is in Australia's interests. Internal political unrest which stems from a lack of reform creates a broader sense of turmoil within the region. This does not serve the interests of Australia or the region itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History has taught us that economic reforms have generally been preceded by political reforms. As countries open themselves up to the West, they are likely to feel enormous  pressure on their societies which did not exist before. Management of these reforms in a peaceful and constructive way will allow the region to remain secure and to advance over time. While decisions on human rights do not provide immediate economic benefit, the rights of all people and the advantages that stem from political reform are, in the long term, an advantage for the region. The government's white paper has not recognised this. It maintains that issues which relate to employment growth are of primary concern, and that issues which do not relate to this outcome are of a secondary nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attitude, however, signals to our neighbouring countries that we have an interest in the region only for economic advantage rather than a wholehearted commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment to the region on all issues. Generally, this white paper lacks clear objectives and a method of achievement. It is a document that does little to define Australia's place in the region or the world. Equally, it fails to correctly interpret the impact of current international trends both for our region and for Australia. Without an appreciation of those trends, and their impact on our country, our own national interests will not be adequately served. In this sense, the white paper is a missed opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6838"><TITLE>Racism</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition certainly should be concerned about this magazine.

As the Deputy Prime Minister himself pointed out last month, One Nation has repaid this loyalty from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock Stock &amp; Barrel</EMPHASIS> by privately meeting with Ron Owen from the Shooters Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some more interesting bits in the magazine, that he failed to quote&mdash;I thought you would be interested to hear some of those as well. This magazine has a very interesting advertisement which features a picture of a cupboard. The advertisement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New gun laws have made your possessions a target. Flushed doors, internal hinges, deadlocks, 6mm of

<PARA STYLE="Para">And so you can buy one of those cupboards which will be available to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an article about snipers and how to pick up targets. It is a very interesting article, particularly the way in which it talks about how you need to pick your target very carefully and makes very clear who the target should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ought to be of concern to all people in Australia and certainly to the government. The government would do well to make a declaration fairly soon about where its preferences are going and if, in fact, it is going to support the entry of people like this into our parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition should take note of the cartoon&mdash;even though not a very good one&mdash;of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. Tim Fischer, himself, has referred to it. As they are lined up in front of a firing squad, the Prime Minister is saying:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another target for this magazine is the whole vaccination program, which is the subject of a bill to be debated very shortly in this parliament, and on which the Democrats have certainly supported the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was delighted to see reports in today's press about the former Governor&hyphen;General Sir Zelman Cowen declaring his support for a republic. As the debate over Australia's head of state intensifies, those present in the chamber will be aware of the significance of a former Governor&hyphen;General, a former member of the Privy Council and a former defender of the monarchy now backing the republican cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Zelman Cowen is one of Australia's foremost constitutional lawyers and was the Dean of Faculty of Law, University of Melbourne, before becoming Governor&hyphen;General.  His conversion to the republican cause is a very significant step towards the goal of having an Australian institution for our national head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tide is certainly turning on the republican issue. I believe a country's head of state should symbolise the ethos, values and aspirations of a nation. It is for this reason that I personally support an Australian republic. I do not believe the British monarchy represents the values which characterise Australia. It follows, therefore, that I do not consider the monarchy to be an appropriate institutional 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> format for the office of Australia's head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are public opinion polls now on the subject of a republic? More than 40 years ago in 1953, 77 per cent of Australians supported the monarchy and only 15 per cent supported a republic. However, by December 1996 the AGB McNair poll, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, showed that a majority of Australians in all states except Tasmania supported conversion to a republic. This has been confirmed by the September 1997 Newspoll, conducted for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which showed that 54 per cent of Australians favoured a republic while only 30 per cent supported the monarchy, with 16 per cent being undecided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a little about the history of republicanism in Australia which first appeared in the 1850s, when the Australian colonies were attempting to gain self&hyphen;government from Britain. The republicans of the 1850s identified republicanism as a means of gaining political autonomy. Essentially, this derived from the axiom of 19th century nationalism, that all nations should be self&hyphen;governing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When self&hyphen;government was granted to the Australian eastern colonies in the 1850s, republicanism&mdash;in terms of local independence&mdash;lost momentum and its sense of urgency. It was not until the 1880s that republicanism again became a strong sentiment in the Australian community. The republicans of the 1890s were driven less by a desire to be independent of the British government than by a desire to create a society which symbolised the spirit of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ideal of Australia becoming a republic was pursued by many of those who participated in the federation debates during the 1890s. Among those were many of the writers for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, including Henry Lawson and his mother, Louisa, who was the editor of a republican newsletter in Sydney in the 1880s and 1890s. However, conversion to independent republican status was not regarded as a feasible option by the harder heads in the Australian colonies, because towards the end of the last century the economic structure of the colonies was geared to providing food and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6842"> raw materials to the British market and our security depended on the presence of the Royal Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, economic and security considerations constrained the further development of republican sentiment in Australia for most of this century. However, the constitutional crisis of 1975 did result in some rekindling of support for the concept of an Australian republic, particularly in the left wing of Australian politics, and this probably explains why there has been something of an ALP flavour to the current resurgence of republican sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, in the 1990s, John Howard, as Prime Minister, while making no secret of his commitment to the constitutional monarchy, has recognised that there is strong sentiment in favour of a republic and that the matter is an issue for national discussion. He has provided a national forum for debate on the question of our head of state by establishing the Constitutional Convention to work through the issue. Personally, I am pleased that the Constitutional Convention is to go ahead, because I believe that, in focusing national attention on the issue, the debate will be considerably advanced and will strengthen support for Australia's conversion to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has already broken a lot of the ties which once bound this country very closely to the United Kingdom. I would like to detail some of what I regard as the incremental steps towards a republic. Firstly, Australia's national anthem was changed from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> on 21 May 1977. We no longer have  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> played in cinemas before the movie begins, as was the case until well into the 1960s and 1970s. I must say, it would now seem very strange to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Australia has its own flag and has not used the Union Jack as our official flag for many years. No government since 1945 has appointed a member of the royal family to hold the office of Governor&hyphen;General. When Buckingham Palace sent out feelers to the Australian government for the appointment of Prince Charles as Governor&hyphen;General in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> early 1980s, it is said that it was found that there was very little political support for the idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1942, Australia adopted the Statute of Westminster. This statute was passed in the United Kingdom parliament in 1931 and stated that the British parliament would not legislate for any dominion without the request and consent of the dominion concerned. It is interesting that Canada and South Africa both accepted this independence from the British government much earlier and more readily than did Australia. It was probably only the imperatives of the Pacific War which caused Australia to adopt the Statute of Westminster because Australia needed to be in control of its resources for the war effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in 1986, Australian legal appeals to the Privy Council in London were abolished, so that the High Court of Australia became the final arbiter of the Australian legal system. Thus, slowly, step by step over the past half&hyphen;century, Australia has moved progressively away from, and become independent of, the United Kingdom government. Commenting on the slow ending of our dependence on the United Kingdom, John Hirst, a well&hyphen;known historian at La Trobe University and a leading conservative republican, has said, `All this has gone on and no alternative focus of civic loyalty and allegiance has replaced it.' His view is that, having moved away from Britain and the monarchy, Australians of today no longer readily accept the appropriateness of the Queen as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For that reason, John Hirst suggests that there is a void in our national consciousness about our head of state and, in effect, he believes we are in a kind of transitional zone. I must say that it seems to me self&hyphen;evident that the Queen is no longer quite acceptable as our head of state. For example, nobody really wants her to open the Sydney Olympic Games, but we have not decided who or what the replacement should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the circumstances that we find ourselves in in the 1990s, Australia is very different from the sort of place it was in earlier times in our history when republican sentiment existed. Today, the key constraints of security and trade which made it impractical for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6843"> Australia to adopt a republican constitution in the past, no longer apply. To me, the question of the republic is a question of national maturity and national identity. One could ask: is it a matter of an idea which has reached its time? Personally, I would have to say, that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contemporary Australia has carved out its own role in the world. Just as in the mid&hyphen;1980s we took charge of our legal affairs by ending Australian appeals to the Privy Council, I believe that it is now appropriate for us to take charge of our political affairs by creating an Australian institution for our national head of state and, in so doing, converting the Commonwealth of Australia to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But unfortunately, as this debate is progressing, there is growing evidence that those who support the continuation of the British monarchy in Australia are perhaps not totally committed to rational debate on the question of whether we should have an Australian head of state. Disinformation is being put about, for example, that the Australian Republican Movement wants to change the Australian flag. This is simply not true. The ARM has no policy at all on changing the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I frequently hear it said that the Australian Republican Movement does not know what it stands for. That, of course, is absolutely not true. The ARM supports, firstly, creating an Australian institution reflecting the democratic and egalitarian values of Australian society for our national head of state to replace the British monarchy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, the office of head of state should be largely ceremonial. Thirdly, the ARM would want Australia to still be called the  Commonwealth of Australia and we would still remain members of the British Commonwealth. Australia would still compete in the Commonwealth Games, and we would have still, of course, play cricket. Republican Australia would continue to recognise the Queen as the head of the British Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I think the tide of history is running in favour of an Australian republic. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the polls confirm the trend and show ever increasing support for the conversion of the Commonwealth to republican status, I do not think the time of change is very far away. Mr Acting Deputy President, I would seek leave to incorporate some tables of recent polls which show trends in support of the republic and the monarchy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in this debate to say a few words about the public sector. As a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, this particular subject has great relevance for the people I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canberra bashing is an expression, in my view, of anti&hyphen;public sector sentiment and, in the context of the Howard government's pursuit of such sentiment, a reflection of an anti&hyphen;government approach. It is not anti&hyphen;government in the  sense that certainly Mr Howard is the head of the Liberal government, but anti&hyphen;government in the true sense of the word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governance of the people of Australia is something that every federal government has been aspiring to, certainly since Federation. But I put to this place that this government is not about the good governance of Australia and, in the context of the people who provide the service to the public in the employ of the federal government, that they do not respect or acknowledge the contribution that those people make to the good governance of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who are engaged in servicing the public of Australia. There are some 1.3 million, which represents one of the lowest proportions of public servants in the Western world and the expenditure is quite small in comparison, with only the United States of America and Japan spending less on their public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the pursuit of providing a service to the public that I want to focus my remarks on today. What we have seen over the last 18 months is not a rapid increase in improving the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Australian public sector. What we have seen goes far beyond that. Indeed, because of the work of previous governments, we have a very lean and efficient public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are now seeing is a deconstruction of the ability of that sector to provide services to the public, a deconstruction that has come in many forms and that started with the changes to the Industrial Relations Act. Those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changes undermined the morale and dignity of the working people in the employ of the federal government. Anyone who has worked on wages would know that having security of employment is probably one of the most important features of our general feeling of wellbeing, of having a safe and healthy workplace and remuneration adequate enough to ensure the welfare of ourselves and our families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes, under the Workplace Relations Act, brought many pressures to bear in both the private and public sector. But the flow&hyphen;on effect from the changes that were put in place will disadvantage all Australians. That may seem like a big statement but, based on previous industrial relations awards systems, many of the gains made in the public sector by those working people impacted eventually through the private sector awards, pulling the standards of working people up right throughout the work force in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other changes affecting the morale and dignity of the public sector in this country. The changes to the Public Service Act is one quite critical initiative that is currently occurring. Those changes again diminish the job security quite specifically of people employed in the public sector, as well as undermining their conditions of employment across a number of key facets. One of those key facets is equal employment opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that public servants have the opportunity to be able to seek promotion, to provide fearless and frank advice and to have some redress if unfair decisions are made. The appeals process and the Merit Protection and Review Agency that this government is advocating abolishing go to the heart of those employment conditions that had built our public sector up into a strong and important contributor to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other changes announced recently with respect to superannuation and outsourcing plans that affect the employment of people. But I just want to say something, perhaps on behalf of the people who are employed in the service of the public in this country, to everyone who is not so employed. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6850"> Every time you hear the Prime Minister or this government criticise Canberra or the role of the public sector, what you are hearing is a government which is not advocating the good governance of this country. What you are hearing is the words of a government which prefers to see the governance of this country managed via a contract, or by a sector whose members do not, perhaps, put the interests of the public at the forefront of their considerations but put first either the interests of their shareholders or their ability to make a margin for the survival of their own company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want my comments to be misinterpreted as an attack on the private sector's role in the provision of services. The point I am making is: why introduce a layer into the provision of services in such a way that it compromises in some way, whether it is through efficiency or value for money, the effectiveness and the equity of delivery of those services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opportunities do exist across the board for a melding or a meshing of the mechanisms of service delivery to be agreed upon and formulated. That is fine, and we have seen examples of that operating effectively. What is not fine, and what will not serve the public interest, is an approach by this government to deconstruct the public sector completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government does not understand, as I think has been reflected in many of the comments by senior ministers, is that not everyone in Australian society is motivated by their salary package or by a need to climb up the socioeconomic ladder. There are some Australians who are quite prepared to serve in the interests of this country in whatever way they feel comfortable with. That means that there are people right throughout society&mdash;and I am focusing on those employed in the service of the public&mdash;that choose to do that job because they have a social conscience. They choose to work in such a way that their work will benefit others. This notion does not enter the consciousness of our Prime Minister. That observation is one that is most telling about his and his government's attitude towards both those employed in that sector and those Australians who stand to benefit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the equitable distribution of and access to the services provided in that context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where is the recognition and acclamation that many people in the service of the public deserve? The silence is deafening. What instead we get from the so&hyphen;called leaders of our country is massive cuts, forcing redundancies which the figures of the union which represents those workers show are now up around the 18,000 mark. That is 18,000 individuals. Add on to that their families that have been specifically disaffected by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen no less than four or five significant attacks on their conditions of employment. We have seen no less than three quite specific initiatives to deconstruct the public sector and the networks established to provide services to the public, be they physical or be they information services or indeed be they the regional centres employing public sector people. There is no acclamation from this government; there is only a barrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We feel it here in Canberra because a high percentage of our work force is employed in the public sector. It is a lot lower than it used to be but it is still in the high forties&mdash;48 per cent, I believe. So we are feeling it and probably the regional areas of this country are also feeling it. I have no doubt that metropolitan areas are feeling the results of the funding cuts and coordinated approaches provided previously, whether it is the closing down of the Medicare office or whether it is the changes to the employment programs that now preclude effective access and operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no acclamation for these people; there are only demoralising changes and funding cuts that appear to have to have no motivation beyond the driest of dry fiscal justifications. There must be a point when the current leadership of this government understands that to go any further and continue on this path will structurally undermine Australia's ability to service those in need. It is not good enough to set up a structure where those who can pay can still get access or where those who happen to live near an outlet providing services can walk to them.

How will Centrelink work and how will it improve service delivery to Australians around the country from a wide range of backgrounds?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Troeth is prepared to ask the important questions that need to be addressed in the Senate and I am very glad to have the opportunity to answer this very sensible question. Centrelink, which was launched, as Senator Troeth said, by the Prime Minister today, is a service delivery agency of great importance for the delivering of government assistance and programs. It has been a major innovation in government service delivery. It is an historic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably, as the Prime Minister said today, in the context of the last 50 years there has not been a more important reform in terms of delivery of services to Australians. It puts government services under the one roof. It provides a one&hyphen;stop shop for information about government assistance and for programs for Australians from all around the country and from a wide range of backgrounds. It is going to be the human face of government with a focus on customer service, no more queues or standing behind counters, better forms and more user&hyphen;friendly correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know how government departments seem to have had a knack of writing to constituents letters which are beyond understanding and certainly quite frightening. We are trying to change all that. We believe that the services under Centrelink will be more convenient for customers and more efficient in the use of taxpayers' funds in delivering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services. It will operate through 400 centres around Australia employing some 24,000 staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have almost eight million customers, when you take into account the elderly on age pensions, families, the disabled and people who need unemployment assistance, and make 159 million payments every year. So we are going to be covering the services that have been provided in the past by Social Security, by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, by the Department of Health and Family Services and by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. We are going to be providing all the services that Social Security used to provide: child&hyphen;care and student assistance payments, registration of applicants for income support and for employment assistance, self&hyphen;help job search facilities, referrals for employment assistance and specialist labour market assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, it is all about better and more efficient service. We have heard for so long now the frustration that Australians&mdash;particularly, but not only, people in country areas&mdash;have found in trying to do business with different government offices, where they have had to go to the CES and fill in one long form and stand in one lot of queues to register that they are unemployed and then go to the social security department, fill in another form, stand in more queues, and get more anguished and frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very important thing today to have the Prime Minister launch this new enterprise of the Commonwealth government. He said in his speech today that the first constituent concerns he heard as a new member of parliament, and they have continued on ever since, related to the frustration that his constituents found in trying to access and deal with different government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think many of the people watching question time today would express that same concern. We have done something about it. There are different services under the one roof for the very first time. The chief executive officer of the agency is a woman, Sue Vardon, who was the Telstra Businesswoman of the Year in 1995. She is responsible for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6853"> 24,000 staff and payments of about $40 billion every year.

To apply the change depending on whether a person considered they had retired or were unemployed would be inequitable and would create an obvious avenue for avoidance.

The Cassini space probe is due to be launched on 14 October, or no later than 15 November this year, carrying some 33 kilograms or 33,000 grams of plutonium. Given the government's expressed concern when the Russian space probe Mars 96 re&hyphen;entered the earth's atmosphere last year with its deadly cargo of 24 grams of radioactive plutonium, will the government make representations to the United States government about the threat of nuclear material being deposited over Australia and the world by the Cassini space probe?

Can the minister provide details of independent auditing at Roxby Downs, particularly how the contract was arranged and the terms of reference? Can he also table copies of any audit documents that have been produced? Can he indicate to what extent Commonwealth environment agencies have reviewed that audit or the criteria from the audit?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be pleased to do so. It is true that last Friday the Howard government launched the national vegetation initiative, which we have called bushcare. It was a historic occasion because it was the launch of a program that gives the best chance to revegetate Australia that we have ever seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will know, Madam President, that for 200 years we have been clearing this country. In fact, there has not been one year in which we have revegetated more than we have cleared, and we as a government are determined to turn that around. To do so, we have put in place a $350 million investment in retaining and protecting remnant bush and in revegetating. To launch that at the national landcare conference last Friday was, in fact, a great privilege.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will mean a tenfold increase in investment in revegetation programs in this country. In fact, some seven-odd very small dispersed programs that the previous government ran will now not only be combined but have that enormous increase in capital support. Not surprisingly, this is being welcomed by all Australians interested in the challenge of revegetating our country, and the response from community groups has really been enormous. I must say that that is particularly pleasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity also on Friday to announce a contract of $4.5 million with Greening Australia, which has established itself as perhaps the paramount of non-government organisations with expertise in this particular field. This contract will allow it to support community groups with that expertise all the way across Australia in order, therefore, that the community contributions will be made on the basis of best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community applications for support under the bushcare program are in and have been vetted through the regional assessment processes and the state assessment processes. I have had the opportunity, as a member of the ministerial board, to peruse them in relation so far to Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. Announcements to those community groups will be made in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program supports the range of environmental programs that the Howard government has been able to commence, particularly in the area of nature conservation. I am very pleased to be part of a government that is taking nature conservation so seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be aware that the task force that we set up on whaling to look at ways in which Australia might lead the world towards an end to commercial whaling has now put down its report, and that is being considered by the government. We will respond to that in the near future. I am very much looking forward to the government taking up that challenge, and it will be applauded by all Australians.</PARA>

We have only to look at the recent comments of the tax commissioner, Mr Carmody, about the way in which trusts are used to minimise tax and at some of his proposals to crack down on the use of trusts to minimise tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question posed by Senator George Campbell to Senator Kemp went to the issue of the government's recently announced savings rebate of $450. We can all recall, I am sure, that the Prime Minister ruled out receiving the $450 rebate because of his personal financial position. But it is interesting that a significant number of other members of the government&mdash;in particular, ministers, who I will refer to shortly&mdash;will receive at least part or all of the $450 rebate because of the income they receive from trusts.</PARA>

The Treasurer recently announced&mdash;and I have a copy of his 10 February 1997 statement&mdash;that the government would proceed with trust loss measures but would significantly modify the provisions proposed in order to make the operation of the measures fairer. In this context I would suggest that the use of the description `fairer' means `weaker'. Why is the government backing down on trusts and making the proposed provisions weaker?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach in this is the fair go approach, which means that Australia deserves, in the public interest, for this area to be reviewed. Our concern is that the government, quite properly, through the Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), announced a thorough review of tax evasion, tax avoidance and excess tax minimisation. Our concern is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has stepped into the middle of it and said, `Hang on! Don't worry about it. It's not going to go too far.'

I think they are right to raise this in the public consciousness and to pursue it; and, incidentally, I think they are right to support the Treasurer and the tax commissioner, which is what they are doing, in asking for a thorough review which will result in reform so as to trap those who evade, avoid and minimise unduly.</PARA></SPEECH>

Obviously, under any arrangement, whether it be a partnership or a company, such vehicles can be used for tax minimisation purposes, for tax avoidance purposes and for tax evasion purposes et cetera. So I think it is unfortunate that we are using the label `trusts' to put people into a little box as essentially being tax avoiders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such an environment, I think it is necessary to explain the plight of a lot of small business people, particularly farmers, who, for a number of reasons, either inherit a trust through property that they might have acquired through a trust arrangement, or who operate a trust through it being a convenient method by which to hold assets, to operate a business, to ensure there is a degree of equity 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6871"> between members of families and so on. But I must remind the Senate that, in a wider use of trusts, trusts used as collective investments attract billions of dollars around the world, even in Australia. As such, trusts are a very convenient and efficient method of holding investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to cover a lot of issues in a very short time so I will dwell on just a few. The name of the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, has been mentioned. I think it is unfortunate when this happens in these sorts of debates. We should all know that Mr Carmody, as the tax commissioner, has two roles. One is to ensure the collection of tax according to law and the pursuit of schemes that could lead to evasion, minimisation et cetera. On the other hand, given his capacity, he also has a commitment to advise the government in relation to future policy changes on tax. Unfortunately, during this debate I think those roles have been confused by some commentators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which I wish to mention is that there have been some comments about the way other countries deal with trusts. I remind the Senate that some countries certainly do treat tax trusts as companies but, in a sense, where they adopt such a procedure, there are other mechanisms available. For example, to take one, the United States allows US shareholders of some companies to be taxed instead of the company. In other words, there is a flow&hyphen;through treatment to ensure greater fairness and greater equality depending on the type of vehicle that you are using in relation to the operation of your business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other issue I wish to remind the opposition about is a very significant press release adopted by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) earlier this year when he referred to an exposure draft in relation to trust loss measures. Now, nothing has really changed in relation to that process. The only thing that has changed is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has indicated that he does not want to impose upon small business such impositions as would make them unviable or lead them into bankruptcy. We have often seen, particularly when the opposition was in government, the so-called unintended conse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quences. All the Prime Minister has said is that he does not want any unintended consequences flowing from the measures that have been announced and which will proceed to adversely affect or bankrupt small business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This document comprises several sections, including letters and petitions of various wording, signed by 63,559 Australians and all in support of increased funding for the ABC. The document was handed to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, by a delegation led by the ABC personalities Roy Slaven and H.G. Nelson on 27 March this year. At that time, the Prime Minister assured that delegation that the document would be tabled in the Australian parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 June this year, I put a question on notice asking when the Prime Minister intended to table the document, and I received the reply that it would `be tabled in the next session of parliament'. On 2 September, I received a letter from the minister for communications advising me that the Prime Minister had passed the document to him as it was not in the required format for tabling in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realised the distress that this must have caused the Prime Minister not to have been able to carry out his promise to all those supporters of the ABC, including such distinguished broadcasters as Mr Slaven and Mr Nelson, and his distaste at being in a position of not being able to do what he had promised to do in answer to my question on notice. Actually, three quarters of these petitions do seem to be in conformity, but that must have escaped the Prime Minister's notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore proposed to Senator Alston that either he or I seek leave to table this document in the Senate in order to keep faith with these more than 63,000 ABC supporters. Senator Alston readily agreed, and it gives me great pleasure to table this most significant document.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR act) and other legislation. The amendments are aimed at clarifying existing provisions and ensuring that they operate in the manner originally intended by the legislation. The bill also corrects some minor drafting anomalies and oversights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These minor changes will give appropriate effect to the major reforms which have been achieved through the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act is delivering genuine flexibility and choice at the workplace level. Over 1600 new agreements have been certified, including 47 agreements made directly between employers and employees, and over 500 AWAs have been approved. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6877">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act is better balanced than its predecessors, and reinforces a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. Section 127 of the act is providing an effective remedy to prevent and stop illegitimate industrial action, with over 100 applications for section 127 orders being dealt with by the Commission to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial progress has been made towards harmonisation of federal and state systems through complementary legislation and a cooperative approach to administrative arrangements and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope for our reforms to continue to bring about the productivity improvements which are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth will be further enhanced by the technical amendments proposed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Awards and arbitration&mdash;Part VI of the WR act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill clarifies the limitation on the Commission's capacity to exercise its arbitral powers during a bargaining period for a proposed certified agreement. The legislation limits the Commission's power to arbitrate during a bargaining period in relation to matters at issue between bargaining parties. The fundamental objective is for the parties to reach agreement without arbitration. The Commission should not arbitrate, for example, in relation to a claim for a new allowance to be paid if that is at issue during bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a possible unintended consequence of limiting access to arbitration is that it may prevent the Commission from varying an award to include a "safety net wage adjustment" to give effect to National Wage Case safety net decisions where bargaining periods have been initiated and wages are an issue between the parties. The bill therefore amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to make clear that the limitation on arbitration during a bargaining period does not prevent the Commission from exercising its arbitral powers to deal with an application to vary an award to include a safety net wage adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also clarifies the status of awards made under section 170MX of the act, making clear that they are enforceable in the same manner as other awards. It also makes clear that where awards are simplified by the Commission during the award simplification process, any provision which has been included in a simplified award because it is incidental and necessary for the effective operation of the award does not cease to have effect at the end of the simplification interim period.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill addresses two issues which have emerged during the operation of the certified agreement provisions of the act. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the bill clarifies the time limit allowed for applications to be lodged for the certification of an agreement. Secondly, it makes clear that the 14 day period provided to employees to consider a certified agreement does not have to start again if an employer takes on new staff during the approval period. Any new starters will, of course, have to have the effect of agreement explained to them and be provided with a copy of the agreement, but the amendment will avoid the delays and unnecessary expense which would result if the approval period were to start again from scratch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Employment Advocate</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">and Australian Workplace Agreements&mdash;Parts IVA &amp; VID of the WR act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included in the bill are some procedural amendments aimed at facilitating the smooth operation of the Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA) provisions. These changes include an extension to the time limit for lodging AWAs and empowering the Employment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical requirements relating to the filing of AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time limit for lodging AWAs with the Employment Advocate is to be extended from 14 to 21 days, recognising that a 14 day limit might be difficult to meet, especially where the parties are in rural centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision will also be made for the Employment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical filing requirements for AWAs and ancillary documents. The Advocate will have to be satisfied that the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has had to return a number of AWAs lodged to date because the applications failed in some minor way to meet the filing requirements. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AWA. There will still need to be strict compliance with the substantive requirements such as the provisions relating to the no&hyphen;disadvantage test and genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be waived. This will avoid the waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AWA parties are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also corrects some anomalies in the provision dealing with the right of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, authorised officers who are investigating possible freedom of association breaches can only enter premises where they believe relevant documents may be located. By contrast, authorised officers investigating AWA breaches and Department of Industrial Relations inspectors investigating breaches of awards or certified agreements may 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6878"> enter premises where relevant work is being performed and interview employees, without being limited to premises where documents may be held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill corrects this anomaly by providing for authorised officers to enter places of business for the purpose of interviewing persons in connection with possible breaches of the freedom of association provisions of the act. As is the case with the existing rights of entry, the new provision does not allow access to premises used for residential purposes, and the right to interview does not empower an authorised officer to compel a person to answer questions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the process by which designated awards can be determined by the Commission and the Employment Advocate for the purpose of applying the no&hyphen;disadvantage test to agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act presently provides that where there is no award covering the work of employees whose is to be covered by a certified agreement or AWA, the Commission or the Advocate, as the case requires, is to `designate' an appropriate federal award for the purpose of applying the no&hyphen;disadvantage test to the agreement. The bill will allow the Commission or the Advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no&hyphen;disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by the employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Termination of Employment&mdash;Part VIA of the WR act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill clarifies the application of state laws in relation to termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award or agreement. It also ensures that there is consistency in the time limits for making applications in respect of termination of employment, and makes it clear that each of the various types of application relating to termination of employment may be discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made for the maximum amount of compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal or unlawful termination of employment to be calculated by reference to the amount of remuneration to which the applicant was entitled for the previous 6 months. At present the act provides for the compensation limit to be calculated by reference to the amount received by the employee during the preceding 6 months with the employer. The proposed amendment will benefit employees by ensuring that the compensation limit is calculated by reference to the amount which an employee was entitled to receive, if that amount would be higher than the amount actually received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Freedom of Association&mdash;Part XA of the WR act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill ensures that an agreement may not be certified when it includes a provision inconsistent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the freedom of association provisions of the WR act. This provision is required primarily because some unions are seeking to include preference clauses in agreements. The freedom of association provisions of the act prohibit discrimination based on membership or non&hyphen;membership of a union, and render preference clauses void and of no effect. However, some unions still cling to the past and want such clauses included in certified agreements. Leaving aside the futility of such an exercise, there is a real risk that some employers and employees may mistakenly take these void clauses at face value, disadvantaging employees and breaching the act in the process. It is therefore essential that agreements containing preference clauses are not certified, and for the same reasons, provisions in existing awards and agreements which breach the freedom of association provisions should be removed. Provision is therefore also made for awards and agreements to be varied, on application, to remove void preference clauses.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As presently drafted, the definitions provision relating to withdrawal from an amalgamated organisation refers to only one of the two methods by which organisations could amalgamate under the act, and as a consequence, it has unintentionally excluded some organisations and branches from access to disamalgamation. The bill corrects this defect to ensure that the disamalgamation scheme will be able to operate as it was intended.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said in my speech on the second reading, we are concerned that the bill excludes parliamentary review and disallowance in certain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6882"> areas. A short history is that the 1994 bill provided for parliamentary review and disallowance and excluded judicial review. The 1996 bill, this bill, removes the ability of parliamentary review decisions and makes those decisions subject to judicial review under the ADJR. We are concerned that parliament is being excluded in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the 1994 bill recommended that parliamentary review should be maintained. It is worth noting that Senator O'Chee, in his capacity as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, also held that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned about is that parliament should have a continuing role in terms of defining the character of the instruments we are talking about here. The role of parliament is important there. Secondly, we are concerned that if the only avenue of review of a decision by the Attorney were to be a court or an ADJR process then that would be costly and inaccessible to most ordinary Australians. As a consequence, we need to have another look at parliamentary review as an opposition. We think parliamentary review provides another avenue for consideration of such decisions in a way which individual Australians or groups of Australians do not have to be forced to fork out high court fees and high legal fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney has argued that the parliamentary review may be inappropriate as he claims the issue is ultimately one for judicial determination. As I said earlier, most of the issues debated in this parliament, if not all of them, can ultimately be ones for judicial determination. We do not think the Attorney's argument is a strong one in respect of that. We say that there should be some capacity for judicial review, as is provided by the act. But our amendment goes to ensuring that there is also capacity for parliamentary review in the houses of parliament of decisions made by the Attorney.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment I support. I foreshadowed my support this morning when I spoke at the second reading stage. I pointed out then that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was somewhat concerned&mdash;`somewhat' is probably a very impartial sort of word&mdash;quite concerned about this particular measure. I note that Senator O'Chee, in that fine speech that he delivered in New Zealand, was also rather concerned about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I read out a speech prepared by the Deputy Chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, Senator Colston. That speech set out quite clearly the concerns that he and the committee had about this matter. He has an amendment which has been circularised and it is in precisely the same terms as that which has been circularised by the opposition and by the Greens (WA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, this bill does provide for the Attorney-General to issue conclusive certificates as to whether a certain instrument is or is not legislative. That puts the whole thing back into the hands of the executive. As I said this morning, that is not on. The way to overcome that is to make such certificates 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6883"> disallowable. That, to some extent, fixes the problem, except that you will have to&mdash;I have no doubt the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will&mdash;keep a wary eye out for those particular certificates. I assume that those certificates themselves will need to be tabled in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those certificates, according to the bill, will be unreviewable by courts except in respect of procedural legalities. I will quote from a document which has come from Senator Colston. He himself, of course, would have been able to and would have liked to progress this matter, but due to illness he is unable to be here. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a serious diminution of the rights of parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That provides, of course, a mechanism of checking or scrutinising the Attorney-General's certification.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6884">

It will do this by an Attorney-General's certificate. When we suggest that this certificate itself should be disallowable, what happens? The parliamentary secretary indicates that, as that certificate is a legal document, a legal opinion, it ought to be tested by legal process, not by parliamentary process. Hence, you are taking it right out of the hands of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely Senator Ellison, in his heart of hearts, does not believe that. He has served on a number of committees of this Senate with great distinction, might I say.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in the previous administration. When the previous government was in office, it introduced its bill in 1994.

The concern I mentioned in the second reading debate was that it was good until you looked at who was allowed to be consulted over what, and then we found it was very narrow and going in a one-way direction away from the rest of the community. I would like to say that, whilst our amendments are nice, the Democrats' amendments Nos 4, 8 and 9 are nicer because they have elements that our amendment does not have.

I note that this change does not necessarily exclude environmental matters, because the ambit of the current government proposal can be read to include them.

<PARA STYLE="Para">What we are seeking to do here is pick up some exemptions from consultations which we think should be made and some tightening of exemptions as well. There are a number of changes between the 1994 bill and the 1996 bill on the range of matters for which exemptions from consultations may be granted. For instance, this bill does not provide for exemptions: where a legislative instrument, for instance is urgently required; where significant or comparable public consultation on the instrument has already occurred; where notice of such an instrument would give an unfair advantage to particular individuals; or where the Attorney certifies that the public consultation would not be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of these provisions, we have specific provisions providing exemption where: the instrument is required in the interests of national security&mdash;in which case no certification by the Attorney is required&mdash;the instrument is an airworthiness directive, the instrument is a commencement proclamation, the decision maker proposes to make a 12&hyphen;month temporary legislative instrument or the regulatory review body certifies that the LIP is adequate and otherwise waives part 3 consultation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the bill, in a sense, is too restrictive in some cases and can be open to abuse in some others. What we are moving by way of these amendments are proposals which, firstly, allow for an exemption where the instrument is urgently required or where notice would give an unfair advantage to individuals. However, we think that should be balanced out by only allowing a 12-month operation in these circumstances and also ensuring that the instrument be certified by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the regulatory review body as being necessary. Secondly, exemptions for prior, significant or comparable public consultation should be retained, but there should be a requirement that the regulatory review body certify that such consultation has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we think the public interest test should be retained, thus eliminating the need for specific national security and airworthiness exemptions. In our amendments, we have included both these matters in a list of matters included within, but not limiting, the public interest test. So we think there should be the capacity for a somewhat broader public interest test. We are concerned that, given the broad effect of this bill on legislative instruments, we do not want to prejudice matters for which the public interest would sometimes militate against consultation pursuant to the bill. As opposed to the government's proposal, in all these cases we would require the Attorney-General to certify to that fact. As I said, in respect of some cases covered by this test the government has specifically mentioned in this bill, the Attorney-General is not always required to so certify. We think he or she should be so required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the exemption in respect of commencement proclamations, and we also think the exemption for 12-month temporary legislative instruments should otherwise be removed. There should not be a need, beyond those I have outlined already, for temporary legislative instruments to be created. A provision of this nature, we think, could lead to widespread abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the power of the regulatory review body to limit the consultation required should be retained, we think, as outlined in the bill. They are the aspects of our amendments and I commend them to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This particular provision was of grave concern to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and really I guess I am standing here with the knowledge that that body, which we entrust to examine these matters, is most concerned about this particular provision. In fact, what happens is that the bill actually excludes instruments which provide for national schemes of legislation such as Corporations Law, the competition code, road transport reform and occupational health and safety legislation, and all of those under this bill are to be excluded from parliamentary scrutiny in the form of Commonwealth parliamentary disallowance, not necessarily state or territory&mdash;I will come to that in a minute. In fact, these national schemes are likely to become more important and more frequent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is inappropriate that parliament should not be able to scrutinise what really is legislation. Parliament should have the same option of disallowance of instruments as it has over other legislative instruments, many of which, of course, are of far less consequence than national schemes. Really, it is incongruous that the national parliament should not have control over national schemes, or any control over national schemes, if you like, in respect of that. The amendments which I am moving provide for national legislative scheme instruments to be disallowed by either house of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to indicate to the committee that we are dealing with national scheme regulations made by the national executive government. I would like to point out to the committee that, without the amendments that I am moving, there would be no capacity for the Commonwealth parliament to disallow a regulation, but that that power would still lie with the state and territory legislatures. Now isn't that ironic? I ask the committee whether we should be denying ourselves that right, in fact escaping our responsibilities in the mat

The position is that the system of intergovernmental agreements and national schemes is increasingly a way of approaching the solution to a lot of problems that Australia faces as a nation, and these national schemes prove very useful. Where you have a disallowance in one parliament in relation to that it could well unravel the agreement reached between the various state governments, territory governments and the Commonwealth, or it could unravel a particular scheme. I understand that there is a working party made up from representatives of the various scrutiny of bills committees from around the country. That working party or committee is headed by Senator O'Chee who is working through this very problem of how you deal with this question in a federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As Senator Harradine says, it is desirable for the Commonwealth to have some power in these schemes but, of course, constitutionally the Commonwealth can only have power in areas where the states have power, if the states cede that power to the Common

We can understand the concerns that have been raised and that are raised from time to time in this place about specific schemes and specific arrangements that are made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murray for understanding the difficulty of my position. Without expressing a view on the particular amendment, it may help the committee if I briefly outline the history of Senate scrutiny of national scheme delegated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the previous government introduced regulations for national scheme legislation in relation to road transport which were subject to disallowance in this place. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6893"> committee took a strong view that the national scheme regulations were defective because they contained vicarious liability provisions. In particular, the vicarious liability provisions affected the driver of a combination vehicle&mdash;such as a road train&mdash;whether or not he knew of a defect of any portion of the combination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The committee took the view that that was unsatisfactory. After negotiation with the relevant minister in the previous government, the previous government agreed that the regulations would be withdrawn and that no new regulations would be made unless they were satisfactory to the committees in all of the jurisdictions. It is a matter of record that we have not had national regulations in relation to road transport yet because of that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Murray asks: where am I as a representative of this parliament in terms of negotiation with the relevant state committees? The situation is that it was the subject of a discussion in October last year in Perth at a meeting of the representatives of scrutiny of legislation committees throughout Australia. The meeting comprised representatives of both the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee&mdash;the very fine committee of which you are a member, Senator Murray. So we, as a jurisdiction, had two representatives at that, and there were representatives from each of the state jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time it was agreed that there should be a uniform approach to scrutiny of national scheme delegated legislation. For the benefit of honourable senators, those proposals were contained in the discussion paper released in October 1996. It talked about the criteria which should apply to the scrutiny of national scheme delegated legislation. It was very much a lowest common denominator mechanism. We found something that all the jurisdictions agreed upon&mdash;that is what I mean by `lowest common denominator'. It is more jus gentium rather than the poorest possible law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then I have had discussions with the committees. Many of the committees have expressed a desire that it should be dealt with in the federal parliament rather than being subject to disallowance in each of the state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jurisdictions. However, there are caveats to that because a number of jurisdictions have not finally signed off on it because they are still considering it. In the case of South Australia and in the case of the Northern Territory, it has not been possible to get a position from the committee because of either a recent election or the forthcoming election in South Australia. But work is proceeding on it apace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The concern that both Senator Cooney and I had in Perth was that, unless there was a clear mechanism for the disallowance of national scheme regulations in some form or another, the grave danger was that some of the state scrutiny committees might be tempted to indulge in the drafting process and be participants in the drafting process. Both Senator Cooney, who is a very erudite man on these matters, and I, in my own humble way, decided that that would not be satisfactory because we believed that scrutiny not only should occur but should be seen to occur, so that the public has confidence that these matters are being overseen by their representatives and their rights are being protected.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad Senator Margetts has referred to what the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances said. That report was given to this chamber by Senator O'Chee, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I was very grateful to have Senator O'Chee inform the committee of the discussions that had taken place with other scrutiny bodies from other parliaments. I was also grateful for the indications he gave of the transport regulations and the vicarious liabilities that were associated with those regulations, which alerted the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to the possibilities of individual rights being trampled upon. As I indicated this morning, it is a function of this parliament to uphold the rights of individual citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted what the Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) has said on this matter. The minister indicated that there needs to be in many cases the ceding of the power of the states to the Commonwealth in respect of the subject matter of a number of these national schemes. That is to say that, in a number of the national schemes, the primary responsibility lies with the states and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as the minister said, it is necessary for that power to be ceded to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said it was necessary to cede power to the Commonwealth, but he really meant that it was necessary to cede power to the Commonwealth government because, unless we have some say over the regulations, it is in effect ceding the power to the Commonwealth government without any opportunity for this national parliament to protect the rights of individuals and to exercise its function of audit and control over executive government&mdash;which this parliament has a long history of doing. I am surprised that Senator Bolkus and the opposition would support this legislation which denies us that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated previously, that power is still with the state and territory legislatures. What you are doing under this legislation is to remove that power from us, the Commonwealth parliament, but it is still with the state and territory legislatures. What is the sense in that? Please, somebody tell me. Can Senator Bolkus tell me, on behalf of the opposition, what is the sense of withdrawing that power and right and responsibility from the Commonwealth parliament and still allowing the power to remain in the state and territory parliaments? It is in respect of national schemes we are talking about. If they are national schemes, let us treat them as national schemes, but we should have some responsibilities in respect of those particular schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely disappointed about this because I have seen some of these state and Commonwealth committees working. Might I say, since the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is here, that I also have seen how SCAGS works. Frankly, in many of those areas I am not impressed, particularly in the area of, say, censorship officers. It is often the Commonwealth bureaucrats who appear to give the advice and there is no argument about it. In fact, so much so that one wonders whether what we are doing here is to allow the sort of sloppy advice that came from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department&mdash;whether it came from the OFLC originally, I do not know. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give you one example and that was the government decision to establish an NVE category in film and video classifications. The Attorney&hyphen;General of this Commonwealth issued a press statement on 8 April 1997 which was demonstrably false. How can the Attorney&hyphen;General of this country issue such a statement that was demonstrably false? I have said that before and nobody has denied that it was demonstrably false, and seriously so. It misled the people of Australia and would have misled this parliament had it not been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it was of such a nature that the Attorney&hyphen;General should have considered resigning. I believe it is far worse to do something like that than to inadvertently, possibly, make claims in respect of travelling allowance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I say this to the minister and to the government: I am not prepared, to be quite frank, to take anything coming from the Attorney&hyphen;General's office without thoroughly inspecting it and assessing whether it is truthful or not, in respect of major issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get back to the amendment, here we have a proposition that is coming from the government which will deny us, the Commonwealth parliament, a power which is retained by the state and territory legislatures. What is the sense in that? What really will occur is that the unelected public servants and bureaucrats, or particular ministers, will have the final say, without any effective examination by elected members of parliament in respect of legislative instruments which have hitherto been the subject of disallowance or putative disallowance in this chamber.</PARA>

What you have under that is either the National Native Title Tribunal or the ability for the states to set up their own native title tribunals, so that both could operate in tandem with each other. But it does not require a national scheme, as I understand it, or an intergovernmental agreement. It is much like having uniform consumer laws or uniform food regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the native title legislation, that is a situation where the amending bill would provide for states to take it or leave it&mdash;that is, if they want to have their own native title tribunal they can; if they do not they go with the Commonwealth.

I understand the government's desire&mdash;and the previous government's desire&mdash;to have the sunset provision. There is a need to clean up dead legislation, and dead and anachronistic instruments, and that is a noble thing to try to do. But the concern is that, by bringing in such a broad&hyphen;ranging sunset provision, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6904"> exempting only the small range which appear in schedule 1, all forms of instruments which may have some very valid social and continuing impact will not be protected. If they are not protected, there is no way to ensure that they are reactivated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament cannot initiate regulations, although we can, of course, amend legislation. But once instruments relating to a broad range of social policies such as consumer protection, quarantine, the environment, employment, education and so on lapse because of the sunset provisions, there is very limited scope to ensure that the protections, proposals, provisions and programs put in place under them can continue in those circumstances where there is a need for a continuing role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all realise that much of the legislation, instruments and regulations of social impact that we are talking about here have a very long continuing role. For instance, if we were to look at legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act, that has had a quite fundamental and lasting effect on much of the state based legislation, and it does in fact govern much of the political debate at the moment. That is a piece of legislation, but there are all sorts of legislative instruments and regulations which also have such an important effect, and that effect does not necessarily die after five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand why the government wants to embrace a sunset provision, and it is something that was discussed by previous governments as well. But, with more reflection, I think there has to be more concern about the impact of such a sunset clause. One alternative is to say to the government, `Set the departments loose on stocktakes and report annually to us as to how they're conducting their stocktakes,' and there are other alternatives that we could look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that, subject to other senators wishing to speak at this point, we postpone consideration of part 6 of the legislation at this stage and revisit it when we come back to the bill sometime tomorrow in order that people may have a bit more time to consider not just the impact of part 6 but also any alternatives that we may want to move to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to speak briefly on this first report of the Medical Training Review Panel. This panel was established as a result of Democrat instigation last year as part of the negotiations on the medical practitioner provider number legislation. At that time, although we agreed with the rationale of that legislation and the basic principles, we had specific concerns about the shortage of reliable data on medical training positions, about the availability of part&hyphen;time training places, and about career paths and opportunities open to hospital medical officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say here that there have been several years of questioning at estimates and I still have not been able to actually discover a lot of this information. The Medical Training Review Panel was set up to address these issues and I believe this report&mdash;the first&mdash;demonstrates the value of that panel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before talking about the report, I want to say once again, despite the exaggerated and downright false claims being made in some quarters, every junior doctor in this country has a guarantee of either a training place or a medical job. They will only end up driving taxis, as some of them are still claiming, if they cannot get a training place, if they will not move to take up a training place, or if they turn down a job in a hospital. They may want to make that decision; that is over to them. But the fact remains that they do have a guarantee of medical training or employment, and that is a lot more than many other young Australian graduates have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the situation is not perfect and I believe the panel will play a crucial role in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6910"> identifying where the problems lie and make recommendations to address them. For example, I have been particularly concerned about the situation of doctors working in our public hospitals and am pleased to see that the panel has made several recommendations about improving training opportunities and career paths in public hospitals. One clear consequence of the provider number legislation is that more medical graduates will be spending more time in public hospitals and I happen to think that that is a good outcome. What we now have to do, of course, is to make sure that we improve the training, the conditions and the career paths of those non&hyphen;specialist medical practitioners who are undertaking hospital work. The panel's recommendations in this area are sound and I believe that the minister should implement the panel's national training model. I will certainly be asking him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very pleased to see the panel's proposal to engage a consultant to look at the selection process for medical trainees. One of the biggest concerns voiced to me by medical practitioners and students right across the board is that the selection processes&mdash;the review processes&mdash;are not transparent, are often biased, particularly against women, and, indeed, are open to abuse. It is well past the time that all medical colleges were dragged into the 20th century and I hope the panel's work will contribute to ensuring that that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The panel's data collection efforts to date go some way towards putting to rest the claim that some 400 graduates will miss out on training places as a consequence of the provider number legislation. The panel has identified 1,369 first&hyphen;year advanced training places that are going to be available in 1998, but has yet been unable to identify additional training opportunities within the public hospitals. As about 1,200 graduates are going to be coming out this year, ready to start next year in training places, I think we are well equipped to offer sufficient opportunities. As the numbers coming out of medical colleges are expected to stabilise at around 1,000, in the years ahead it is looking positive and promising for all of those who want training places.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The panel will be letting a consultancy to gather information in the expectation of being in a position to report as required by the end of the year on whether the places available will be sufficient to meet the demand. That final batch of information will give us a very clear picture on the effect of the provider number legislation. Last year the Democrats successfully convinced government to put a safety net under its provider number proposals to ensure that every medical graduate had either a training place or a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that process relies upon the monitoring and data collection work of this panel. It has clearly been successful and I congratulate Dr John Loy and Mr Robert Wells of the Department of Health and Family Services for their work in setting it up and in chairing the panel. I also congratulate all members of the panel on a job well done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising briefly to speak to the first report of the Medical Training Review Panel, I have not had a great deal of opportunity to inspect the minute detail, but this is of major concern to people following the changes that have taken place in the medical training of doctors, once they have finished their graduation. Of course, tied in with this is the need to ensure that a number of doctors do get themselves out of the city and into the country areas because there is still a shortage of doctors in country areas. But I think that if every position that is available can be filled, and if every doctor can be given post&hyphen;graduate training, that is very good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest one of the tables here and that is the female advanced trainees percentages by specialty. Obviously, in some areas and in some specialties there is quite a way to go before these specialty areas in some states get access to some of these colleges for anywhere near the number of females who are graduating. It is an issue of concern that these colleges are not easily accessible to females. We now know that there is a significant number of women who are graduating from university with medical degrees, but the same number is not being reflected in the numbers in the specialty areas. I think sometimes there can be glass ceilings with respect to that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6911">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hours that they are expected to work can be fairly horrific. The conditions under which they might well be expected to work are not family&hyphen;friendly, and that is certainly of some concern. I notice in something like occupational medicine in New South Wales, in 1997, that only 12.5 per cent of the advanced trainees are female, 62.5 per cent are in Victoria and there are none in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. I think there is still more work that needs to be done in some of these specialty areas to create accessibility for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have concerns about the preparedness of some of the specialist colleges to increase the number of people entering those specialty areas. We know that in some areas there is certainly a shortage and they are in short supply. That is something that the colleges themselves will have to address. It is almost like a closed shop. If it was a union situation, you would certainly see the government protesting most loudly about closed shop union tactics. However, in this particular area, that does not seem to be happening with the same enthusiasm and vigour we have seen elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training and access to medical services is certainly something that is of major concern to people in country areas because there are shortages of doctors. In fact, in areas that are not remotely distant from some of the major rural centres themselves there can be shortages. That is something that certainly has to be addressed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review panel and the consultancy that is being undertaken is certainly a step in the right direction to get some figures and some clear definitions and clear ideas of where things are moving to. It is, as I say, an area of significant importance, because the health of this country is something that is of concern to everybody.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to clear up something that Senator West said. As a member of a specialist college and having been involved in this process for many years, I think it is fair to say that medicine has a very proud tradition in that female entry into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medical courses is over 100 years old now. One of the most important things is that it was equal wages for females right from the very beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid that Senator West is showing her age. I am not being unkind, nor would I ever be to somebody I have a very high regard for, but the reality is that Senator West was reflecting the views of her own training era. Times have changed since that era. I merely want to draw Senator West's attention to a recent study that was done questioning female medical graduates as to the reason why they did not take up various specialties. Many people who do specialise in medicine do not wish to go into particular specialties. I give you the example of neurosurgery, which is very demanding. The necessity to reoperate is frequent. The hours are terrible because they are often associated with motor vehicle accidents. This example is apposite, I suppose, in light of Wayne Goss's present position. The facts of the matter are that it is very demanding and stressful surgery for the surgeons involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This study has shown that many women do not wish to involve themselves in the processes of training for these particular specialties. It is not that there is any limitation, as Senator West is saying. There is a requirement for a standard to be maintained. There is very close selection for training processes. There are continual reviews. The Australasian College of Surgeons has just published a report. Manpower surveys have been done right from the very beginning to ensure that adequate numbers of specialists are available. But the facts of the matter are that many people do not wish to undergo the training for these particular specialties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases there is a shortage of specialties because, on the one hand, doctors, either male or female, do not wish to enter those specialties. Alternatively, many females do not wish to undergo the rigorous training because of the requirements of those specialties. Senator West suspected that there was a glass ceiling. I can assure her it no longer exists, if it ever did exist, in relation to females. I will attempt to get that report 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6912"> which updates the report that has come out and which has been tabled today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the colleges of physicians, surgeons, anaesthetist, et cetera have been adjusting to the demands of family and the biological imperatives of being female and have made part-time training available to cope with the problem of the numbers that are available in these specialties to satisfy the demands of the Australian population. I will attempt to get hold of a copy of that report which updates the report that has just been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The colleges are to be commended for not only making training positions available on a part-time basis but also recognising the fact that over half the medical students now in our medical schools are female. Because we have an ageing population, there will be increasing demands on medical services. So there is a problem that needs to be addressed not by dint of being female but by dint of the ageing population and the inadequate total numbers that are going to be available for the treatment of patients in this country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to speak briefly in relation to the Airservices Australia corporate plan. There are a number of aspects that I want to touch on tonight. Firstly, let me say that, in relation to the financial and other planning assumptions, there is a lot of good work being done by Airservices Australia. I had the opportunity to observe at close hand the work to implement the new TAAATS system which involves intense training for the new airport traffic staff. It is a whole new system and new technology, with implementation to commence in early 1998. I see from this report that, in this financial year, the plans are on track and under budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that Airservices is transferring all its search and rescue activities to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. In principle, that is a good thing. However, I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the jury is still out in relation to how the Maritime Safety Authority is going to handle that responsibility. We have had a number of matters of concern raised in estimates about the operation of the Maritime Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I wanted to touch on tonight was the reference to the implementation of Airspace 2000 proposals, which have recently been delayed by the decision of the CASA board to undertake an investigation of the actual safety aspects of that plan in relation to the four airports that are to be affected principally by the downgrading of airspace to category E, as I understand it. That downgrading will, in the opinion of many commercial pilots who have the responsibility of flying planes with many passengers into those airports, pose grave safety dangers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns I have is that when it was proposed to implement this new airspace proposal the corporate plan suggested that it be implemented in December 1997. I must say that I cannot think of a worse time to implement a new safety regime for any airport in Australia. That is the period in which we come to the peak of air traffic. In this case, we had a situation where a number of pilots were suggesting that they would refuse to fly commercial planes into the airports affected. In the case of my state of Tasmania that was both Hobart and Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the plan gone ahead in accordance with this time line, we could have been faced with a situation where flights were not coming into the state at the peak holiday time. That would have had a disastrous effect on the state. In relation to that, Airservices should have had more regard to the timing of any radical change to the airspace management system that applied to any airport in Australia. In this case, airports of Tasmania, the Northern Territory&mdash;that is, Alice Springs&mdash;and Port Hedland in Western Australia were affected in the same way by this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to refer to a matter which I think has been dealt with at other times&mdash;that is, the allocation of specific pricing for rescue and firefighting services in various locations around the country. I see I am not going to

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is never a large document but it is of some interest and not a little concern. I have read briefly the Nuclear Safety Bureau report of 1 January to 31 March 1997. It indicates there were 12 abnormal occurrences reported to the Nuclear Safety Bureau for that period. One of those occurrences was assigned level 1&mdash;that is, an anomaly beyond the authorised operating regime. They do not say what it is. There is usually very little detail in these reports. That is why they are so small. The remainder were assigned level zero&mdash;that is, of no safety significance. What it might mean is that they come under what is considered to be an acceptable limit. It does not mean to say that there might not be a release of radioactive material but somehow or other they scrape in underneath what is considered to be an acceptable level for workers' health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also says on page 3 that an audit of radiation protection at HIFAR was performed during the previous quarters by officers. We never actually see these audits, unfortunately. They do conduct these audits but we do not necessarily see them to see what is involved. They say in this one that four items of non-compliance with audit criteria were noted; otherwise the audit found radiation protection to be satisfactory. That is really interesting. Once again, they note four items of non-compliance. They have asked for an action plan, but we do not find out what those items of non&hyphen;compliance are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They report discharges from HIFAR of argon 41, a radioactive gas produced by neutron activation of air during reactor operations, which continued to regularly exceed the current weekly working level previously set by ANSTO. Nevertheless, they say that doses to the public resulting from these dis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charges are well below radiation constraints. But I do not know whether that means they are well below those dose constraints for people working in and around where that argon was discharged. What does it mean `well below'? We are getting more and more information about the impacts of low levels or long&hyphen;lived low levels of radiation, which are giving us more information. Some of those are coming out from epidemiological studies from the United States. They provide quite new information to that which has already been available through the study of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems of studying the survivors is that you are already looking at people who may not be genetically disposed to the effects of radiation in the same way as those people who actually died. The effects of long&hyphen;lived low level radiation may well be and is considered to be affected by the fact that many people died initially and that other people are more likely to have not suffered the effects of just simply low level radiation doses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been modifications. Apparently it was found there was an inconsistency in the level of non&hyphen;destructive examination specified for welded joints of the pipe work which had been undertaken. There was final documentation for modification still outstanding. They are talking about the decommissioning of the MOATA reactor. This is the first nuclear reactor in Australia to enter the decommissioning phase. I think probably as a parliament we need more information about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the restrictions on the operations of the nuclear plant. On two occasions during the quarter, as a result of the granting by the Nuclear Safety Bureau of a temporary exemption from an operational limit and condition, the Nuclear Safety Bureau required ANSTO to provide notification of the measured core excess radioactivity of HIFAR approximately 24 hours after start up. Advice was received to the Commonwealth that the maintenance of satisfactory standards for safety of the operation of HIFAR beyond 2003 would require a significant safety upgrading to be carried out and that the NSB 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6914"> would carry out the safety assessment of any upgrading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some major questions on this issue. I noticed Senator Denman was in the chamber and was seeking the call on this issue and may well be able to add to this. It is an issue that should not be swept under the carpet. I really find it distressing that we are left with six pages to deal with such an important issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

From what we heard about the last report, I hope in the end there will not be any more nuclear reactors. I hope that eventually this reactor will be phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time there were seven abnormal occurrences reported to the Nuclear Safety Bureau from 1 April to June 1997. Under the HIFAR operations as well, it indicates that:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I mentioned about the last report, the last quarter before that, that there were reported discharges from HIFAR of argon 41. This report says they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continued to regularly exceed the current weekly working level . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know what it indicates for the workers. I do not know whether they are trying to spread it out more like the spread effect with a shotgun by using a more regular rotation of workers or what they are actually doing. It does not actually say what they are doing in relation to the argon 41 discharges, where they are going and what effect they are having. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the quarter, ANSTO informed the NSB that it agrees that the bureau has a role in the review of the store for new (unirradiated) HIFAR fuel. ANSTO is preparing a Safety Analysis Report for the new fuel store which will be provided to the NSB.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope so, but I also hope there will be wider consultation. They say that the safety report is to examine potential hazards of plutonium oxide powder. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANSTO has also initiated action to design and manufacture double&hyphen;walled steel canisters . . . in line with current international best practice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope it is at least that. There are indications that they are looking at HIFAR modifications. With regard to the replacement and inspection of the reactor secondary cooling system piping, which was carried out during the 1995 HIFAR major shutdown, they are looking at conducting an examination of above&hyphen;ground welds which have not been examined. The bureau is considering the proposed strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submission for a temporary modification to a circuit breaker drive motor to overcome repeated failure of a motor was received during the quarter and reviewed by the Nuclear Safety Bureau. So there is already a situation where there are repeated failures within the existing plant, and the last report indicated that the safety really is not up to scratch for what is considered to be best practice. They are actually having to move already to improve that. There is a lot more to say. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in this adjournment debate I want to showcase some very positive developments for the Tamworth Country Music Festival and for regional northern New South Wales. Tamworth is country music in this country. There is an immediate link and theme when most people in Australia put these two things together: the city of Tamworth and country music.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, Tamworth and country music are also being linked internationally with places like Nashville in the United States. This growing status here at home and overseas is helping to provide a critical mass for the region in developing a tourism industry. Indeed, New South Wales tourism says that the Tamworth event and the Bathurst 1000 car race are the two largest tourism events in New South Wales outside of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The festival is crucial to the economic development of the Tamworth region. It offers the critical mass to create high quality and well&hyphen;trained jobs in the tourism and hospitality industries. It is a unique event which attracts tourists to a region that has no special geographic or physical attraction like the coast. The region, indeed, is suffering depopulation, and tourism has been identified as the strongest economic option to grow employment opportunities in this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Tamworth council is concerned that the Country Music Association of Australia might take the festival to another location. It is now critical that a more appropriate performance venue is developed in Tamworth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian and international artists are putting up with very primitive and dusty conditions in a covered horse sale ring at the Tamworth showgrounds. There are portable dressing sheds for artists. There are poor visuals and acoustics for national and international radio and TV audiences. Despite this, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Tamworth Country Music Festival attracts an enormous crowd. Over 300,000 people come to the Tamworth region over the 10 days of the festival. That is 30,000 extra visitors in town each day of the festival. The total of 300,000 visitors across the 10 days is equivalent to the number of visitors that are estimated to be at the Sydney Olympics for one day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the scale of this and its importance to the region, I welcome the initiative to construct a new facility in this city, the Tamworth Region Entertainment Centre, which will become the permanent home of the festival held in January each year. What is proposed is a 5,000-seat multipurpose centre. It will be the focal point of the country music awards presentation. It will also incorporate a museum and hall of memory to Australian country music icons such as Tex Morton and Slim Dusty. The entertainment centre will have many uses for this region apart from the January festival. There will be trade shows, concerts, agricultural field days and vehicle promotions, to name just a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional community is right behind this project. It is not just a matter of government money for this $5&half; million project. The Tamworth council has provided the land on a prime site very close to the city, and it will commit further funds to guarantee that this project is finalised. New South Wales tourism has put in $1&frac14; million and, to show the commitment of the local community, $800,000 has been pledged by local businesses. The council currently has a plan to raise another $500,000 from the local community. The Country Music Association of Australia is also providing $75,000 to this event over the next four years. To complete the funding, federal money is required in addition to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I led a delegation together with the Mayor of Tamworth, Councillor James Treloar, in conjunction with the member for New England, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. The case is being put to the government that, under the national tourism development program, we should be putting federal funding into this very worthwhile project for northern New South Wales. This will not only develop tourism in this region but help boost the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6916"> economic growth of a region that is depopulating, as I indicated earlier.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to the Hon. Lance Barnard, who passed away. Due to the fact that I was away from parliament, I was not able to do this at the appropriate time. Many great tributes have been paid to Lance. I do not want to repeat what has been said with regard to a lot of things that he achieved and has done over a long period of time. I would like to speak more about the time that I knew Lance, when he worked from my office for some two years. He provided a great service to the community. In fact, he did so voluntarily. It would be very rare that days would go by when somebody from within the community was not coming in to see Lance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, Lance won the seat of Bass in 1954, winning the seat that his father had held from 1934 to 1949. He then contested nine elections&mdash;all of which he won on primary vote. He never had to go to preferences, which was something he was always proud of. Of course, we know that he became Deputy Prime Minister on 5 December 1972. He held that position until 12 June 1974. On the same day, he also become the minister for 14 separate departments&mdash;something that I do not think has ever been equalled or is ever likely to be equalled again&mdash;when he and the then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam held all the ministries. One thing Lance had often said to me, with regard to the very great friendship that he had with Gough, was that Gough was never really keen to see the Deputy Prime Minister become Acting Prime Minister, although Lance did do that on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over many years, Lance worked for so many organisations. I would like to put on the record some of the board memberships that he had in Tasmania. He was a board member for the Ainslie House Association, an elderly home service provider, and for Eskleigh, another elderly and disabled peoples home. He was a board member of the Railway Silver Band, the Masonic Society, and the Police and Citizens Youth Club. In so far as the Police and Citizens Youth Club is concerned, they recently completed new basketball court facilities. That was, in many ways, due to the efforts of Lance. The funding for that and the assistance that they received was due to a lot of his effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also a member of the Northern Tasmanian Regional Development Board. He was a board member of the Launceston City Council's Australia Day Committee, the Keep Our Post Office Committee, the Northern Group Training and Group Training Australia. Lance first became involved in Group Training back in 1987 when Northern Group Training was established in Launceston. He was elected their inaugural Chairman, holding that position until he retired in 1996. He remained a board member until the time he died. Indeed, he was made a life member of Group Training. In fact, he was the first life member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a board member of the Launceston Returned Services League and was involved in the Royal United Services Institute, the Artillery Association, the Artillery Historical Association, Northern Tasmania, and the Australian Cat Federation. As cat lovers and cat show entrants around Australia we often used to have some discussions with him. He was known, I think, to the Assistant Clerk with regard to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of Lance's involvement in various community efforts goes on. That involvement was recognised in part when the Launceston community and Launceston City Council held a community reception for him on 31 July. Bob Campbell, the city manager, whom I know quite well, often said that Lance was one of the best door openers and purse string looseners around&mdash;and he was. It really must not go unnoticed that the effort he put in for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6917"> the community was tremendous, particularly as somebody who was not being paid for it and somebody who was going on for 78 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance was involved in getting the funding for the Inveresk Railway Yards redevelopment, the Earl Arts Centre&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Lance Barnard was very significantly involved in achieving the funding for the AMC hydrodynamic facility in Launceston. Your government actually took away that $14&half; million; we lost that. I hope that some day the government will see fit to reinstate that funding, because it is a very important facility, not only for Launceston. You now have the member for Bass in Warwick Smith, and I wish Warwick would actually stand up for Bass as much as Lance Barnard did. Of course, if he did, we probably would not have lost that funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former defence minister, Lance Barnard was the Director of the Office of Australian War Graves. Many people probably would not know that it was really through his efforts and the effort of Mr Everard Baillieu CBE that the El Alamein memorial of participation was erected and dedicated to the soldiers that fought there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did many things to assist the RSL in Launceston&mdash;right up until the time he left to go to Melbourne. He was helping the RSL look for new premises, and they are now hoping to moving into that new building. Lance Barnard did all those things over a long period of time as a politician in retirement. As I said, Lance was really the member for Bass for 22 years in an official way, and he was probably the member for a further 22 years in an unofficial capacity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 17th of January 1990 Benjamin came into our lives. He was our second child and was received with much joy. I should add that it was a relief to see that Ben was `normal'. I had been diagnosed in 1988 with a virus which can affect the foetus if contracted for the first time while pregnant, that is what was said at the time. I did all the correct things and did not try to conceive until I had the all clear. When Ben was a few weeks old I received the news that Ben had in fact been born with the virus. I began the cycle of seeing the virologist and paediatrician and again was told that I had a completely normal, healthy child. I must say that I could not agree as I was living with the Baby From Hell. He constantly cried, rarely slept and was never happy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weeks went by of living with the Baby From Hell with no-one in the medical profession believing me that something was wrong with him . . . I made an appointment with the paediatrician. She examined Ben and told us that he had increased tone and he would probably just be a bit clumsy . . . I should add at this stage that if Ben was a little bit clumsy I would be delighted. Ben had spastic quadriplegia, he cannot do anything without assistance. He cannot sit by himself, he has no speech, he is in nappies, he has to be fed. In other words, Ben has to have everything done for him. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6918">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so began the nightmare of trying to find out what help was available. This should be an easy process but it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our whole lives had to change because of Ben. I soon realised that the idea of ever returning to the paid work force was a far off dream and we had to face reality that our house was not suitable for a child like Ben. So in between all the running around of treatment for Ben we had to look for a new house, and not just any house, but one that would meet his requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The contributions of carers like Ben's mother have become very necessary to the success of a great deal of government programs, particularly those that have been established to assist older Australians and children and adults with disability. There is an increasing general acceptance in Australia that the state has a role to play in assisting carers and the recipients of their care, but there is far less agreement on what level and form that support should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many still see the family as the primary carer, with the role of the state being to supplement and complement family support rather than to replace it. A minority view is that, in the long term, there will be so few family carers that the state will have no option but to assume that role. The government decision in 1995 to pay a parenting allowance to those parents remaining at home to care for their children has very significant implications for carers because, along with the carer pension, it gives a level of legitimacy and recognition to the value of unpaid care performed at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental role of carers is to assist their child to live independently in the community with minimal recourse to government funded programs. However, tonight I want to point out that carers of severely disabled younger people are very, very vulnerable, given the intensity of the care which is often required and the extended periods over which it is provided. For many, that is a lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming feeling among carers is that supporting a child or a young adult with a disability is very hard work but with a little help they could actually do it. Unfortunately, that help is becoming harder and harder to obtain. The words of Ben's mother summarise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the feelings of many other carers, too. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life with Ben . . . is like living with a time bomb. We wake up each day not knowing what to expect, and can't think too far into the future. Little did I realise that my life would change so dramatically. As Michael says, Ben can only see the world through us showing him, and we want to give him the best opportunities we can. Ben will never walk or talk; Ben can never say, "Thanks mum and dad, you do a great job and I love you for it". Ben can't tell us how he feels, he can't tell us if he is in pain. Ben can never put his arms around my neck and give me a hug and say, "Thanks mum".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Policies to assist carers can only be considered in conjunction with the broader social and political context in which they are developed. The costs associated with institutional care and its unsuitability for residents and their families have driven the closure of such places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people would agree that people should be entitled to live as independently as possible within the community, but it is very well known that there are huge unmet needs out there for supported accommodation, particularly for those who are profoundly disabled. For many of those who are in such accommodation, there is often no such thing as `the community'. More commonly, there is increased isolation and increased vulnerability. So it should come as no surprise to us that many families are looking for other models of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents of children and young adults with disabilities do not doubt that institutions are unsatisfactory. Institutions such as Kew Cottages in Melbourne are not only unsatisfactory; the state government has so restricted staffing and access to day programs and other services&mdash;such as recreation&mdash;that residents find themselves locked up for many hours at a time each day. This is not so much a problem of the institutions as a problem of commitment and adequate resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So-called community integration began as an understandable and very necessary reaction to institutionalisation, but we are now seeing this policy hardened into what has become a very discriminating orthodoxy, whereby every person with a disability has been deemed to be better off out there in the community. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6919"> Government policies of community care and family based care have been driven primarily by the financial expense of institutions, with very little consideration given to the concerns of the people directly affected by those policies. Whilst nobody is arguing for the return of institutions, many parents want to move away from a blanket approach of community care, to more enlightened policies which recognise the wide spectrum of disabilities and the vastly different care requirements along that spectrum. They want to see options made available which can involve families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, undoubtedly, there are very many excellent services run by excellent people who bring dignity, achievement and self-esteem to many disabled people. However, I think these services have been set up primarily for people with mild or at the most moderate disability, and very little for people who need and will continue to need specialised services, specialised accommodation and 24-hour care. Those are very commonly in our too-hard basket. As one mother pointed out recently at a public meeting in Melbourne:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My greatest concern is for all those old parents with their ageing disabled person still at home and for all those younger parents with their disabled child now at home for indefinite years to come.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another carer supported this notion by pointing out that policies have failed to understand that `not all disabled students, especially those with intellectual disabilities, will complete their education and become adults at the chronological age of 18'. Thus they require extended care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community and family based care may at first appear to be cost-effective. It does reduce the number of people requiring residential care, but we also need to understand that it may prove very much more costly in the long term by increasing that burden on carers to the extent that many are unable or unwilling to continue their caring role, thus placing those in their care at risk of institutionalisation. Carers point out that the options for disabled people are very, very limited. Another carer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we fail to understand why it is that everyone can choose to live in an accommodation complex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of units, small houses or whatever, but not so our children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later in life, we can mostly expect to live in a charming retirement village with our peers, if that is our need or our wish, but not so our children. By denying children and young adults with disabilities a choice which we take for granted because it is not policy or because of long&hyphen;held ideologies is, I think, discriminatory and demands action as an infringement of the equal rights of such people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6919"><TITLE>Australian Youth Forum</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">J.J. travelled overseas last year and came back with a vision that related quite specifically to activating Australia's youth to be more concerned and able to take their concerns to the leaders of this country. The result of this initiative was the forum. I am not the first person in this chamber to speak about the forum and the work that was done there by over 300 young Australians from around the country. They ranged in age from 11 to 21. They covered a broad range of issues&mdash;everything from the pressing youth suicide issue to unemployment and the housing crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evening I would like to read a number of messages from this particular youth forum. The young people came up with so many ideas and canvassed so many issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and perhaps most importantly tonight, I want to place on the record my regard for my friend and colleague David Jull for the work that he has done for Australia and for this parliament since March last year.

It is a shame that, in this business, the work of people with so much to offer and with such ability ends, temporarily, I might suggest, in the way that has happened today. I am sure that David Jull is a person who will bounce back and we will see a hell of a lot more of him, because he has a particularly significant contribution yet to make to Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.54 p.m." PAGE="6921"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.54 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<ANSWER PAGE="6924" SPEAKER="Ellison, Sen Chris" NAMEID="9X5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator Ellison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. At the Premier's Conference on 21 March 1997, the Prime Minister announced that the services of the Privacy Commissioner would be available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes of conduct and to meet privacy standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assisting the private sector on matters concerning the handling of personal information is a statutory function of the Privacy Commissioner. Under section 27(n) of the Privacy Act 1988 the Privacy Commissioner is to encourage corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information that are consistent with the Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data issued in 1980 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD Privacy Guidelines).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am advised that the Privacy Commissioner receives numerous requests from the private sector for advice and assistance. In 1995/96, for instance, more than 800 telephone requests were received from private sector organisations other than credit providers. The Commissioner's office has frequently also given written advice on the application of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6925"> privacy principles and a range of materials has been developed. There have been at least 18 occasions on which the Commissioner has become involved in substantive work on codes of practice that were being either reviewed or created by an individual company or an industry body. In most cases, these codes have covered broad ethical and service delivery issues and, while making a reference to privacy, they did not aim to address all aspects of the OECD Privacy Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that since taking up duties in February 1997, the current Privacy Commissioner has met with companies and industry representatives on approximately 15 occasions to discuss the development of appropriate practices and policies within the private sector. Since the Government's offer in March that the Privacy Commissioner would be available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes of conduct, discussions with the private sector have been focused on seeking cooperation in the development of a consistent national framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 August 1997 the Privacy Commissioner released a consultation paper, Information Privacy in Australia: A National Scheme for Fair Information Practices in the Private Sector, which presents a proposal for a self-regulatory information privacy scheme and invites public debate on the issues raised and feedback by 15 September 1997. In October 1997 the Privacy Commissioner proposes to hold a series of forums around Australia for the full range of stakeholders to discuss the issues and to gauge the level of interest in, and commitment to the proposed national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Discussions between the Commonwealth and the various States and Territories about extending privacy protection to the private sector are ongoing. The aim of these discussions is to reach an agreed national approach. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to outline the respective positions of the States and Territories at this time</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The compliance costs of a privacy regime for the private sector would depend on the particular elements of the regime put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, there would be costs associated with:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> assessing existing record-keeping practices and procedures against the particular information privacy standards required by the regime;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> making any necessary changes to those practices and procedures to ensure that they complied with the requisite standards;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> maintaining systems to comply with the standards; and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government's decision not to legislate on private sector privacy followed extensive consultation based on the discussion paper, Privacy Protection in the Private Sector, released in September last year by the Attorney-General's Department. That discussion paper outlined a possible approach to privacy protection in the private sector. Its purpose was to enable business and the community generally to provide concrete comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department received more than 100 submissions in response to its discussion paper, many of which provided detailed comments. As well as formal submissions, a number of organisations took the opportunity to meet with the Attorney-General's advisers and relevant officers of the Attorney-General's Department to discuss areas of specific concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was particular concern expressed in submissions about how a legislative regime would impact upon small and medium enterprises. Some submissions argued strongly that there was no clear need for legislation in order to ensure privacy protection and that privacy concerns could be adequately addressed by business on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Small Business Summit in June last year recognised the cost and frustration from unnecessary or overly complex regulation which falls on small business. A specially commissioned survey, `Working Overtime' has found that, on average, small businesses spend 4 hours a week on `compliance matters'. Over the course of a year this costs the average small business $7000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges that complying with current regulatory requirements already imposes a significant burden on Australian businesses and is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on all business. In opting for an approach to encourage the adoption of voluntary codes of conduct to enhance privacy protection in the private sector, the Government aimed to identify the right balance between ensuring adequate privacy protection and advancing the competitive interests of Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Government is aware that many benefits, including those of improved record management and consumer satisfaction can flow from the application of information privacy principles. These benefits, and the savings that can flow from them, can also be achieved through a voluntary approach to privacy protection in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Government has decided to support a voluntary approach to ensuring privacy protection in the private sector involving the development of voluntary codes of practice. The Privacy Commissioner has already commenced consultations with the private sector preparatory to assisting the private sector implement information privacy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6926"> standards. Therefore, the Government does not agree that there will be no privacy regime applying to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were concerns expressed in some of the submissions made in response to the Attorney-General's September 1996 discussion paper concerning the potential impact on Australia of the European Union Directive on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data (the EU Directive). This issue has also received attention in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has followed closely the development of the EU Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has considered this question of the possible impact of the Directive on Australian trade opportunities with EU countries and will continue to monitor this issue closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) See answer to Question (5). The decision not to implement a legislative privacy regime for the private sector was based on an analysis of the submissions received in response to the Attorney-General's Department's discussion paper, Privacy Protection in the Private Sector. and other consultations within Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) If any of the States and Territories were to introduce privacy legislation affecting the private sector within their own jurisdictions there would be a need to assess the potential impact on projected compliance costs to Australian business, particularly those businesses with interstate operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6928">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under current Victorian traffic law, postal delivery staff who deliver mail by bicycle are required to wear approved bicycle safety helmets&mdash;this requirement now applies to all bicycle riders in Victoria. Prior to 30 May 1997, an exemption was provided under Road Safety (Traffic) Regulations 1988 in the case of postal delivery staff during the course of a postal round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the December 1996 meeting of the Australia Post National Occupational Health, Safety and Environment Committee (APNOHSEC), management, in consultation with delivery staff and the CEPU, undertook a detailed assessment of the level of OHS risks associated with the mail delivery task. As a result, Australia Post has since required all bicycle delivery staff in the States to wear approved bicycle safety helmets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia Post's decision to require bicycle delivery staff to wear approved bicycle safety helmets was made in consultation with the CEPU at the national level. As mentioned above, the risk assessment process undertaken involved delivery staff representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Victoria, the decision was discussed at the Australia Post's State OHS `Committee (SOHSC) and Delivery Business Unit OHS Committee (DOHSC), as well as at the Victorian Delivery Joint Consultative Council in March 1997. All those fora are consultative and have representation from the CEPU. In the case of SOHSC and DOHSC, staff health and safety representatives, elected in accordance with the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, are included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In Australia Post's Victorian administration, the maintenance of bicycles is undertaken either by a staff member at the workplace with specific skills in this area or through an arrangement with a local bicycle repair specialist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training is provided on an ongoing basis on both the use and loading of a mail delivery bicycle. This training is provided by a team of specialist delivery staff, nominated by the CEPU and staff from the Delivery Business Unit.</PARA>
