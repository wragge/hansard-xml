<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R285">Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997</XREF>  is not contentious in principle, and it is one that the opposition supports. The general thrust of the legislation is to protect the Australian tax base by tightening up the rules governing certain types of foreign source income earned by Australian residents. Of course, it also gives me an opportunity to recount to the Australian people some of the hypocrisy of the coalition on the issue of international tax avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to a few points of background. The current regime for taxing foreign source income was introduced by Labor to ensure that Australians were properly taxed on income earned outside Australia. Prior to these major structural reforms, the payment of tax on overseas investments made by Australian residents was, in practice, largely optional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1975, the Asprey committee recommended the introduction of a comprehensive system of foreign tax credits, under which the foreign source income of Australian residents would be subject to Australian tax and a credit given for the foreign tax actually paid on that income. This was one of the many taxation issues that Mr Howard, when he was Treasurer, did not tackle. Equitable tax reform in this area of foreign income was not introduced by the Fraser government; it had to be introduced after 1983 by the Hawke government. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7552">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After stalling on the issue for years, the Fraser government announced in 1978 that, on both equity and efficiency grounds, it would be following the Asprey committee recommendations. However, in typical fashion, it abandoned the proposal in the face of opposition from the business community in both Australia and overseas. So this blatantly unfair situation continued for a further decade until a decent government, the Labor government, had the courage and the conviction to reform and modernise the tax system, especially the international aspects of that system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Read that again!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might just acknowledge some interjections and say that I am talking about the period of the Fraser government, when the current leader of Australia, the Prime Minister, was the Treasurer. If I were sitting on the government benches, I would not raise a peep about any of this, because it was during this period that he presided over a massive haemorrhaging of the Australian taxation system and the discovery of the bottom&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;harbour tax avoidance structure. This meant that tax payments for the wealthy in Australia were entirely optional. It depended on the Australian Labor Party coming to power to sweep away that massive haemorrhaging of the Australian tax system. So, if I were part of the coalition, at this stage I would sit quiet and take my medicine on the inattention to proper tax reform which occurred in this country when they were last in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will proceed. As I said, there were three contributing factors to this previous totally unsatisfactory situation. First, there was a deficient legal regime. Until 1987, paragraph 23Q of the Income Tax Assessment Act governed whether or not foreign source income, except for dividends, was subject to Australian tax. This provision granted an exemption for foreign source income which had borne 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any foreign tax, including withholding tax. Indeed, income was exempt in Australia under this provision, even if it did not bear foreign tax but was not exempt from foreign tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in practice, foreign investments were often structured to ensure some low level of foreign tax was paid so that no Australian tax was payable. This regime made no distinction between the offshore source of the income; all investments were treated equally, whether sourced in a high-taxed OECD nation or through the most notorious tax haven. Of course, the distinction for dividends was largely academic because, if an Australian company received a dividend, it would be tax free anyway because of the dividend rebate regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the actual legal regime that applied generally applied only to income which was remitted back to Australia. So investment income could accumulate offshore outside the tax net quite legitimately for those with significant means. Meanwhile, honest PAYE taxpayers, who worked for their income, had to contribute their tax week in and week out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third aspect of this system was the lack of information to enable Australian tax authorities to ensure that offshore investments were complying with Australian tax law, weak as it was at the time. There were only a small number of double tax conventions entered into by Australia relative to the current situation and there was a generally poor level of international cooperation by taxation authorities relative to the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So tax was an option for those wealthy enough to be able to invest offshore. This anomalous situation was noted in the draft white paper on taxation reform issued by the government in 1985. At page 230 that report noted how unfair the prevailing system was and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue consequences aside, these exemptions are inequitable where the foreign income tax is lower than the Australian income tax that would otherwise be payable. It can result in markedly different tax levels as between two resident taxpayers with the same amount of income, in the one case derived from Australian sources, and in the other from foreign. The exemption runs counter to neutrality objectives, providing a tax induced 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7553"> incentive for investment abroad rather than in Australia. At the same time the exemption affords an incentive to avoid tax by arranging to give income an artificial source overseas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The system introduced by Labor to address these anomalies was comprehensive. It comprised, firstly, the foreign tax credit system, referred to as the FTCS. As I mentioned before, this was a minimum reform to ensure some justice, which the Fraser government could not achieve, even though it knew this should have been done. When this legislation came before the Senate, the then opposition voted against the proposals&mdash;that is, the now government voted against it. The coalition yet again sided with those who were not paying their fair share of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there were the controlled foreign company, or CFC, measures. The CFC measures tax Australian shareholders on their pro rata share of a CFC's tainted income, the passive income&mdash;for example, interest, royalties, et cetera&mdash;or related party sales income, whether or not that income is remitted back to the Australian shareholder. This is an important measure to ensure that moneys invested in foreign businesses cannot be accumulated in tax havens outside of the Australian tax net. It acts in addition to the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there are the foreign investment fund, or FIF, measures. The FIF measures apply to Australian shareholders who have an interest but not a controlling interest in a foreign entity&mdash;a company or a trust&mdash;that is not caught by the CFC or transferor trust measures. These rules ensure that passive offshore investment&mdash;say, in an international share trust&mdash;cannot escape taxation where equivalent investment behaviour&mdash;say, in the Australian share market through a domestic share trust&mdash;would be subject to Australian tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Labor changed the law to introduce the transferor trust measures and other measures to ensure that the taxation of interests in non-resident trusts is fair. The transferor trust measures attribute the income of a non-resident trust to an Australian resident who has transferred some value to the trust, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is a broad parallel to the CFC measures or systems concerning companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor has a proud record of cleaning up rorts in this area of international tax avoidance and the coalition has, typically, a disgraceful record&mdash;and the voting record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> demonstrates that. Given this background, I have to say that the opposition were pleasantly surprised when we saw the discussion paper released in December of last year on this issue and the final decisions announced in the 1997 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally the coalition appear to have accepted these reforms made by Labor. Whilst I condemn their previous obstructive actions, I welcome this change of direction. The process of keeping the tax system fair is an ongoing one. Bills such as the one before us today are part of the day-to-day work necessary to keep the tax net as free from holes as possible while still encouraging investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspects of the current arrangements that will be reformed by this bill include alterations to the current listing arrangements for comparable tax countries. Currently, the CFC and transferor trust regimes and the FTCS use the same list of comparable tax countries which provide too lenient treatment for the CFCs. The list for the CFC and transferor trust regimes will be reduced from approximately 50 nations to seven&mdash;this is to be known as the broad exemption list&mdash;to reflect the fact that there are many countries on the current list that do not consistently levy tax on a truly comparable basis to Australia. These countries will be known as limited exemption listed countries. The FTCS will be available on both broad exemption listed countries and limited exemption listed countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there are measures which purportedly will reduce compliance costs. Various measures are being implemented which the government claims will simplify the rules concerning calculation of income from interests in CFCs, thereby hopefully reducing compliance costs. Of course, the goal of reducing compliance costs in all areas of regulation is shared by the opposition so long as existing standards are maintained.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7554">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note various comments reported in the media about the actual effect of this legislation from some of the industry experts who will have to implement it. For example, Mr Ian Farmer, a Coopers and Lybrand tax partner, is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 11 July last to have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will require companies to conduct more detailed annual reviews of their overseas subsidiaries and will increase compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, a tax partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Mr Duncan Baxter, is also reported as saying, `You've got to be joking,' when asked if the measures would reduce compliance costs. So just like the failure of the government to deliver on its commitment to halve the compliance costs and red tape on small business, there is certainly some doubt whether this legislation will actually reduce the compliance costs of Australian firms investing overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element of this legislation concerns changes to the treatment of branch income of Australian companies operating overseas. Branches of Australian firms in a limited exemption listed country will face tougher rules for exemption of certain types of income. The taxation of branch income of Australian financial institutions will generally be brought more into line with the treatment of Australian financial institutions under the CFC regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are various consequential changes and transitional rules in the bill which are supported by the opposition. For example, taxpayers will have the option to treat states emerging from the dissolution of listed countries&mdash;examples being the former Czechoslovakia, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or Yugoslavia&mdash;as listed countries. Finally, there are changes to the foreign investment funds, or FIF, rules. Additional stock exchanges&mdash;Bogota, Colombo, Zimbabwe and Bratislava&mdash;are to be added to the list of approved stock exchanges and the existing exemption for approved country funds is to be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated revenue flowing from the above measures combined is $125 million in the 1998-99 year and $100 million in subsequent years. The opposition has received 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representations on many of the matters about which I have spoken today. I will not detain the Senate by running through them in detail because many of them relate to technical problems which the business community is concerned about with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say though that I appear before the Senate at the moment representing the shadow Treasurer in addressing this bill. If I can for a moment don my hat as the shadow trade minister, there appears to me to be some issue for questioning the government about the impact of this bill on the trade relationship between developing countries where the financial markets are not as deregulated as they would be in developed countries. Perhaps I had best pursue that matter when we come to the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note for the record that one of the things which, in the last two weeks of what has been a tumultuous recess for this Senate, has perhaps attracted less attention than it might otherwise have done&mdash;had it not been forced out by the most distracting events of a frontbench reshuffle and all that followed since we last rose&mdash;was a comment by the trade minister that the Labor Party regarded trade with Asia as trade only with Asia and that we put all of our eggs in that basket, whereas the coalition regards Asia as first but puts its eggs in many other baskets. While I do not accept that the trade minister has accurately described our position&mdash;he has adopted a convenient set of words to suit the way in which he wants to present our position&mdash;nonetheless, what the government has said is that it wants to spread its trade market more widely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be there are elements in this legislation that would require the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to look at the impact of Australian investment in developing countries where there is a more highly regulated regime about foreign investment, but I will take those matters up in the committee stage. I conclude my remarks by repeating what I said at the beginning of my comments today: this bill is not a contentious one in principle, and it is one that we support. We will be voting that way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7555"> ment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997</XREF>  we are debating proposes to address some of the tax loopholes that allow foreign sourced income to escape full taxation in Australia. The bill will modify the list of countries which are acceptable as fully comparable to Australia in the taxation of business income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, under our international tax treaty arrangements, companies and trusts from over 50 countries receive not just exemptions on profits under the foreign tax credit system, but they are also exempt from accruals taxation under controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The double use of this bill has been found by the Taxation Office to be inappropriate as not all countries have comparable tax systems for both dividend tax credit and accruals. This bill will establish a second list for providing exemptions for accrual taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures of those countries with clearly comparable tax systems. The list will comprise seven countries&mdash;all OECD countries&mdash;that make up the bulk of our foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By denying exemptions on accruals taxation to countries with not strictly comparable tax systems, the Treasury will be able to prevent about $125 million of revenue a year from being lost. The Australian Democrats welcome these measures as absolutely essential, and I advise the Senate that we will be supporting the bill. We do not, however, think that they go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) first proposed these measures in a discussion paper released on the somewhat inappropriate day of Christmas Eve last year. We responded to the Treasurer's discussion paper with our own submission in March welcoming the measures, but urging the government to do more to prevent tax revenue being lost due to certain tax advantages held by foreign corporations. In our submission we urged the government to adopt an active stance in reviewing the current set of bilateral tax treaties which in our view discriminate against a major importer of capital such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current tax treaty arrangements largely follow a formula set by the Bretton Woods agreements after World War II. Typically, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these treaties provide for withholding taxes of 10 per cent on interest and 15 per cent on dividends earned in Australia but paid to a foreign company. So, in the case of, say, dividends, Australia gets 15 per cent, and the investor's home country gets 21 per cent. These treaties in our view overwhelmingly favour the countries and the treasuries of the foreign investors' home country. That is not surprising because the big foreign investing countries were the ones, after all, that drew up the Bretton Woods formulae.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as foreign investment levels in Australia have risen, we have to be aware that with it the ability of Australia to get a fair share of tax on income earned in this country is being affected. At the end of 1997, net foreign debt has risen to over $200 billion, or nearly 40 per cent of GDP; foreign investment equity had risen to over $110 billion or nearly 21 per cent of GDP; and, combined, over 60 per cent of GDP is now either owned or effectively mortgaged to foreign investors. That is up from 45 per cent a decade ago, and 20 per cent a decade before that. To put that in perspective, 15 per cent of the Australian economy, worth about $77 billion, has moved from Australian ownership to effective foreign control in the last decade. And most of that last decade was under Labor management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that has gone control of a very large income stream. Since 1986, interest payments on net foreign debt have risen from $7.2 billion to $11.1 billion, despite markedly lower interest rates. Dividends on foreign investment have risen from $900 million to over $8.1 billion, a ninefold increase. And with all of that has gone tax revenue. About $6.3 billion is now taxed at the concessional withholding tax arrangements rather than at resident tax rates, a situation made even worse by the decision in 1986 to extend the benefits of dividend imputation to non&hyphen;resident shareholders with a total exemption from withholding tax. This is despite the fact that only four other countries&mdash;New Zealand, Finland, Greece and Norway&mdash;have followed Australia down the fiscally disastrous route of full dividend imputation. The cost of extending full dividend imputation to non&hyphen;resident 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7556"> shareholders alone is calculated at $600 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So clearly Australia has a long way to go before it comes to terms with the tax problems raised by increasing dependence on foreign capital and by globalisation. The tax office has been grappling with the tax losses, especially through such measures as transfer pricing within multinational corporations, but, frankly, without a lot of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did not respond, and now this government is yet to fully respond to the 1991 recommendations of the Martin parliamentary inquiry into withholding tax arrangements. That inquiry's report was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Follow the yellow brick road</EMPHASIS>. It estimated that there were tax losses of up to $800 million a year through withholding tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia like other major financial centres, has failed to come to terms with the tax problems caused by the increasingly globalised financial markets. Nobel Prize winning economist James Tobin has proposed a modest tax on foreign exchange transactions to act as a small disincentive to arbitrage dealing which has had the effect of unnecessarily destabilising financial markets throughout the world. His proposal had the objective of improving the efficiency of financial markets in allocating resources by discouraging short&hyphen;term capital flows and also by restoring some of the monetary and fiscal authority governments used to have prior to financial deregulation and submission to financial world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember that in 1995, as I am advised, global turnover in equities was worth $21 billion but global turnover in foreign exchange was worth a phenomenal $450 trillion. Such a tax would probably need to be implemented multilaterally and would involve a range of technical problems such as who gets the revenue and how it is to be divvyed up. But I think we need to give careful consideration to whether such a measure is appropriate for Australia. A recent major publication by a range of very senior economists from around the world found that such a tax could help to reduce market instability, as well as raise about $148 billion levied at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a 0.1 per cent rate, or $290 billion at the higher 0.25 per cent rate globally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This could provide an independent funding base for the United Nations, the World Bank and even the IMF, thereby reducing fiscal pressure on national governments who currently fund these bodies. Australia currently contributes about $433 million to the United Nations, international financial organisations and their activities. We pay nearly half a billion dollars for those institutions. So there is a big benefit there for us as well: a fiscal benefit, and the benefit that Australia, like all nations, will be a little less controlled by the erratic and often irrational sentiments of the fickle gamblers&mdash;and many of them are gamblers&mdash;on world financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving a second reading amendment urging Treasury to have a close look at all of these sorts of issues and to report back to parliament within six months. I think it is essential that the tax reform debate look not just at domestic taxation but at the equally important taxes issues raised by Australia's position in the global economy, the global market and the global financial market. I hope that the Senate will support my second reading amendment, and that the government will give serious consideration to the issues presented to the Treasurer in our March paper. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murray and Senator Cook for their contributions to the debate. I will quickly summarise the merits of the changes that are to be made in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R285">Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . The government believes that the changes will improve the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7557"> effectiveness of the rules for the accruals taxation of foreign source income, thereby helping to ensure that investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improving the effectiveness of the rules will also help to stem the erosion of the Australian tax base that could otherwise occur through payments from Australian profits to foreign subsidiaries. In this regard, the changes are expected to result in revenue gains of about $125 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $100 million in the outyears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The creation of a shorter list of countries for providing exemptions from accruals taxation could, however, result in some increase in overall compliance costs for companies and trusts in limited exemption listed countries. These costs are considered necessary to protect the revenue. It is also relevant to note that most of the additional compliance burden will be borne by the Australian controllers of foreign companies that derive significant amounts of tainted income. These companies are the legitimate target of the controlled foreign companies measures. Compliance costs will not increase for all foreign companies controlled by Australian residents. The changes being made to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures are likely to result in an overall reduction in compliance costs for most companies in the broad exemption list of countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be supporting Senator Murray's second reading amendment. As a government, we are committed to ensuring that Australia receives its fair share of revenue. When we debate the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  , with the thin capitalisation measures, in the Senate later this week, we will certainly be addressing the concern that is raised in part (a) of Senator Murray's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the tax on international financial transactions is concerned&mdash;which Senator Murray referred to as the Tobin proposal&mdash;the government is actively involved in looking at the tax treatment of financial transactions. From my point of view, I do not regard short&hyphen;term movements in financial transactions as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being against the interests of international trade and the world economy. I think they serve a very important purpose and we have to be very careful to ensure that we do not put unnecessary constraints on those. Both the fair share of revenue and the continuing treatment of tax on international financial transactions are very much ongoing processes and the Senate, by passing this amendment, would not achieve anything.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadowed, firstly informally before we started and then in my speech during the second reading stage, that I had a question relating to Chile and the impact of this legislation which comes under schedule 2, foreign investment funds. For the information of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell), I have a letter from a management fund, Genesis Management Australia Ltd, which, from the tone of it, although it does not say explicitly, would be in the possession of the government because it is a letter related to the information paper released in December last year by the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, on the subject of proposed changes to the taxation of foreign source income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to read the letter&mdash;it is quite a long letter and has attached to it a fairly thick submission&mdash;but I do think it raises a relevant point which gives rise to a series of appropriate questions. In this letter, the authors say that they submit that the FIF exemption of their fund, the Genesis Chile Fund Ltd, should not be withdrawn, but should be granted in an alternative form. They go on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission notes that in the case of Chile the proposed change would be revenue neutral in that existing investors in Chile via Genesis Chile Fund Limited would be obliged to withdraw their investments. The removal of the exemption would only close to Australian investors a currently legitimate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7558"> commercial activity with no evident compensating benefits either to the commercial sector or the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on in the letter to refer to a report by Langton Clarke y Cia Ltda, which, I understand, is a major Chilean chartered accountant firm based in Santiago and an associate of Coopers &amp; Lybrand internationally. They say that the report demonstrates that there has been no investment liberalisation in Chile; and a series of points are made&mdash;I will read them but they are (a) to (f)&mdash;all of which point to what the lack of investment liberalisation in Chile is and what the requirements are of foreign investors. I have identified this letter and the accompanying submission because I believe it would be in the government's possession. Let me quote from the concluding paragraph of this letter where the author, Mr G.C. Harrison, who is the Director of Genesis, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that we have demonstrated in this material that the investment conditions in Chile under which FIF exemption was granted to Genesis Chile Fund Limited have not changed, and that accordingly Section 513 and Schedule 11 of the Income Tax Regulations should not be repealed in respect of Genesis Chile Fund Limited.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask Senator Campbell: firstly, to his knowledge, has the trade minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade been alerted to the impact these measures would have on investment in Chile; secondly, what is the government's response to the submissions made by Genesis Management Australia Ltd in their submission; thirdly, do they concur with the conclusions that Genesis Management Australia Ltd draw on the impact of this legislation on their Chilean investments?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In speaking to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R237">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I draw to the Senate's attention that TAFE is very much in crisis in this country. This bill is at the heart of that crisis. It provides no growth funding whatsoever for TAFE. Of course, this is very much in line with the government's decisions. The Howard government is abandoning the commitment that the Commonwealth made under Labor's ANTA agreement&mdash;an agreement which is still in place&mdash;and that is that the Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7560"> would `provide growth funding on a continuing basis'. There is no doubt that funding for growth is required, but this government has ignored that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) admits that some 60,000 people missed out on TAFE places last year. Yet, last month Dr Kemp bludgeoned and blackmailed the states and territories into agreeing to a funding arrangement for TAFE which requires all future growth to be funded from so&hyphen;called efficiencies; this after three months of overblown rhetoric by Dr Kemp that some $300 million in efficiencies can be made annually if only the states and territories would get their houses in order. The facts are very simple. Dr Kemp has now retreated somewhat from that claim. No doubt the new Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Senator Ellison)&mdash;I congratulate him on his appointment&mdash;will have to deal with that backdown by Dr Kemp. He has left you with a very dirty mess to clean up, Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that Dr Kemp has been forced to back down from his campaign against the states and against TAFE colleges. A recent briefing paper prepared by the Australian National Training Authority says of the $300 million claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If growth in VET is to be funded by efficiencies alone, reductions in average recurrent expenditure per annum hour curriculum of between 3.8 per cent and 7.9 per cent would be required. The capacity of the states and territories to deliver efficiency gains of this order within a single calendar year is problematic. Analysis based on the assumption that all states and territories would deliver training at the cost of the most efficient state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, Victoria&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suggest that there is considerable scope for efficiency savings. However, the rate at which these efficiencies can be realised and the extent to which efficiency gains are restricted by cost drivers will in practice substantially reduce the potential efficiencies identified.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The paper pulled the rug out from under Dr Kemp and this government's entire argument when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on a state and territory's budget system that is not available. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, ANTA does not know whether the scope really exists for efficiency savings it has theoretically identified. The minister does not know. I challenge the new minister to tell this Senate whether he in fact knows now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover the benchmark&mdash;the so&hyphen;called low cost state; the model which is the gospel, according to Dr Kemp, that all states and territories have to emulate in order to make these theoretical savings&mdash;is, of course, Victoria. How is it that Victoria became the cost model? It became the cost model largely by adopting a ruthless approach to vocational education expenditure very similar to the approach it has followed in schools. TAFE colleges&mdash;which provide a valuable service to their local communities as a point of access to continuing education and training&mdash;which did not meet the Kennett definition of efficiency were closed or `amalgamated'&mdash;which, of course, is another Kennett term&mdash;all over regional Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assault is still going on in Victoria. The Victorian government is currently considering a proposal to merge Melbourne's 14 TAFE institutes into eight and possibly five in a move which the Victorian training minister admits is related to cost cutting. It is directly related to cost cutting. This whole approach to vocational educational and training, like the Howard government's approach to higher education, is essentially input focused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Dr Kemp talks about the need to improve quality, yet the benchmarking measures he is forcing on the states are entirely focused on costs. I ask this new minister whether this is his approach as well. Nothing demonstrates this better than the results of the national employer satisfaction survey conducted in late 1995 and early 1996 by AGB McNair and funded by ANTA. It is extremely interesting to note how well Dr Kemp's star state system performed. When it came to the question of the quality and relevance of an emasculated TAFE system, it was judged by employers that Victoria performed worse than any other state in the Commonwealth. On the 21 criteria, Victoria ranked worse than the average 12 or 57 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7561">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on the question of supervisor satisfaction about the extent to which the course fitted in with work commitments, there was an Australia&hyphen;wide level of 74 per cent, yet Victoria rated at 65 per cent. The benchmark state ranked second lowest in the country when supervisors were asked about the relevance of the skills to the current needs of organisations and second lowest on the issue of job readiness of graduates. Both employers and supervisors ranked Victoria far below the national average on the question of the cost-effectiveness of the training provided, and that is really the key of this whole issue. There is a direct relationship between cost cutting and the cutting of quality in our TAFE system, but this government's actions have fundamentally undermined the quality of TAFE provisions in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult then to escape the conclusion about all of this cost cutting. It has produced, as I said, the very disturbing proposition that this government's real agenda is the privatisation of the education system at all levels&mdash;driven essentially by an ideological obsession, that has no basis, based on the provision of quality education services for all Australians. It is an obsession about reducing the quality of education, which is a direct consequence of its policy of cost cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we turn to the negotiations of 25 September, what do we see in terms of the Commonwealth's cutback program? Its funding guarantee of five years has been reduced to a funding guarantee of only three years. This is hardly a big concession. It is not putting in 1c of its own money for any growth in the system. We have not seen that the Commonwealth has given ground, which is what Dr Kemp's media releases would have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is that Dr Kemp is now dropping his demand for 500,000 additional places over five years. He has actually given himself less room to grandstand and to make political capital as a consequence. You might say that the minister for headlines has, in these circumstances, made a major concession. What the states have done is put the finger right on Dr Kemp. They have identified 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearly what he is. When talking about the federal minister, Dr Phil Honeywood said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories have just given up, basically. Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each Minister's meeting . . . and hits us with another bombshell that we haven't agreed upon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And another Liberal state minister&mdash;in fact from Dr Kemp's home state&mdash;has accused the federal minister of engaging in cynical, political stunts, motivated by attention&hyphen;grabbing self-promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does all this leave our TAFE system and the people who use it? It leaves TAFE in crisis and, as I said earlier, it leaves a government committed to undermining and white&hyphen;anting the training facilities in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should make no mistake about the consequences of this action. The government is talking about a fundamental change to one of the most important educational infrastructure facilities that it ought to have a responsibility to provide. There were 1.3 million Australians involved in vocational education and training courses last year, and a further 400,000 were undertaking non-accredited courses. TAFE accounts for some 94 per cent of the student contact hours in vocational education and training, according to information provided by the National Schools Statistics Collection which monitors these areas. People with TAFE qualifications outnumber those with a university qualification by more than two to one and TAFE graduates have a higher rate of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have got is a system that meets very high levels of social equity in terms of the targeting of its arrangements. One witness told the Senate inquiry into the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the graduates of TAFE in 1995, 55 per cent were female, 27 per cent of them came from a non&hyphen;English speaking background, six per cent had a disability and 1.6 per cent were Aboriginal. That is a pretty impressive little bundle of statistics to demonstrate the importance of TAFE in the community . . . Anything that is going to impact on TAFE resources will impact immediately on those target groups, many or most of whom will have nowhere else to go&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the ABS survey of TAFE graduate outcomes for 1994, the average age of TAFE graduates was 29 years, with 11 per cent of graduates being over the age of 44. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7562"> The survey also highlighted the increasing significance of TAFE in providing particular skills to people who had previously completed a university education, with some five per cent of graduates having completed a bachelor or higher degree before the commencement of their TAFE programs. By inadequately resourcing TAFE, the Howard government is effectively abandoning one of the most important roles it can play in Australia's current and future interests&mdash;that is, ensuring the appropriate provision of quality education and training for all our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot from this government about competition. Government schools must compete with non-government counterparts. TAFE must compete with private providers. Putting aside the important issue of whether education can work effectively as an open market&mdash;which I say it cannot&mdash;what you do not hear from this government is how it is stacking the deck against public providers. While state governments are closing public schools which they say have too few students, the federal government is funding private schools with far fewer enrolments. TAFEs are being expected, on a similar basis, with reduced funding, to continue their traditional role of providing broad access to adult education, while at the same time competing with private providers to meet the needs of employers. As the Pro&hyphen;Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Vocational Education and Training at the RMIT told the Senate inquiry on 5 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a substantial decrease in capital funds for VET. That is a concern to us because of the old stock that we have . . . if we are going to go into a competitive trading market, we are competing with other providers that may be up to date with buildings, facilities and equipment, whereas we have been left with a fairly run&hyphen;down situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government's privatisation agenda is clearly recognised by the states. The Victorian training minister, Dr Honeywood, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 13 June as questioning whether the Commonwealth's aim was to `dismantle the TAFE system by squeezing it to produce impossible efficiencies while encouraging private providers to take over training'. Dr Honeywood has also given us his views about Dr Kemp's approach to nego 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tiations, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  of 29 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Kemp is a total centralist. He reminds me very much of the former prime minister Billy Hughes. When he didn't want to hear something he turned his hearing aid off.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even Jeff Kennett&mdash;my old sparring partner&mdash;weighed in. It is strange that he and I agree on anything, but what we do see is that Dr Kemp's behaviour has been identified as being childish and stupid. Such behaviour has now been rewarded with Dr Kemp being elevated to the position of a senior portfolio minister. In other words, bullying, arrogance, distorting the truth, cutting funds and re-announcing old initiatives are the hallmarks of achievement in the Howard government. Senator Ellison, let this be a lesson to you. Emulate your senior minister and you too will be rewarded for backstabbing your colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should remember that the most vehement criticisms of Dr Kemp have not come from ALP ministers or from Labor premiers but from political colleagues from his home state. It is almost as if they know him best. The states and territories with conservative governments were in a state of near rebellion in their dealings with the federal Labor government, but it is interesting that the then federal Labor government was prepared to properly invest in education and training and to back up its policy directions with sufficient resources. This government came into office having promised to&mdash;and I quote directly from its policy platform:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of TAFE institutions . . . and to ensure that the network of TAFE institutions, especially in rural and regional centres, will not be undermined and that TAFE will continue its traditional role as a provider of further education and second chance educational opportunity, particularly for disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those were the promises, but what we have seen over the last two budgets bears no relation to that. We have seen reductions in funding to TAFE of over $240 million. We have seen $1.6 million cut from the financial assistance grants to the states, further reducing the states' capacities to fund their TAFE systems. The states and territories traditionally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7563"> spend around 3.5 per cent of their FAGs on TAFE. So the $1.6 million cut announced last June equates to some $56 million less for public provision of vocational education and training&mdash;on top of the other budgetary cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that TAFE is in fact facing a crisis. It is under assault from this Howard government, a government which refuses to accept or acknowledge its responsibility to invest sufficient resources in educating and training young Australians. Under this government, the entire VET sector is being pushed towards low cost, short&hyphen;term approaches which will damage our skills base as well as reduce educational opportunities for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate to support the opposition's second reading amendment, which calls on the government to erode the key planks of our future prosperity by narrow&hyphen;minded and short&hyphen;term cost funding. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the opinion that TAFE has a vital role to play in providing employment skills and opportunities for lifelong learning; and</PARA>

It might appear on the surface to be just a mechanical means by which we provide some $890 million, but what it does do is go to the issue of the ideological debate that is occurring within education and the ideological obsessions of this government to actually undermine the TAFE sector, to privatise the TAFE sector and, as a consequence, to undermine the quality of education and training

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just for the benefit of Senator Carr and the opposition, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment before us today. I would also like to congratulate the new minister on his appointment. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R237">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill</XREF> , which is before us today, provides base funding for a new ANTA agreement and the funding basis, of course, for the Commonwealth's contribution to TAFE. We know that approximately $3 billion a year is spent on this area with a Commonwealth component of around $1 billion. TAFE, of course, makes up around 95 per cent of the total funds that are provided to the vocational education sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, to date, this government has reduced vocational education and training grants to the states and territories and it has abolished the five per cent real growth that was available for TAFE. The government has also cut ANTA's operating expenses by around $12 million in its first budget and followed this in the most recent budget with the $72 million benchmarking efficiencies. Vocational education and training funding has been cut by 2.2 per cent in real terms between 1996 and 2001. This is already on top of a government's projected and implemented cuts to the labour market programs of around $1.8 billion over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr referred, the committee inquiry into this bill revealed that the funding levels proposed will not meet the level of demand for the sector. The federal government is proposing that growth should be funded by the states through so-called efficiencies, despite the findings of the KPMG consultancy report undertaken by ANTA which showed that the level of underfunding is already quite substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By agreement with the states and the Commonwealth, the ANTA Act was implemented in 1992. The Democrats played a role in that too. In fact, we were keen to ensure that that bill was passed, provided there was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7564"> appropriate scrutiny of that particular legislation and of ANTA's role. ANTA provides obligations on both the states and the territories and on the Commonwealth itself for the provision of funding for vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act does provide an obligation on the states to maintain their 1992 funding effort for the provision of vocational education and training in this country. It also provides for the Commonwealth to provide growth funds on a continuing basis. Now the Kemp plan commits the Commonwealth to a guaranteed level of funding of around $900 million annually for the next five years on the condition that the states and territories increase student places by around 500,000, but this is not accompanied by growth funds from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Minister Kemp, all this growth must be funded from the states and territories through the so&hyphen;called efficiency gains. The Democrats believe Minister Kemp's ultimatum contravenes the spirit of the original ANTA agreement. In fact, it is simply a threat to the states and territories. But the schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Act actually states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will provide growth funding on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 5 August this year, in evidence presented to the Senate committee considering the bill, the Australian Education Union stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . certainly there seems to have been a moral breach in relation to the obligations of the Commonwealth government to provide those growth funds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The union president, Ms Sharon Burrow, went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you look at . . . the cuts to TAFE over the budget, the labour market program cuts and the effect on TAFE in particular and the VET sector more broadly, the efficiency demand from the federal government of some $300 million, and you contrast that . . . with the unmet demand of 65,000 places from last year, the 100,000 additional places demanded by ANTA in terms of the current agreement round and the additional unknown demand driven by the youth training allowance and the changes to the dole, you see that we have a breakdown in the Commonwealth&hyphen;state partnership. We have states who say they are simply unable to meet those expectations and we have a Common 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wealth that is driving those expectations, and the government is not prepared to fund the public policy base.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Democrats, as I mentioned, supported the implementation of ANTA and we expected the Commonwealth to work hand in hand with the states and territories and, of course, the TAFE networks. We were pleased at that time, in 1992, the former government recognised and acknowledged its responsibilities in relation to the TAFE sector. However, we were concerned that ANTA should not simply be another level of government bureaucracy. We were keen to ensure that ANTA was open and accountable, and of course available for parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the Australian Education Union, the Democrats know there is no point in the government urging people to get further education and training, and in particular further and technical education, if the government does not provide the necessary resources, that is, if the necessary resources are not there to ensure that these additional numbers are trained or educated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats express grave concern when it comes to the full ramifications of this bill. We believe they have not been examined adequately by the government&mdash;specifically, the impact, for example, of the government's common youth allowance policy. What kind of an impact will the CYA have on demand for the TAFE and other education sectors? What are the implications of the common youth allowance on young people and of course their families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approximately 60,000 people missed out on TAFE places this year. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research stated that there has been unmet demand of around 8.3 per cent for this sector in recent years. This compares with the higher education sector which has had an unmet demand of around 3.1 per cent over the last few years but, according to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, 9.2 per cent of the 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age group were unable to get a place in the TAFE system over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Commonwealth's common youth allowance potentially abolishing financial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7565"> support for those young people&mdash;certainly those between 16 and 18 not in education, employment or training&mdash;they are not being offered any real solutions; especially if these young people are not going to have access to TAFE or other education and training places. This is a concern not only of the Democrats, but of the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Students, the AEU, and it has been echoed by Minister Kemp's state and territory counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr said, the Victorian state minister for training, Phil Honeywood, claims there could be another 15,000 students in Victoria alone who cannot be accepted into the TAFE and vocational education sector. They will not be able to be catered for&mdash;15,000 are going to miss out. But he also remarks that it is estimated that around 40,000 young people could qualify for the Commonwealth's common youth allowance, if they enrol in TAFE, and that would cost the state of Victoria an additional $70 million per year. We are concerned that the federal government is not prepared for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am yet to see any evidence from the government that they have considered the impact of the common youth allowance on young people and their families generally, let alone the TAFE sector in particular and the higher education sector. So, apart from the proposals that this government has put forward that basically sweep young people under the carpet&mdash;whether it is a year 13 idea, or botching and fiddling the figures so that we have hidden unemployment or underemployment&mdash;I have yet to see any realistic policies from this government that look after that increased and unmet demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact the federal government is holding the states and the territories to ransom on this issue, demanding that the states pick up the shortfall, and abrogating its own Commonwealth responsibilities as laid out in the various acts. It is already clear that these responsibilities will not be picked up by anyone. To expect young people to be further supported by their families, specifically in relation to income support, is absolutely outrageous. It is anachronistic and, of course, it is quite callous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Kemp's plan was viewed quite rightly by the states as a way of forcing them to deliver up to 40 per cent more TAFE places; there are roughly about 1.2 million currently. This is with no extra funds from the Commonwealth and on top of the funding cuts that the states have already had to sustain of around $72 million over the next four years. While Dr Kemp has insisted that the states do not reject his federal plan I think it is pretty obvious from the joint resolution in June from the state training ministers that they quite clearly doubt that they could produce the 500,000 new places that they are expected to produce over the next five years. Dr Kemp has maintained his estimate that around $300 million can be saved through efficiencies, but I have to state that the Democrats agree with the state ministers that this money cannot necessarily be found through the so&hyphen;called efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major cost in the vocational education and training system is labour, of course. On average, about 80 per cent of the TAFE operating costs are salary costs, so it is a great concern that the states are compared with the lowest common denominator, that is, with the state of Victoria, when it comes to setting the lowest benchmark. All these states are compared against Victoria. Isn't it worrying that that is the one that has been chosen to compare against? In that state there has been an offer of around a 10 per cent salary increase for teaching and non&hyphen;teaching staff. Average costs in the benchmark state are, therefore, set to rise between eight and 12 per cent. According to the evidence presented to the committee by Mr Des Fooks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only does this create a negative capacity to fund growth in Victoria, it destroys the arithmetic for savings in all other states and territories. Clearly savings through efficiency gains will neither reach the required volume nor be released quickly enough to satisfy the resource requirements of the level of growth in student numbers being demanded by Kemp. In some states they will not even be sufficient to meet unavoidable cost increases.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The federal government is deliberately ignoring the significant effort that TAFE has already made in the name of efficiency. The evidence presented by the National Tertiary Education Union, specifically by Jane Nic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7566"> holls, showed that over the period 1991 to 1994 there was a percentage growth in contact hours in the VET system of 21 per cent nation wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a similar period, enrolments increased by 16 per cent. However, teaching staff in the VET system as a whole increased by only 8.4 per cent and non&hyphen;teaching staff increased more rapidly. It appears that these so-called efficiencies have already been obtained. So, as Mr Fooks has cautioned, we must be careful that we do not start placing efficiencies before quality&mdash;and I suspect that that is already happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AEU raised concerns, which the Democrats share, regarding the high casualisation of the teaching and non&hyphen;teaching staff in the TAFE sector. In New South Wales alone more than half of the total teaching staff is casual. I do not think we can really attempt to try to trim fat from bone. I think most of the efficiencies have already been gained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ignoring this concern, on 5 September Minister Kemp gave the states until the end of that month to respond to his funding offer. He is petulantly threatening the states that he will withdraw this offer after that time. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program Jeff Kennett, when obviously commenting on the ministerial reshuffle, had a few things to say about the new minister Dr David Kemp. Perhaps I will leave it to Senator Carr to comment on Jeff Kennett.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Isn't it true of this government that, instead of recognising education and training as the great equaliser, as the one opportunity to empower those groups that have been traditionally under&hyphen;represented, unrepresented or locked out of those education and training opportunities, instead of giving them the opportunities, they are placing barriers in their path&mdash;whether it is in the form of fees and charges or cuts to operating grants in the higher education sector or cuts and slashes to TAFE in the form of efficiencies, or even expecting the states and territories to increase the number of places available for young people hoping to undertake some form of education and training, yet providing no additional funds through which the states and territories can actually meet these particular challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has poured millions of dollars into failed private companies like South Pacific Cruise Lines, held the TAFE sector to ransom, cut operating grants for the higher education sector and forced universities to introduce up-front and full cost fees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Training Authority was enacted in 1992 as an agreement on funding levels between the states and the Commonwealth. The states were to maintain 1992 funding levels and the Commonwealth was to provide growth funding on a continuous basis. The government has decided to hold funding at around $900 million for the next three years and, at the same time, call for the states and territories, and in particular TAFE, to increase places by 100,000 a year with no growth funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the committee inquiry into this  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill  and the consultancy report commissioned by ANTA found that current funding levels are already inadequate for the projected level of demand in this sector. Let us not forget that the government already cut ANTA operating expenses by $12 million in the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is violating both the spirit and the substance of the ANTA agreement by withholding growth funds, despite the fact that there was unmet demand of 60,000 places last year. What sort of cruel joke are the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Kemp, and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Senator Ellison, attempting to play on people by encouraging them to undertake TAFE studies and adult education while refusing to provide the resources to enable the provision of quality education. Dr Kemp, the minister who introduced this bill, had claimed that $300 million in efficiency savings would help fund up to 100,000 extra places a year over the next five years. He calls that $300 million of fat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja that there is already a high level of casualisation within the TAFE sector. What does this mean in terms of education outcomes and student outcomes? This is what we should be asking. What does it mean in terms of the basic conditions of work for those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who are under those conditions? It means that more and more people are being employed on an hourly basis to only provide the lecture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not get paid extra hours to prepare. They do not get extra hours necessarily to provide student contact hours, although there might be others in the more permanent staff who provide this. They do not necessarily get paid for ongoing development. You have a situation where this cannot possibly be good for quality education and training outcomes. It cannot possibly be good for the level of morale of those people whose job is to provide quality education and training outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what you do is try to plug in on a needs basis lecture by lecture, there is obviously going to be a real problem of continuity, a real problem of commitment for people who do not know what their next contract will be, and a real problem with course development&mdash;people continually having to reinvent the same wheels. The fact is that the great majority of costs in the TAFE sector are, as was mentioned, labour costs. With both teaching and non-teaching staff already deserving wage rises, states will be hard&hyphen;pressed to meet cost increases, let alone fund increased places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard that the common youth allowance is going to create its own demand. In relation to this the government said, `These kids are not unemployed. They are either at school or they do not exist.' That is effectively what they are saying. And where are these kids going to go? Where are our young people going to go if at the same time the government is, in effect, trying to make the TAFE sector do a lot more with less? It is ridiculous to assume that you can bring in something like a common youth allowance and then not provide for the education and training outcomes that will obviously be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been significant efficiencies made already in both contact hours and enrolments in the vocational education and training sector since 1991. How much further does Dr Kemp expect he can push overworked staff before quality of education starts to unavoidably decline or decline even fur 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7568"> ther? The WA State School Teachers Union President, Mr Brian Lindberg, has informed us that in my state of Western Australia the government's proposal, which amounts to providing an extra 22,000 places in TAFE without funding, would cripple TAFE provision in WA from next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue of major concern with regard to the reduction in funding contained in this bill is that there is still, to this government's shame, a long way to go before the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the ongoing requests of the Aboriginal community are implemented in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education and vocational training. In particular, the recognition of the legitimate and important role which the commission identified for independent Aboriginal community controlled forms of education and training continues to receive insufficient attention or support in policies and funding priorities. Without sufficient growth funding, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled systems of adult education and training will once again miss out on desperately needed funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This makes economic sense in the medium and long term. Of course it does because providing that support base is a lot cheaper than looking at the social outcomes of not providing that support base. Otherwise, this government, by shutting its ears to community concerns, is going to lurch from crisis to crisis and say, `We didn't know.' Remember this is the government that stopped community groups from speaking out. This is the government that more and more is threatening the funding of a large number of sectors across the community if they speak out or even give feedback to the government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have had conversations and briefs from groups such as Tranby College in Redfern and the Institute for Aboriginal Development which indicate that capital works funds are of critical need for these innovative and essential service providers. These groups are very fearful that reductions in funding contained in this bill will make it near impossible for capital works funds to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made available, especially now that they have to compete with a TAFE sector which is going to be extremely cash strapped. Once again, this government has slashed funding without any consideration for the effects on the most disadvantaged people in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 2 of this bill allocates a maximum of $21.5 million for off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. Yet these off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job programs are for conditional apprenticeships where the training provider is chosen by the employer and must be in areas of enterprising industries where economic growth exists. Clearly, job creation schemes should not be restricted to enterprising industries. Long&hyphen;term skills and socially useful employment are also found in community services, public sector employment, landcare and environment programs, tourism, accommodation and cultural industries and the expansion of plantation forests for the timber industry's long-term viability and the protection of old-growth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the current cost of apprenticeships we are going to end up with a situation in the not too distant future where skilled trades people will have reached the age of retirement and suddenly there will be debates in this chamber about the cost to industry of skilled trades people. We will have this debate about getting people into the country who can provide cheap trades and cheap skills for industry. We are walking into this with our eyes open, but it seems that the government is walking into this with its eyes closed. It is time for a change. I indicate that I will be supporting the opposition's second reading amendment. It is a very reasonable amendment, and I do believe the Senate should support it.</PARA>

Will you outline to the Senate the kinds of projects which young Australians will have the opportunity to participate in, and the benefit that they will receive?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7570" SPEAKER="Ellison, Sen Chris" NAMEID="9X5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McGauran for his very good question. This government is proud to support projects which will assist young unemployed Australians. Work for the dole is a landmark scheme which will promote a work ethic and give young people an opportunity to engage in the community rather than being isolated from it. It has the strong support of the Australian community. Australians across the nation have embraced it. They want to support young unemployed people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 10,000 places will be available to participants. The initiative is based on mutual obligation. It is fair and just that people receiving unemployment benefits from the community be asked to make a contribution to the community in return. The federal government provided $21.6 million for work for the dole. The number of projects has more than doubled from the originally planned 70 to 178. This is due to the overwhelming number of applications, which numbered 630. I am particularly pleased that 19 projects have been approved in my home state of Western Australia and that 834 unemployed people will be assisted by the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of projects in the west will include a City of Bunbury enhancement project, which will assist with environmental protection and local tourism; the Kununurra Botanic Gardens work experience project, which will involve the planting of native trees, landscaping, fencing and general beautification of the area; and improving the quality of life for residents of the Amaroo Cottages for Senior Citizens, including conducting activities for aged people, gardening and maintenance and administrative services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some sponsors have indicated that they are able to start their projects immediately and will be able to recruit participants in the next few weeks. Other projects will start over the next few months. Participants must have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7571"> unemployed for at least six months and not be in training or employment assistance programs. Those who are aged between 18 and 20 will work two six-hour days each week. Those aged 21 or more will work 2&half; days each week. Each participant will receive their newstart allowance plus an extra $10 a week for any minor costs, including travel expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their submission, project bidders had to demonstrate their experience and credentials in working with young people, their ability to foster links with local community organisations, and also how their project will not risk local paid jobs. They also had to indicate how they would continue to support participants after the project had finished. Projects must provide participants with a variety of tasks, challenges and responsibility, and also opportunities to work in teams and mix with people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person may be required to participate in a work for the dole project only if he or she is in receipt of the full unemployment allowance and there is no risk to personal health or any contravention of occupational health and safety laws.

<ANSWER PAGE="7571" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for the question. No, they will not be forced to sell their homes. Even before these changes, more than half the people going into nursing homes sold their homes; under Labor's policy, more than half sold their homes. This is the usual scare campaign&mdash;not based on fact but based on rhetoric&mdash;that has been frightening old people in this country. It is true that an old person does not want to be concerned with forms and regulations. When people become aged, they and their relatives have a real concern, and the disinformation that the opposition has been putting forth has frightened everybody in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not true that people will be forced to sell their homes. Older people can choose to sell their homes and pay part of the money for an accommodation bond. This can be a sensible choice&mdash;and one that they have already been making&mdash;as the nursing home is their new home and most residents will stay there for two to three years. People who sell their home can use some of the money to pay an accommodation bond, knowing that most of it will be returned to them or to their estate later. They can invest the rest of the money to provide extra comforts and security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to Labor's scaremongering, Social Security data shows overwhelmingly that older people who do sell their home do not lose their pensions and actually have more money to live on. Selling the home is one choice but by no means the only one. Like all financial decisions people make throughout their lives, it is important to consider which option suits them best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People can fund a bond from other assets, and most residents who can be asked to pay a bond have other assets in addition to their home. In fact, most older people have other assets above the minimum asset level for accommodation bonds of $22,500. Most older people who can be asked to pay a bond also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7572"> have income on top of their pension. They can choose to pay a bond as a higher weekly or monthly figure, or as a combination of lump sum and higher fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Different options will suit people in different circumstances, and it is important that they have flexibility. For instance, a typical older person who has a home will have some other assets and some other income. It might suit them to pay a small lump sum and then to make a modest periodic payment from renting their home or from their other income. The government is also looking at products such as reverse mortgages, which would enable older people to use the equity in their home to fund the bond without having to sell their home. We have already had some discussions with financial institutions about what might be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is back to the scare campaign and back to the disinformation, because that is all those opposite have to go on. They are ignoring the rapid ageing of the population just as they have ignored everything when they were in government. That is their answer to the rapidly ageing population and the crisis that is occurring in nursing homes in this country, which we inherited when we came into government 18 months ago. That is what we inherited. We are taking action which will be in the long-term interests of the whole of the population of this country; we are not just doing it for expeditious means. We have an answer to the problem. We are being constructive. We are looking to the future of this country and to the future of the nursing home industry which was run down under the previous Labor administration.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Synon for a very important question which throws into stark relief the opposition's policy on the issue and that of the government. The fact is it will benefit consumers very considerably because the Prices Surveillance Authority and its successor, the ACCC, have said that the price differential between Australia and the US on top selling CDs after tax is about $7. The bureau of communications has said that we could expect price reductions of between $1.60 and $3.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has to be in the best interests of the consumers. It stands to reason: if you open up the market, if you destroy a cosy cartel, if you actually allow people to import what they want to import and not have to go through the record companies who stall them, then what you will find is that prices will find their own level. Indeed, what is more likely to happen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7573"> is that lower prices will mean that there will be a greater sales volume and, as a result, there will be much better news for not only consumers but also retail stores and jobs generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an example of the current price differential, my office last week identified a top selling CD by the award winning band Savage Garden&mdash;remember they were the band that was not picked up by any of the major record companies in this country and had to go offshore, which is a bit like silverchair who had to rely on Triple J to actually get promotion. That top selling CD by Savage Garden retailed for $30 in Canberra but on the same day was purchased in New Zealand for $18.90, in Los Angeles for $23 and on the Internet for $17. So there could not be a starker contrast between the price of CDs in this country and the price of one of our nearest neighbours, New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does all this say about the opposition? It tells you that once again they are gutless. They are not interested in the right policy outcomes. They are not interested in putting consumers first. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> got it right today on Mr Beazley's performance, in saying he would oppose the government's changes, when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the politics of the photo opportunity, unfortunately. It is not a serious response to a worthwhile micro-economic reform . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are lot of people out there who support us, not least of those is someone who has been rather quiet this time around but, back in 1991, this is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ARIA has been conducting what I could only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry which, in my view, has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, Senator Schacht was dead right then and he is dead right now. I wish him all the very best, if he can hang in in shadow cabinet together with Mr Crean, Mr Ferguson, Mr Latham&mdash;all of those who know what the right policy outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of Mr Beazley's leadership on this and a whole range of other issues is that he simply is not capable of inspiring anyone 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or of setting an example. You do not have to take my word for it; just look at the front-page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last Saturday and there are the words of former Senator Kernot where she is quoted as saying, `Kim has got to believe a bit more than other people believe he can do it.'

In fact, the policy that we in government introduced in relation to nursing homes is no more nor less than the policy the Labor Party introduced in relation to hostels, and the bonds policy is the same.

Labor had an inquiry into this and appointed Professor Gregory to report on it. What did he report? In essence he said that Labor's response was a failure. They had cut funding on capital expenditure while not allowing nursing home providers to charge a bond. In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital purposes, but by 1995&hyphen;96 this had dropped to $10.7 million. That is a 75 per cent reduction in that short time. They wonder now, and they scoff that there is a crisis. Even worse, only $2.7 million of that was for upgrading old and substandard services; the rest was for building new services.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer the minister to the recent article by Lenore Taylor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  in relation to environmental conditions for the proposed Jabiluka Uranium Mine within Kakadu National Park. For example, Ms Taylor referred to the fact that your condition that `ERA must ensure that the Jabiluka proposal does not have any adverse impact on the world heritage values of Kakadu National Park' has been watered down to the extent that the condition now is that it must be `reasonably practicable'. Is it true that of the 77 recommendations you made with regard to environmental protection in the mine proposal the vast majority have been watered down to such an extent that they are now virtually meaningless and their implementation will largely be determined by economic factors associated with the project?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

As the honourable senator said, I made in excess of 70 separate recommendations to my colleague Senator Parer, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in relation to the Jabiluka proposal.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that it is also a development that can be and is to be conducted according to the highest environmental standards. It has been approved on the basis that there will be no detrimental effect to nearby world heritage values. That is the basis on which I made my recommendations to Senator Parer. As Senator Margetts knows, it is my responsibility under both the convention and the legislation to ensure that that is the case. I have powers to ensure that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experience of the nearby Ranger mine is that uranium mining and processing can take place in that region in a way that does not cause environmental damage beyond the mine site. We have had 15 years of monitoring by the Office of the Supervising Scientist to give us confidence in that fact. In fact, this is probably the most closely monitored mining region of the world in relation to uranium mines. So the Australian people can have great confidence that this mining will be carried out without environmental damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I simply remind the senator that there is not a separate processing plant attached to this new ore source. Jabiluka will simply be providing an ore source that will be processed in the existing Ranger facility. Therefore, there is not the need for further plant of that type or for a   further tailings dam, which in many ways makes it&mdash;I think that Senator Margetts would even agree&mdash;a much better environmental prospect than having to address a whole new plant, tailings dam and the like. I also should mention that

So it does seem that the minister is saying that `no detrimental effect' does equal `to the extent reasonably practicable' and that the current situation at Ranger where they cannot yet guarantee no release of radioactive material because they are still experimenting with artificial wetlands to try to leach out radioactivity is acceptable. Given that Senator Parer has specifically promised the Australian mining industry lower environmental compliance costs and in light of the changes made by Senator Parer to the environmental conditions associated with the Jabiluka project, how can the Australian community have any faith in the assurances given by you and your government, Minister, in relation to the protection of Kakadu National Park?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

The honourable senator obviously did not listen to my answer, because I said that we have every reason to be confident that there will be no detrimental environmental effect beyond the mine site. It is on the basis of that confidence&mdash;confidence that we have from all the best engineering and other advice that has come through the EIS&mdash;that it was ultimately approved. So I say to Senator Margetts that she should also have that confidence, because the Howard government is determined to maintain the strongest environmental standards. Mining proposals that go ahead have to get over a very high high&hyphen;jump bar. We do not apologise for that, because basically the mining industry of Australia has changed.

This review will ensure that the reforms are achieving the government's goal of a unified aged care sector&mdash;one of which all Australians can be proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In developing our policies for reform, the previous family services minister listened to what a very wide range of groups had told her was wrong with the system. Thirteen years of your government produced the neglect that we are now aware of. We have listened&mdash;unlike the Labor Party, who did not listen to anything. They did not listen to anything. Who was their Prime Minister? Does anybody remember his name? It was Mr Keating, Captain Wacky. He did not listen to anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have inherited this terrible dilemma. This terrible problem has occurred. To do something about it, we listened to everybody. We listened to everybody who had some suggestions to make. But we will protect people. We will protect people when others try to exploit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly take notice of what Mr Moran says. I have met with Mr Moran. He heads up a very good nursing home. We listen to everybody who has a constructive suggestion in this regard because it is in the interests of the aged population of this country that we do so. We also have a responsibility to the taxpayer to produce an equitable system that respects the dignity of aged people in this country, that recognises the absolute explosion that is occurring with people over the age of 65 who will need to be catered for within the population as the aged care system comes under increasing demand, which it inevitably will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is increasing demand in the aged care system that must be addressed in this country. We are addressing it in an equitable fashion, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7582"> in a fashion with which people will be able to cope, to cope with the numbers that are occurring in the population, which were ignored by the opposition when they were in government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today, relating to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an issue that is creating a great deal of concern and fear within the elderly population of the Australian community. It may well be that this government would like to paint the picture that they have done everything they can to provide a proper nursing home facility for those elderly people, but the situation is very much different.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7583">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election, this government did not add further funding to aged care, did not provide further funding to nursing homes, but, in 1996, took away the sum of $577 million from nursing home care in Australia. That is a pretty poor situation when we had Senator Herron getting up and stating over and over again what a poor situation nursing homes were in and what great need there was to provide further capital in those homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real fear in the community. There is a very real fear by elderly people that, in a situation where they are elderly, frail and in many cases spending the last few months of their lives with intensive medical care in a nursing home, they will not only have to deal with all the problems, the difficulties and the stresses of that change, that very difficult situation, but also have to in many cases sell their sole asset&mdash;that is, their home, which for many people is the only asset they have been able to acquire throughout their lives&mdash;to get into that nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it interesting that, after all the discussion that has occurred and all the evidence that was taken by the community affairs committee, Senator Herron is stating that the average fee payable will be $26,000. I have to say that Senator Herron has a very, very poor memory. I remember when this proposition was first debated in this chamber and the opposition put forward the view that the fees would be about $26,000. We were screamed down by members of the government who said that it was a wild exaggeration and was certainly not what would occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite extraordinary that some time down the track we have Senator Herron coming in here and claiming as a defence that, in fact, the fees will be, on average, $26,000. I do not know how many times we have to go over it, but obviously it has to be many times for the members of this government. Certainly, the average fees that are going to be charged are well in excess of $26,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact we were told by Mr Brotherhood, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals&mdash;a group that I would not say had a particular brief for the opposition&mdash;that they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought that the average entry fee would be $50,000, and that would be for a single room. We also received evidence at that community affairs hearing that some fees would be as high as $90,000 and in some cases even more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures that are being put forward by the opposition are not scare tactics. They are not untrue. They are a proper assessment of the effect of this government's policies on the elderly, the frail aged, who are trying to get into nursing homes&mdash;not because they choose to, not because it is a holiday camp, but because they have to because of their frailty and their state of health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem of course is that as well as this entry fee there are other changes that this government has wrought&mdash;other punishments that this government has inflicted&mdash;on elderly people, because at the same time there is now an additional daily fee payable of up to $37 for those people in nursing homes. I suppose that a lot of people would think that $37 a day was unfair for those frail, sick and elderly people. But the worst thing about this $37 is that, in  fact, it does not provide additional funds so that those elderly people can enjoy a higher quality of care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot believe that this is on the agenda again. It seems to be the same thing that keeps coming up time and time and time again. The opposition keeps on lying about what is happening in terms of aged care. Today, it has gone one step further: to try to imply that the prudential arrangements are somehow not going to work satisfactorily for both the occupants of nursing homes and those running the nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to recap one thing that I have recapped every time the opposition have had the gall to bring this subject up. It needs to be emphasised because no matter how many times it is mentioned you cannot get it through their thick skulls. It is that when the opposition were in government they ran down the expenditure on nursing homes. They ran down the amount that was put into nursing homes and aged care by 75 per cent. In 1992&hyphen;93 a total of $45 million was spent on capital 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7584"> stock, but by 1993&hyphen;94 it had declined to $26.5 million. By 1995&hyphen;96 it was down to $10.7 million. That is a decline of 70 per cent in funding. It is absolutely and utterly appalling in terms of what is going on in the debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate today bears absolutely no relevance to reality and I want to come to the main features of the prudential arrangements because I think part of the biggest problem that the opposition has now created, other than fear among the aged, is this fear among the beneficiaries of the aged who somehow see their entitlement to their inheritance being whittled away. The opposition clearly does not tell the truth on the way in which the prudential arrangements are going to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key features of the prudential arrangements are as follows: an industry wide fund at arm's length from government will be established as a trustee regulated fund with participating providers registering and maintaining an account; the full amount of all lump sum accommodation will be paid into and held by the trust for the duration of a resident's stay in any facility; and the size and strength of the trust will allow it to support borrowing by facilities in combination with the income stream from retention and interest which will flow to them. Each resident who pays a bond will receive a certificate from the guarantee fund acknowledging its receipt and undertaking to repay within the prescribed period if the resident leaves the facility at any time. The guarantee fund will be responsible for repaying bonds owing to residents who leave a facility. This is the part that the opposition are misrepresenting time and time and time again. They are saying that money will go in, never to be seen again. They know that to be wrong. They know that to be totally and utterly untruthful, but it does not stop them repeating it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Providers will be entitled to draw down from the guarantee fund the monthly retention amount which equals, in a per annum rate, up to $2,600 for five years and they will receive interest on bonds held in the fund, net of all scheme administration costs. All the funds are taking out is $2,600 per year as a maximum 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount. That is not what the opposition is saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before making a decision to enter a facility, prospective residents and their families will be able to seek information from the fund on the compliance of individual providers with the prudential requirements. Bonds on deposit with the guarantee fund will be invested in accordance with agreed guidelines which will ensure fund liquidity and a matching of bonds with secure assets. Bonds paid as periodic amounts will not be covered by the scheme as there is no refundable component and entry contributions received by hostels before 1 October will also not be covered. Hostels for which the requirement to deposit all new bonds in the guarantee fund would cause cash flow difficulties will be assisted by transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing I want not only to make clear on the record but also to restate the case that that is the policy for hostels that the Labor opposition put in place when they were in government. Why do they now misrepresent it so badly in opposition?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles has once again reiterated this line that what this government is doing is merely an extension of what the Labor government did with respect to hostels. That is a lie that is being perpetrated time and time again by spokespersons for this government. So that it is clear to Senator Knowles and clear to Senator Herron, the absent minister representing the Minister for Family Services, who floundered around through question time today and never once addressed the problems in this sector: there is a major difference between hostel accommodation and nursing home accommodation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference is that people choose to go into hostel accommodation. If they feel that they have reached a point in their life where whilst they are still able to care for themselves they would rather do it in hostel accommodation where services are provided they can choose to do that. It is a lifestyle choice for elderly people&mdash;just as they could choose to stay at home and have a member of the family look after them or stay at home and maybe have the home care service, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7585"> domiciliary nursing and so on come in and assist them&mdash;to go into a hostel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a lifestyle choice when people enter nursing homes. They go into nursing homes because they are no longer capable of caring for themselves adequately and in many cases their family members are no longer capable of carrying on that task no matter how committed they are to that. It is an absolute distortion of the truth for this government to stand up and say that imposing bonds, which may amount to $100,000 or more, on people to get a bed in a nursing home is somehow simply an extension of what occurs for hostels. The fundamental reason our government did not implement this system for nursing homes was that nursing home care is essentially acute care which is not provided in a hospital. It is provided in a nursing home facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to run this line then you may as well say that if you are going to have bonds for hostels and bonds for nursing homes then you may as well have bonds for people who may end up in public hospitals because they cannot get a bed in a nursing home. Let us put a stop to all of this lying that is going on about this being an extension of what happens in hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not scaremongering by the opposition. Everybody in this country knows that when the government introduced this system on 1 October we warned it would create chaos, confusion, uncertainty and anxiety. That is precisely what has occurred. Every day now you pick up a newspaper and read stories about elderly people and their families who are having difficulty understanding this system and who are being told they have to sell their homes to get a bed in a nursing home. If you pick up today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> you can read an article by Francis Sullivan, the Executive Director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government should acknowledge its diminishing commitment to the elderly. Rather than bemoaning the parlous state of some aged care facilities and reducing funding of the sector at the same time, Mr Smith should rethink his approach to a sustainable and fair aged care service. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Francis Sullivan heads up the organisation that in the end accepted this government's proposed aged care system but recognised all along that there were inherent problems in it&mdash;problems associated with the bonds and problems associated with the significant increases in daily fees. It was the opposition that constantly said that this legislation should not have been introduced on 1 October. In fact, it should not have been introduced at all. The whole scheme should be scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government are finally going to listen to what people out there are saying then the best thing they could do for the elderly in the community is suspend this scheme, go back to the drawing board and fix it up. It is full of problems and it is causing mass confusion and anxiety out there in the community. Do not go around trying to suggest that it is some sort of Labor Party scare tactic. It is a fact that you are destroying the aged care sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to say that it is a Labor Party scare tactic. This is a fairly simple and straightforward scheme and most of the concern which exists out there in the community relates to the fact that the opposition is going around scaremongering and putting fear into the hearts of elderly people about whether or not they will have adequate care in a nursing home under these new arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that their care in a nursing home is not under threat at all. Furthermore, under the government's proposal, the standard of care they will receive in nursing homes will increasingly be better. The truth of the matter is that Australian nursing homes are in a very bad state and the ALP knows that. In the past hostels were in a bad state. Ten years ago, when the ALP were in government, they introduced a scheme very similar to this where people paid up-front accommodation bonds to enter hostels. As a result, over the last 10 years the standard of hostel accommodation&mdash;that is, the stage before nursing homes&mdash;in this country has increased dramatically. Hostels are now very clean, nice, pleasant places for people to live.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7586">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes, by contrast, are of very poor quality on average. For example, 40 per cent of nursing home residents share their bedroom with four or more people. If anybody in the Senate has ever been into a nursing home&mdash;and I have been into a lot of them&mdash;you would have found the beds crammed together often with less than a metre between them. Thirteen per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire regulations. That is a frightening thing. Eleven per cent of nursing homes do not meet basic health regulations. I think that is appalling. The government thinks it is appalling as well and that is why this plan has been introduced. The major purpose of the accommodation bond is to improve the standard of nursing homes. Unless nursing homes meet basic minimum standards they will lose their accreditation and they will not be able to carry on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about the fact that people may have to sell their homes to raise the bond to go into nursing homes, but of course that is not true. It is only after six months that the issue of a bond arises at all. As has been said before in the Senate, some 43 per cent of people who enter nursing homes do not survive six months. So, in fact, the question of a bond only arises for the residual 57 per cent. They do not have to sell their homes if they have a dependent relative at home&mdash;that is, a partner or a child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the remaining people, it is true that in the assessment of their assets for a bond their home is taken into consideration. If their home is sold, the money goes into a trust, as has been said. As Senator Knowles explained, only $2,600 per year can be drawn down from that trust over a maximum period of five years, which adds up to $13,000 over that five&hyphen;year period. The rest of the money is kept in the trust. The nursing home uses the funds to improve the quality of the accommodation and when a person dies, as Senator Herron alluded to in his answer today&mdash;and most people survive for only three to four years in a nursing home&mdash;the funds are returned to the estate and the relatives benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it incredible that Senator Knowles rose to her feet here today to say in an exasperated manner that we had the audacity to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate once again. If this is such a non-issue then why is it constantly in the media? Why is it constantly in the newspapers and on television? This whole issue is such an important issue to not only the elderly people of Australia but also their children and grandchildren. People out there are scared. We are not the ones who are launching a scaremongering tactic; this government has scared elderly people. Elderly people are absolutely terrified of what is going to happen to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron waffled on in question time today and he would not answer my questions. When I asked about the up-front entry fee being as high as $100,000, he denied this and said that the fees would not be that high. But there is no ceiling on the entry fee, no ceiling whatsoever. People who have assets worth more than $22,500 are the ones who must pay this entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of $22,500 worth of assets is an extraordinarily piddling amount of assets. Most people have a home and the average, ordinary worker's home these days is valued between $100,000 and $150,000. That is quite in excess of $22,500. So of course all of these people will have to pay the entry fee. To be left with $22,500 they will be paying enormous entry fees into nursing homes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7587">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that people can go into hostels, and hostels have been charging bonds. But you choose to go into a hostel. If you go into a nursing home it is because you need acute care. You usually go into a nursing home at a time when you are extremely sick and the family is distressed. A lot of people at that stage cannot make decisions for themselves and the family has to make the decision. If these people do not have a family and they are on their own then they are even more distressed, and who is going to make these decisions for them? They are going to be whacked into a nursing home and their homes will be sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often the case, particularly with older people on their own, that once older people lose their home, once they have nowhere to go back to, even if their illness has improved, they have no security. I have seen so many cases where this has happened, particularly to older women who have survived their husbands. They go into these places and if their health improves they have nowhere to go. Their security is gone&mdash;everything. They lose everything because if an older person does not have their home they have nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron did not know the answers to any questions today, and the advice of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to people to rent their home instead of selling it is absolutely ludicrous. How can the average home bring in a rental of $450 a week? That is what the new Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) said people would have to earn to pay for most of the accommodation. Maybe in Sydney you can rent a home for that&mdash;I do not know about rentals in Sydney. But to bring in a rental of $450 a week in Brisbane you would have to have a mansion. So the whole thing is absolutely ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this government to say that we are scaremongering is absolutely atrocious because they are the ones who are denying elderly Australians who have paid taxes all their lives, who have gone to war for this country, who have lived and survived through depression and brought up their families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP reduced capital funding to nursing homes by 75 per cent between 1992-1993 and 1995-1996. It is worth having that figure on the record again. The ALP cut funding by 75 per cent, and you have the audacity to come in here and ask, `Who cares?' You deliberately ran down the nursing home sector. In 1985, Bob Gregory warned you, the then government, that $125 million per year was needed to upgrade nursing homes. Your response&mdash;zilch. At the last election, the ALP's policy on aged care ran to 200 words&mdash;half a page. This is how much the ALP, the then government, cared about the older people in our community. You should be ashamed of yourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government, we found nursing homes that do not meet fire standards. Some 11 per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire standards, and 15 per cent do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7588"> meet state health standards. In 40 per cent of nursing homes, patients share a room with four or more. The ALP's record is appalling, but it is typical of those who sit on the other side and cloak their words with compassion and integrity but do nothing. The Australian public knows that to be a compassionate government you must at times take tough decisions&mdash;tough decisions that will see the sector strong into the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will cite a couple of facts that are often neglected in discussion of this issue. Under our reforms, 27 per cent of nursing home beds will be guaranteed for the financially disadvantaged. The number of people over 65 will grow by 48 per cent over the next 20 years. We just cannot afford to turn our backs on the perilous condition of nursing homes in this country. This year we will spend $3.7 billion on aged care, on supporting our older people, and this does not include their pensions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment Bill will extend the operation of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, and consequently the Commonwealth Road Transport Reform Legislation, for twelve months beyond the sunset date of 14 January 1998, providing for the continuation of the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) for that time. The proposal also allows the current Commissioners to be reappointed, and ensures that a review will not have to be undertaken within this twelve month extension .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension will allow time for a substantial Bill and supporting inter-government agreements, implementing the results of the Review of National Road Transport Legislation, to be settled between all Heads of Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reasons for Urgency</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing NRTC Act ceases on 14 January 1998. Unless an amendment is made to the Act, the NRTC will cease to exist along with the Road Transport Legislation it has produced: the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic Act) 1993, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7593"> the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995, and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed substantial legislation implementing the results of the Review is a government priority. However, consultation on its form with the States and Territories has been protracted, and although most issues have been satisfactorily settled, Heads of Government have now been asked for their final agreement on all issues. Thus it has not proved feasible to introduce the amendment Bill in time to allow for it to be passed in the Spring sittings, even though a draft Bill has been prepared. It is expected that the substantial Bill will be brought forward as soon as Heads of Government agree to it, for passage prior to the end of the extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction and passage of the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill in the 1997 Spring sitting is essential to allow for the legislation to be extended before the critical sunset date.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, I seek leave to report to the House on the 28th South Pacific Forum, held in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands, from 17 to 19 September 1997. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual South Pacific Forum brings together the leaders of the region's island countries, Australia and New Zealand. It is a good opportunity for informal and frank discussions which are valuable in maintaining a strong sense of community and common interests in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's membership of the Forum is an expression of commitment to our partnership with the countries of the region. Australia is part of the region&mdash;not just because geography makes us neighbours, but also because we have shared interests in the region's stability and well&hyphen;being of its people. There are close links between Australians and the people of the South Pacific, through business, tourism in both directions, family ties and the many thousands of island people who have been educated in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia recognises that there are harsher dimensions to life in the South Pacific than the idyllic beaches and clear water that tourists enjoy in the island paradises. The other realities for island countries are their isolation, smallness, dependence on the ocean and vulnerability to nature. Australia has always been there to help in times of difficulty, as we are now for example in helping Papua New Guinea cope with severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My government is committed to strengthening that partnership. We have maintained aid levels to the Pacific, despite cuts in the overall aid budget. About 40 per cent of our total bilateral aid goes to the South Pacific. We are committed to helping island countries achieve their goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our strong partnership with the countries of the region does not mean we will not sometimes have differences of approach and perspective. But we have common interests in working them through and reaching, if not full agreement, then at least understanding of each other's position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant outcome of this year's Forum was leaders' endorsement of the Action Plan for economic reform drawn up by Forum economic ministers in their meeting in Cairns in July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the regional countries&mdash;including the Forum's host country, the Cook Islands&mdash;have made good progress in reforming their economies over the past few years. The Action Plan provides a sound and flexible framework for promoting economic development and will help the region respond to the challenges of a fast&hyphen;changing world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Action Plan requires countries to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> develop comprehensive economic reform strategies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> invite the private sector to recommend to governments measures to improve competitiveness</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopt a set of best&hyphen;practice principles for public accountability and transparency of government finances and economic management 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7598">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> pursue open investment policies consistent with APEC principles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> work towards a common goal of open and free trade, with each country deciding its own timetable</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rationalise and progressively reduce tariffs, while recognising the special circumstances of some smaller island economies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been an active supporter of economic reform and sustainable development of the region's resources. We think the future stability and viability of the region's countries depends on them taking the necessary action now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has not foisted these reforms on the region. The island countries themselves have control of the scope and pace of reform. They will make their own decisions, taking into account their own circumstances and the nature of their societies and cultures. Australia is investing considerable resources in aid programmes to back up their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second significant outcome from the Forum was the leaders' retreat statement on climate change. My objective in discussions on this topic was to promote and protect Australia's national interest. Some opposite have criticised me for this. I am not going to be apologetic about standing up for my country's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's negotiating position at the forthcoming climate change meeting at Kyoto has been fully protected. This was my responsibility as Australia's leader at the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome was therefore good for Australia. But it was also good for the other participants. It was a fair outcome that reflected a consensus of views, not one on which particular views were subjugated to others. Despite the claims of some, no threats regarding aid were made or even hinted at.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the statement emphasises, all Forum members share concerns about the impact of climate change. A visit to the region makes one conscious of the sense of vulnerability that the very small island states feel to the potential impact of climate change and rising sea levels. It is not, however, just the small island states who face problems. Changing weather patterns would affect us all, including Australia with our long coastline and vast rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia shares with the island countries a strong common interest in an effective international regime for a net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's position is that any regime will be effective only if it is realistic and fair&mdash;and therefore has a reasonable chance of being implemented. There is no gain for the environment from an agreement which is not worth the paper it's written 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on because the commitments are not credible and the burden of efforts and cost is not equitably distributed. The bottom line is that an unrealistic and unfair agreement will not work. That is not in the interests of the island countries any more than it is in Australia's.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We firmly believe that any agreement has to provide the basis for involving the developing countries. Everyone who contributes to the problem has to contribute to the solution&mdash;and developing countries will account for nearly half of global emissions by 2010, compared with less than a third today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve a realistic, fair and environmentally effective agreement, Australia is arguing for different targets for different countries, taking into account each country's circumstances. That is what the Europeans have arranged for themselves in their `bubble'&mdash;we are asking only that the same principle be applied to the other countries, including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are prepared to play our part in addressing this global problem. We are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, including through the Greenhouse Challenge programme. We are also providing climate&hyphen;change related support through our aid programme&mdash;with projects worth $45 million in the South Pacific. But we will not accept the economic burden of targets which mean Australia is required to shoulder a disproportionate part of the effort&mdash;and that Australians pay a greater cost than others for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uniform reduction targets being called for&mdash;15 per cent from 1990 levels by 2010 in the case of the Europeans, and 20 per cent by 2005 from the Alliance of Small Island States&mdash;would have a dramatic impact on the Australian economy and people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be penalised for being an efficient producer of energy and emission&hyphen;intensive goods&mdash;most of which we export to other countries that need the products for their economic growth. The impact on our energy intensive and resource processing industries would devastate parts of regional Australia. The job losses and dislocation of peoples' lives would be immense, including in the Illawarra and the Hunter valley in New South Wales, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana and north west regions of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New investment in energy intensive industry would be threatened, risking the potential in some estimates for up to 90,000 new long&hyphen;term jobs. According to ABARE, if Australia returned to 1990 levels of greenhouse emissions by 2010, it could involve an increase in petrol prices of up to 70 cents a litre, a similar increase in diesel prices, an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7599"> increase in natural gas prices of up to 40 cents a litre and an increase in average electricity prices of up to 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what would this destructive result for Australia achieve for the environment? The answer is: very little. Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of global emissions. Even if we closed down every emissions&hyphen;producing industry, it would have virtually no impact on global emissions growth. Many emissions&hyphen;producing industries would simply move off&hyphen;shore. Australia's role as an efficient supplier of energy would be taken by others whose controls and technology are not as good as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our differentiation approach would also provide a fair basis for the future involvement of developing countries. The only way to bring them on board is to identify different targets, taking account of their different stages of development and their capacity to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was an important element in the Forum statement on climate change. The need to involve developing countries was recognised by all Forum leaders. The Forum statement's call for the Kyoto outcome to provide procedures and time frames for drawing in significant developing country emitters in the future is a major step forward in the negotiations leading up to Kyoto. It is the first time that developed and developing countries have joined forces in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another issue of significance to the region's environment, I announced at the Forum that Australia is prepared to make a significant contribution to the building in Samoa of a new headquarters for the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the design for which we have already funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SPREP has an important role to play on a wide range of regional environmental issues and Forum leaders are in agreement that it needs new headquarters to carry out its tasks effectively. We will also talk to the government of Japan about joining us and New Zealand&mdash;and other Forum countries which may wish to contribute&mdash;in putting together the necessary funds to ensure that the new headquarters are built as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also discussed at the Forum the main challenges to the security of regional countries&mdash;especially their vulnerability to increasing trans-national criminal activity, including drug-trafficking. The outcome of our discussions was the `Aitutaki Declaration on Regional Security Cooperation' which provides for the enhancement of existing consultation and coordination arrangements to respond to these challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is already working constructively with regional countries to address these issues. In regard to the particular threat posed by drug&hyphen;trafficking, I hope that some of the work being done by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recently established Drugs Task Force will be relevant to the needs of the island countries&mdash;we would be happy to share the results of that work with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For almost a decade now the conflict in Bougainville has been a major security concern in the region. Forum leaders therefore warmly welcomed the recent progress made in restoring peace to Bougainville and noted the appreciation of the PNG government for the assistance of Australia and New Zealand which is hosting peace talks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my discussions at the Forum with the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Skate, I was greatly impressed by his determination to achieve a peaceful settlement of this long-running and debilitating conflict. I assured Mr Skate of Australia's readiness to support his government's efforts and facilitate the peace process. At Mr Skate's request, we have transported PNG government and Bougainvillean participants to the second round of talks in New Zealand. We hope that the outcome of the talks is another step towards peace for the people of Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Forum also expressed its support for the readmission of Fiji to the Commonwealth following the recent successful conclusion of its constitutional review. In my meeting with Fiji's prime minister, Mr Rabuka, I congratulated him on his leadership in achieving an outcome acceptable to all Fiji's communities. The news earlier this week of Fiji's readmission to the Commonwealth is very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the common interests which draws together the people of the Forum member countries is sport. Australians' love of sport, as both participants and spectators, is matched by the enthusiasm of the people of the island countries. The value attached to it is expressed in the declaration on sport and development adopted by the Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased to announce in Rarotonga that Australia will underwrite the journey of the Olympic torch, on its way to Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, through all those Pacific countries which are members of the Olympic movement. This will complement the work Australia is already doing under its South Pacific 2000 programme to assist the development of the region's sportspeople and maximise their participation in the Olympic and Paralympic games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has made every effort to include Australia's South Pacific neighbours in Sydney's hosting of the Olympics. The torch's journey through the region will provide an excellent opportunity for the island countries to take advantage of being in the world spotlight and boost their tourist flows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Forum also commended to its members Canada's candidature for the UN Security Council 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7600"> and appointed Mr Noel Levi, the former head of Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister's Department, as the next secretary&hyphen;general of the Forum's Secretariat. The Australian Government wishes Mr Levi every success in his new position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he needs to take an extra day, then he ought to do so and visit Kuala Lumpur on his way back to meet with Prime Minister Mahathir. Last week there was an announcement in Malaysia that the Transfield bid for the patrol boat contract was lost and there were reflections as to the cause of this. I think all those reflections are essentially idle, but the Prime Minister, at a prime minister&hyphen;to&hyphen;prime minister diplomacy level, should certainly exercise the option of giving respect to the invitation from Malaysia and meet with Prime Minister Mahathir. I say that because I do not want any criticism levelled at the opposition that we do not think the Prime Minister has an important international role. We do think that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the globalised economy, it is very important that the Prime Minister, on behalf of this nation, exercises what commercial leverage he possibly can for the advantage of Australian companies to win key contracts overseas and for us to sell Australian built goods and services in foreign markets. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statement, however, relates to his visit to the South Pacific on 17 to 19 September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was asked recently: why is it, when Australia must survive in an increasingly competitive international marketplace, that we do not have an internationally competitive Prime Minister? I think that is a fair question. We have a Prime Minister who falls well short of what one would expect in the tough bargaining of that international marketplace. I do not think it is possible to improve on the newspaper headline dealing with the trip to the South Pacific which said `Travelling PM on the last train to Klutzville'. That was the headline he got out of his famous cricketing trip to Britain in which he enjoyed afternoon tea with the Queen and morning tea with former Prime Minister Thatcher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was in the South Pacific the Prime Minister was hardly able to be soothed over the leaking in July of the infamous FEMM report&mdash;a report which contained extremely condescending and offensive comments about South Pacific leaders. We only need to cast our minds back to the leaking of what was quite sensitive intelligence documents from within Australia to understand why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among some of the choice excerpts contained in that infamous leaked document was one which described a minister for foreign affairs of a neighbouring nation as a `compromised lame duck'. There was another which described an island state, one of our near neighbours, as having `ingrained bad habits'. The deputy prime minister of another of our neighbouring countries in the South Pacific was described as `an old radical on the make' and the prime minister of another of our Pacific neighbours was described in this report as `boastful and vain' and `drinking heavily'. The deputy prime minister of a principal neighbour of Australia was described in the report as `ever an opportunist' and as `a Methodist by upbringing who does not practise and enjoys late hours in nightclubs'. To complete the list, a deputy prime minister of another of our Pacific island nation neighbours was dismissed, in the terms of this report, as a `lickspittle'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of incompetence&mdash;the leaking of this document&mdash;was blamed on junior offi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7601"> cials with no questions asked about the ministers to whom those officials report and who allowed the report to be circulated in the first place. This was a question of blaming the staff rather than accepting responsibility at ministerial level. If this was to be dismissed as the condescending attitude of faceless bureaucrats, it was just a foretaste of the condescending attitude of the Prime Minister when he got to the South Pacific on this trip in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main feature of this prime ministerial visit to the South Pacific Forum was, of course, debate about the greenhouse effect on the South Pacific island nations, the island states of that region of the world. The Prime Minister waded into the South Pacific, I have to say, as an ugly Australian&mdash;bullying and insensitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a legitimate position on the greenhouse issue to argue in international forums. It is appropriate that Australia be given some separate differential recognition for the huge contribution that we make through our use of fossil fuels. It is proper that Australia continue to make the point about a particular responsibility of developing countries to contribute to the greenhouse emissions problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do not advance that cause by not arguing with any degree of competence or sophistication for specific targets that would be appropriate for us as compared to the rest of the world. And we do not advance that cause by stomping on the heads of our Pacific island neighbours and generally behaving like the ugly Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister used the $450 million Australian aid package to the South Pacific to bully the South Pacific nations into a Pyrrhic victory for Australia. The Prime Minister of Tuvalu, characterising the dilemma he was placed in by Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a very important partner and we respect them . . . But being small, we depend on them so much we had to give in . . . there was no compromise. It was just `No, no, no, no, no'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister had to play the spoiling game, because we have no alibi on greenhouse gas emissions any more. Prior to this government gutting them, we had real strat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> egies. We had good research on alternative energy sources and good research on how you become more greenhouse gas efficient. This is gone; all we have is the big stick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international consensus on greenhouse is moving towards mandatory targets. It is a critical moment for Australia. We cannot afford to be a rogue and stand outside an international consensus. Now is the moment of decision, and we should have been in a position to say, `These are the differential targets that are fair and just to Australia. You should take account of the fact that we save other people enormous amounts of emissions by producing alumina, for example, here in Australia and we ought to be allowed a differential regime and the regime should look like this.' Instead, Australia's reputation in the Pacific is damaged in the same way it is damaged around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a nation that once stood proud and tall in this region around us. We had a government that was respectable and respected. Now we look like a bunch of amateurs. We send the village idiot in the form of the foreign minister all around the world to embarrass us and, when countries finally get a look at the Prime Minister, what do they get?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also now have an example of where the Prime Minister has not accepted an invitation to Malaysia, which, many think, has commercially hurt Australia. The coverage emerging from the South Pacific summit has been no kinder. Geoffrey Barker has provided some flavour of the trip which is becoming painfully familiar to those who follow press coverage of John Howard overseas. I quote from what Geoffrey Barker said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7602">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At social and group functions involving the leaders, he [Howard] sometimes seemed churlish . . . Howard appeared to prefer the company of his own staff and officials when attending public functions with other leaders, and seemed a diminished figure as [NZ Prime Minister Jim] Bolger assumed the role of the Big Man and peacemaker.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then we had the much publicised side-trip to Tahiti to find accommodation better befitting the entourage, adding an additional $60,000 to the total trip costs overall. This occurred just the week before the government ran into its own problems on travel costs and in the context of constant carping about social security fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another trip that the Prime Minister should make and make quickly&mdash;a trip to honour the retiring President of the Philippines, Fidel Ramos, when he steps down early next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We at last have an opportunity in this place, a month after this visit occurred, to look at and discuss the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to look at what actually happened during his visit, which I would categorise as perhaps one of the most unsuccessful visits that a Prime Minister of this country has ever been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many words have been used in the press to describe the impression that his foray into the South Pacific has left with us. From memory, words like `embarrassing', `inept', `bullying' and `ham&hyphen;fisted' were used. In terms of coverage, I think it was some of the most negative reporting that any Prime Minister has had to face back here in Australia after a visit. Indeed, if you pulled out a thesaurus and looked up the word `fiasco', I think you would come pretty close to summing up the occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the entire exercise was not only an embarrassment but that it lacked the sort of diplomacy that one would have expected from a leader&mdash;in particular, from a leader at an international conference. I wonder what type of instructions are being given to those who are going to Kyoto. Will we see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another bullying performance like the one in the South Pacific?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should have recognised quite some months ago that Australia's standing in the South Pacific was considerably damaged by the leaking of the Treasury's so-called intelligence document&mdash;a document that should never have existed, let alone have been circulated and left in a place that meant it could be publicised. But how do you maintain harmonious relations with your neighbours&mdash;I will not do all of this; it has been done by the previous speaker, Senator Cook&mdash;after calling partners `lickspittle', which is one of the memories I have of that document?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the South Pacific Forum, where things did not exactly get off to a good start. I begin by quoting the Prime Minister's words from a press conference of 17 September when Mr Howard told journalists:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nonetheless quite a bit of debate about the science, so far as greenhouse effects are concerned, and it's not all one way. It is not all&mdash;how should one put it&mdash;the apocalyptic view of the world and of life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have a Prime Minister, our nation's chief, on his very first day at an international forum, disputing solid science and putting himself at odds with every other leader of every other developed country in the world. He put himself at odds not only with them but also with his colleague Senator Hill, who in this place has acknowledged that we do have something in front of us that is of major significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It only got worse as the conference went on. Mr Howard could, I think, have been best described as `The Solitary Man' as he went into intimidation mode. He told the people in the countries perhaps most at threat&mdash;the South Pacific is, indeed, at the cutting edge of the greenhouse effect&mdash;`Sorry, you have to play it Australia's way or else.' We do not know exactly what his words were, but we suspect his pressure had something to do with Australia's aid or trade. He ignored the island nations' greenhouse concerns, their genuine concerns for their survival, and peddled out, yet again, his flawed figures from that famous ABARE model&mdash;the model that was paid for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7603"> by those who are most interested in Australia and, indeed, the world doing nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our coal industry will be just as hard&hyphen;hit by the changes if the world signs up. Regardless of what Australia does, the coal industry will still be hard&hyphen;hit if the amount of coal the world is using is reduced. If Australia sits on its hands and says, `Sorry, we're not playing. We're not doing anything,' our coal industry will need to look seriously at restructuring. As some of our oil producing companies have done, it will have to look at divesting, reinvesting and changing direction. It will have to look at alternative energy sources. But none of these issues were raised. Mr Howard just came back with the ABARE model. Basically, he followed Brian Fisher's line. Mr Fisher has been quoted as saying that it would be better if we let the island nations sink and relocated their populations as refugees rather than Australia getting involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the Prime Minister's statement&mdash;this catalogue I would describe as absolute nonsense&mdash;we finally got to look at officially today. No wonder it has taken so long for us to get it. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a shared interest in the region's stability and wellbeing of its people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Shared interest? There is absolutely no interest in these nations' most critical issue&mdash;the one they raised with our Prime Minister&mdash;no interest at all. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has always been there to help in times of difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Aren't the threats that they are facing from increased and more regular storms, increased storm surges and urban flooding difficulties? Aren't they facing times of difficulty? While they are facing times of difficulty we want to increase our greenhouse gas emissions! Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A visit to the region makes one conscious of the sense of vulnerability that the very small island states feel to the potential impact of climate change and rising sea levels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously Mr Howard is aware of the problem. Why doesn't his government give a damn about it? Why was he prepared to go to the forum and use bullyboy tactics to stop any consensus&mdash;indeed, any decision or statement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at all&mdash;that had greenhouse gas emissions as part of it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the nonsense from ABARE. The modelling assumes there are no technological changes that can be put in place to encourage energy efficiency; that there can be no switching to renewable energy sources and that there can be no growth in employment in the sustainable energy industry. ABARE leaves all that out of the model very conveniently. The ABARE model assumes that carbon emissions can be cut solely by the blunt instrument of a massive carbon tax with no other tax changes. The massive amount of money which will be raised will simply be put into someone's back pocket or a black hole somewhere, and that will be the end of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, ABARE goes so far as to claim that a carbon tax of $900 per tonne of carbon would be needed to take us down below the 1990 levels. No&hyphen;one else in the world is using figures even vaguely like these. They are so unreasonable that we will be a laughing&hyphen;stock if we go over to Kyoto and trot them out yet again. Mr Howard enthused about the Sydney 2000 Olympics. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased to announce Australia will underwrite the journey of the Olympic torch through all those Pacific countries which are members of the Olympic movement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All I could think of while I was reading that statement was the torch slowly glugging its way across the Pacific and not burning very brightly once it got to Australia. As I read this report of the visit all I can think of is that Australia can best be categorised as the neighbour from hell. I offer this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a lot of anger in the Australian community, right across the political spectrum, of this extremely self&hyphen;interested, selfish act which is a blatant indifference to the concerns of people who live in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where did these words come from? These are the words of John Howard, then in opposition, condemning nuclear testing in the Pacific. Somebody should tell Mr Howard that there is a lot of anger in the Australian community and, indeed, amongst the nations of the South Pacific over his totally irresponsible, flawed and dangerous greenhouse gas position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will we go to Kyoto with the research we are using presently and try to hang onto the claim that for some reason we need to be treated as a special case? Will we ignore the fact that the 1990 figure we will be asked to get back to, or even five or 10 per cent below, is also very bad on the world scale? Back in 1990 we were one of the worst polluters. It is not as if we will suddenly be asked to reduce to the emission levels of Luxembourg or Japan; we are being asked to go back to what was already quite a poor position. But we do not hear any of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go to Kyoto ignoring all the new jobs that are waiting to be created, waiting to be done&mdash;whether it is insulating homes or whether it is research into new technology&mdash;we really will be a laughing&hyphen;stock. If we expect differentiation we could end up with a tougher target than everybody else. If we keep pushing the line that some nations are special cases and that all should be considered on their merits, Australia could very well end up in a lot tougher position and have a lot tougher target to meet than any other country. I condemn the Howard government's arrogant and irresponsible approach to climate change negotiations, and I condemn its indifference to our South Pacific neighbours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is most remarkable for what it does not contain&mdash;that is, an analysis of his shortcomings in the interests of Australia when he went to the South Pacific Forum. He let down our Pacific neighbours, as earlier speakers have outlined, and he let down this nation at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the Prime Minister let down future generations of Australians because, when we are talking about global warming, we are not talking about ourselves. We are talking in the main about the interests of the next half dozen generations of people on this planet, and that includes every Australian born in this country now or in centuries to come in the succeeding generations. They are being affected by our decisions on whether to curtail or at least curb greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some debate about whether Australians per head of population are the worst polluters of greenhouse gases on the planet. Certainly, we are amongst the worst three polluting countries on the planet. So we have a very real domestic need to head the world innovation and turn around this phenomenon. But instead of that, we have a government, and in particular a Prime Minister, which is unable to take the wise counsel of the now thousands of the world's most eminent scientists and has instead opted for the counsel of a very constricted section of the business community&mdash;in particular, the coal and aluminium industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument those industries have put is that it will affect investment and in particular jobs in Australia. The argument they cannot refute is that not getting into energy alternatives&mdash;in particular, sun based alternatives for the future&mdash;is losing far more jobs out of Australia to other more innovative countries and is losing more investment than their investments will ever account for. So the first thing that needs to be said is that we need to be an innovative, far&hyphen;thinking society instead of a society&mdash;as represented by our Prime Minister and the industries he is taking heed of&mdash;that is blinkered, small&hyphen;minded and cuts the ground from under future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister went to the South Pacific, he diminished this country almost every day of his stay. The nadir of his visit was when he indicated to the South Pacific nations that, in effect, they could sink before he would cut across the interests of the coal and aluminium industries in this country. They could go under; it was thumbs down to those tiny nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that the way you treat your nearest&mdash;your neighbours&mdash;ultimately says how you will treat yourself in the long run. On this occasion, we had a Prime Minister and a delegation to the South Pacific that came nowhere near the mark. It was an embarrassment. It was a denouement for Australian diplomacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is notable that, at about the same time, New Zealand was taking the lead in negotiations for a settlement in Bougainville&mdash;a major and prolonged dispute in our neigh 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7605"> bourhood that Australia should have been acting on in a more equitable fashion long ago. Japan has also taken the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of this disastrous visit to the South Pacific by John Howard representing Australia, Japan has had the welcome mat out to the same nations at a particularly accommodating meeting in Japan. Who can blame the South Pacific nations if they think New Zealand and Japan are acting in their interests? They would just have to think of the selfishness displayed by Prime Minister Howard during his visit to the South Pacific Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a notable shortcoming of this Prime Minister that he cannot understand the long term. It is a notable shortcoming that he is unable to relate to the plight of other people. When he is unable to relate to the plight of people in the South Pacific nations&mdash;who are faced with the end of their nations as they know them as a result of global warming&mdash;you have to fear for his ability to relate to the Australian people themselves. That is a matter coming under increasing question. That is a matter that is going to come under very harsh judgment in the coming 18 months or so in the run to the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say&mdash;and I know many Green voters felt this way&mdash;that it was a matter of acute embarrassment to have Prime Minister Howard failing to relate to our long-term neighbours, our long-term friends and the long&hyphen;term interests of our friends in the South Pacific. It was a very sad period in Australian diplomacy, and one cannot expect that pattern is going to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must add that, from a very small position in this Senate, I have been able to bring forward from the Greens one positive alternative to the polluting fossil fuel industry of the past&mdash;that is, the  Sun Fund Bill 1997 , which is before the Senate now. It has been before a committee and we await its report. If, from the meagre resources of the Greens, we can come forward with a positive and attractive idea like that&mdash;to not only stimulate alternative energy but to stimulate thousands of jobs in this country through a small change in the way the government allocates finances for the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had very well thought out submissions from Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Democrats, the Greens and a very impressive array of scientists in this country and internationally. The problem is the mind-set of the Prime Minister, his advisers, his colleagues and his cabinet. The government is not open. It is not accommodating to new ideas. Sadly, it is not even accommodating to the exigencies of nations which fear for their very existence because of the failure of countries like Australia to be good international citizens and, in particular, to be citizens who have their mind on the interests of future generations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have great pleasure today in tabling two reports by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Both of these reports are the result of seminars held 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the joint standing committee on these specific topics over the winter period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminars are a very useful way to look at a foreign policy or defence issue in a timely fashion. While it certainly does not permit the same level of detailed scrutiny as a full inquiry, the seminar process does allow the committee to gather together a diverse range of individuals and groups to discuss a particular issue. The dialogue between all of the participants is extremely constructive, and one of the major benefits at each of the seminars was the interchange of ideas between people from quite different backgrounds and points of view. The committee has held a number of these seminars since July 1996, and we have had very considerable positive feedback on the format and the processes they follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the government officials, members of the diplomatic corps, business representatives, academics, members of the NGO community, members of parliament and members of the general community who attended these seminars and contributed so much to their success. My thanks go also to those members of the joint standing committee who participated in these seminars. I would like to make some brief comments about each of the reports today and hopefully expand on these in the main committee at a future date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first seminar during the recent winter break dealt with a review of the Australian aid program. The seminar was held at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who asked the committee to conduct a seminar on the report of a review committee chaired by Mr Paul Simons. That report was released in early May and the minister undertook that there would be a period of wide public consultation before the report was considered by government. Our seminar was one of a number of seminars and conferences held around the country dealing with aspects of the Simons report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was very pleased to have all of the members of the Simons committee present at the seminar&mdash;Paul Simons, Gaye Hart and Cliff Walsh&mdash;and also the Director&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7607"> General of AusAID, Trevor Kanaley, and a significant number of his staff. We were also pleased that the head of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, Mr James Michel, who was visiting Australia at the time, was able to join us for some of the discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons review is the first major review of the development assistance program since the Jackson report of the early 1980s. It was the general feeling that reviews of this kind need to be done somewhat more regularly&mdash;a 13&hyphen;year gap is too great. One of the recommendations of the Simons committee endorsed by the joint standing committee was for the establishment of an advisory board to assist AusAID management in the direction of the development assistance program. Hopefully, with such input, the process of finetuning the aid program will be simplified for all involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar did not set out to cover all aspects of the Simons report. Anyone who has examined that report will know that it is an extremely comprehensive examination of the aid program. However, the seminar did look at issues such as overseas trends in development assistance; refocusing the aid program, taking into account geographic and sectoral factors; soft loans and concessional financing; the question of whether Australian aid should be untied; and the whole issue of NGOs and the Australian aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons committee's report carries the title, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One clear objective: poverty reduction through sustainable development.</EMPHASIS> The joint committee supports the concept that the prime motivation for a development assistance program is humanitarian. The committee did have some concerns, however, that too narrow a definition of poverty may be adopted. Development assistance encompasses a range of activities designed to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries whether through infrastructure projects, educational activities, assistance to micro enterprises as well as immediate assistance to those suffering from hunger and homelessness. The committee agrees that assistance should be through sustainable development activities. The committee also acknowledges 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that other policy objectives may be met through the aid program without detracting from its fundamental purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint standing committee has made 15 recommendations in all regarding the Simons review and the general running of the aid program. The committee remains concerned about the obvious resource implications for AusAID&mdash;both staffing and budgetary&mdash;should all of the recommendations of the Simons review be instituted. This will obviously be a matter of great importance for the government at this time of budgetary restrictions, but it will have to be addressed if Australia is to maximise the impact of its aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report being tabled today concerns the Commonwealth of Nations and, given the imminent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh, it is particularly relevant and timely. The committee was interested in examining whether the Commonwealth remains relevant in the post&hyphen;Cold War period, and indeed whether it is of even more relevance given the momentous changes in the international arena that have occurred over the last decade. The Commonwealth has changed in many ways since the days when it was the British Commonwealth, and it was quickly apparent to the committee that a number of misconceptions still exist about its organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar covered topics such as the role of CHOGM and other meetings; public perceptions of the Commonwealth; the `unofficial Commonwealth', that is, the vast number of non&hyphen;government organisations that exist among Commonwealth countries; the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association; trade and investment issues; and human rights and the Commonwealth. Time does not permit me to go into any depth on these issues here today, but I would recommend the report and the transcript of the seminar to all who have an interest in the Commonwealth and the remarkably diverse benefits that flow from it to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude my remarks today by once again thanking all who gave of their time to participate in these seminars. The committee found the seminar process to be a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7608"> most useful means of exploring issues in a comparatively short time frame and believes the reports contain a number of issues that merit consideration by government. I commend the two reports to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I would initially like to thank the committee staff who did an excellent job in preparing this report, and in particular David Dick who was seconded across to work on this report and who was dropped into the middle of what at times were very lively committee meetings and public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report puts forward a number of recommendations, in particular to do with union election balloting procedures. It makes a number of recommendations to do with the style of envelope which, while it may seem a very small issue to the majority of Australians listening today, is important for the integrity processes in such ballots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also makes a series of recommendations to do with the access to the rolls in union elections, the quality of the rolls, the access that the returning officer has to a roll, and the access that a returning officer has to deal with what is potentially a roll with many addresses that are missing. This is something that is not uncommon in a union election because members tend to move&mdash;from my own experience, many times&mdash;during the two or three years in between elections taking place.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A preselection? Senator Ellison, I wouldn't start! One of the hard things that the committee had to grapple with was wanting to balance the rights of members to have access to the roll, so that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> democratic process of conducting an election could take place, with the capacity not to disenfranchise members of the union in terms of having a say. The committee tossed that around a bit and came to quite a balanced outcome in the end for both democratic process and voter eligibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recommend that a set of model rules be developed on balloting procedures, that it not be mandatory for unions to adopt it, but that unions be encouraged to move to the model rules. That would certainly see a cost saving for the AEC if that were to be adopted. We received much evidence about the excellent job that has been done by the Electoral Commission, over many years and in sometimes quite trying circumstances, and because of that I think the committee members were swayed into supporting the AEC's ongoing participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was discussion at various times about whether or not the AEC should charge unions for use of AEC resources, but on balance it was felt that the role that they provide and the excellent service was balanced by the need to maintain as much democratic process as possible for the unions, so that people were sure that the integrity of the process was being adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the most significant recommendation that we are making is for the AEC to be able to be involved in non&hyphen;industrial elections. That means that an organisation like the NRMA, which recently had a bit of a hiccup with one of its ballots, would be able to approach the AEC and ask it to conduct its elections on a fee for service basis. The AEC could then charge them a fee. Everybody would be happy that the integrity of the AEC could be put to work in an NRMA ballot or one for a similar non&hyphen;industrial organisation. I think that is an excellent recommendation and I hope that the government moves as quickly as the legislative program allows and that we see legislation some time over the next 12 months to allow the AEC to work on those matters. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled deals with two treaties which were tabled on 17 June 1997, and all but two of the treaties tabled on 26 August 1997. The latter will be the subject of later reports: the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty, and the economic and commercial cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan. As none of the treaties dealt with in this report raised particular issues of concern to the committee, in each case we have recommended ratification as proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However they do raise a more general issue for the committee and for the parliament, one to which frustratingly we seem to refer at the tabling of each report. In his statement to the house on 2 May 1996 about the reforms to the treaty&hyphen;making process, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in part (and I quote):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"They will . . . ensure that every Australian individual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known. Consultation will be the key word."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee agrees with the minister but takes a strong view that consultation is not simply a word but a meaningful process. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this tenth report, we considered eleven treaties. In all cases, information about these treaties was provided to the states and territories through the Standing Committee on Treaties process of officials. In a number of cases this was the only `consultation' which took place, in spite of the fact that there are well&hyphen;known bodies which should have been given the opportunity to put their views forward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is simply not good enough. Either the minister's words mean what they say, or they don't. Some of the more cynical individuals and non government organisations making submissions to the committee over recent months have suggested that we are both a mouth&hyphen;piece of government and a ratification rubber stamp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me assure the senate that we are neither and that we will continue to explore the issues objectively and independently. I feel sure that ministers and the parliament would want it no other way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 25 August 1997, my colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Moreton, referred to a perceived difficulty in changing the narrow view of consultation that exists in several departments and agencies. That situation persists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, it is in the unambiguous interest of the executive and the parliament to enhance the process of consultation if the government's commendable and ground&hyphen;breaking initiatives in treaty making are to be maintained. I hope that every effort will be made to that end.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Extradition (Hong Kong) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 123 and made under the Extradition Act 1988, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The regulations before the Senate seek to endorse the Australian government's move to establish an extradition treaty between Australia and part of China&mdash;namely, Hong Kong. It is a very unusual move because, as a sovereign nation, we are used to entering into treaties with other sovereign nations not parts of, provinces of or so&hyphen;called administrative regions of other countries. If you can reverse the situation, this is somewhat akin to China entering into an extradition arrangement with Tasmania. It seems very odd indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The progress towards this treaty was set in train before the reversion of Hong Kong to China earlier this year. However, that event changes greatly the arrangement between Australia and China&mdash;namely, the part of China called Hong Kong. We no longer have a Hong Kong region which is either a colony of Britain and therefore subject, to some degree, to the rule of law as we understand it or an independent nation able to determine for itself its own laws. What we have is an administrative region of China which is totally at the mercy of China and the Chinese government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means that Chinese rule of law is essentially able to be imposed on Hong Kong despite the current differences arising from Hong Hong's colonial history. It will be argued that if that is the case an extradition treaty between Australia and Hong Kong provides for the treaty to be made null and void by either side within six months of their displeasure at events. The question I put is: what happens to those citizens caught in the trap in the intervening six months? You can guarantee that if there is to be a change to this extraordinary treaty between Australia and Hong Kong that change will only come as a result of uproar because a citizen or citizens have come to grief as a result of the Chinese government changing the situation in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the Chinese government change the situation in Hong Kong? The answer is yes it will, according to its own needs. Is there a precedent? Yes, there is. China, you may recall, entered into an arrangement with Great Britain to have a change of rule in Hong Kong on 1 July this year. Part of that arrangement was for a legislative council to be established under the previous colonial British government. That legislative council, contrary to the provisions of that change of aegis, has been abolished and replaced by a non&hyphen;democratically appointed legislative council under the aegis of the Chinese government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have I got other concerns about this treaty? Yes, I have. The Greens, as with many Australian citizens, are only too aware of the facts about the Chinese legal system. There are thousands of executions per annum. If you peruse the international press you find that almost daily there is another figure put on the list of so-called criminals who are executed in China. It has by far the greatest execution rate in the world, and that is saying something when you look at the rising rate of executions in the United States. They number in the thousands. One estimate is 6,000 in the last year for which figures were kept. That is contrary to the Australian situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, we know that China is a country which denies its citizens basic civil rights and freedoms which we take for granted in this country, not least of which is democracy itself, but of course the right to speak out about the actions of government and to vent different opinions. However, those opinions might not be liked by the powers that be. We know that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Chinese prisons because they have a different point of view from the Chinese government in Beijing. We know that, for example, one of the new laws being brought into Hong Kong is the potential of three years imprisonment for defacing or defiling the Chinese flag. It would be a great worry if we had a similar penalty here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me take a case in point where China itself is not only a country with a different set of laws and a very frightening set of laws for citizens compared with Australia but also a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country that is prepared to break international law. I speak about Mr James Peng, who, as we know, was abducted from Macao into China, tried in China in a court situation which can only be seen as failing the basic tenets of justice as we know it and is enduring 18 years imprisonment as a result. There have been protests from at least two Australian governments about Mr Peng's situation but here we are entering into an agreement essentially with the same government which kidnapped and tried, under abhorrent conditions, Mr Peng, who, as we know, came from this country. I find that a very worrying set of circumstances. But it is not just me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Janet Hunt, the Executive Director of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACFOA is gravely concerned that signing a treaty with Hong Kong undermines Australia's long practice of not signing extradition treaties with countries that have a record of human rights abuses. This treaty is of particular concern because the People's Republic of China practices the death penalty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">David Bitel, the Secretary&hyphen;General of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue was discussed at the meeting of the ICJ Council on 16 June 1997 and it was agreed that it was inappropriate for Australia to enter into such a Treaty with a country which does not adhere to the rule of law, which applies the death penalty and where there is no certainty that people would receive a fair trial.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course what applies to China applies specifically to Hong Kong. So there are enormous concerns about this proposed treaty. I will quote from another legal source. Lindsay Houghton from Deacons Graham &amp; James, a firm of lawyers in Australia, summarised a very erudite statement of concern by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in our opinion, it is of concern that a country such as Australia that has often protested the human rights abuses in China (particularly in relation to James Peng) and who has already witnessed China fail to honour one of its obligations under the Joint Declaration (the abolishment of the provisional legislature set up by the British), is willing to surrender its own citizens under an agreement which in no way whatsoever provides "watertight" protection of their human rights once they are surrendered to the HKSAR. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7612">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that the opposition of the Australian Greens to this regulation and therefore this treaty with China to allow extradition of Australians to Hong Kong and vice versa is going to fail to get the support of the government, the opposition and the Democrats. Be that as it may, I have nevertheless thoroughly gone through the quite complex arguments in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid for those people who will be extradited to Hong Kong. I am concerned that they are being handed to the Chinese government. I am concerned that, notwithstanding the differences between Hong Kong and the rest of China, ultimately it is the Chinese authorities we have to keep our eyes on. I am concerned about the precedents that have been set not least of which by the criminal behaviour of the Chinese government in the case of James Peng.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that there is the potential for Australian citizens or citizens of other countries handed over to the Chinese authorities to be unfairly tried and sentenced to spend years in prison as a result of activities which would not entertain the same penalties here in Australia, or to face the death penalty. I know the argument opposite will be, `We have put arguments to you in writing,' or `You have not given us the opportunity to negotiate this.' But here I am as one senator covering a whole range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken those government arguments in their written form and I have listened to the wise counsel of those people in our community who are concerned about this treaty, concerned for civil rights, concerned for the rule of law as we know it, concerned that we do not make mistakes or deliver up people to a system which is abhorrent to the Australian sense of justice and concerned that we do not put ourselves in a situation where we will say, `That was bad luck. Too bad for those citizens. Within six months we will withdraw from this bilateral arrangement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not good enough. The Chinese government's record&mdash;look at Tibet, for goodness sake!&mdash;is not good enough. We ought not be entering into an arrangement which I understand has been held up in the United States Senate because of concerns very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar to those that I have put forward. It may be that the United States has proceeded in recent months, for reasons of its own, to an arrangement with China. Nevertheless, for the reasons I have put forward, we should not be proceeding. The precautionary principle at least should be intervening here to ensure justice for people on our shores.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this disallowance motion and, in doing so, I would like to put on the record the opposition's views&mdash;both concern and attitude. We will not be supporting Senator Brown this afternoon. Senator Brown has raised a matter of concern, a matter which should be acknowledged in this place. It does give rise to considerations of issues such as the status of Hong Kong, the status of the rights of people of Hong Kong, the relationship of Hong Kong with the PRC on an ongoing basis and all issues of rights which flow from that relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been a party to a process in this parliament which has seen it consider the treaty at a number of different levels and, of course, now the regulations that are before us. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, for instance, had the agreement before it. The committee came to the position that the arrangements with Hong Kong should be pursued and should be allowed to flow through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, I think a lot of the discussion in respect of this arrangement happened before the change of government. What has obviously changed since that change of government has been the status of Hong Kong. I think Senator Brown is right to raise issues of human rights but also issues of legality. These are issues which, for instance, go to the question of whether, under the government's empowering legislation, an arrangement such as this could be entered into with Hong Kong when Hong Kong may not, in fact, satisfy the needs of that legislation in that it is not a country for the purposes of such legislation. I think there are other such issues that also will be brought to light as cases which are currently pending before courts on issues such as these continue to proceed and develop.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7613">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been involved in terms of parliamentary scrutiny through the treaties committee, and that committee gave a tick to the agreements in place. The opposition has also been involved at other levels, as I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is not to support Senator Brown on this particular occasion, but we do give notice to the government that we are going to be keeping a very close eye on the operation of the treaty. We will primarily keep a very close eye on court proceedings pending at the moment to see how the courts come down as to the legality of the treaty that is involved. We will also keep a close eye on how the rights of the people of Hong Kong and the rights of the people who may be sent back to Hong Kong are maintained and protected when those people do go back or when those people are considered by the mechanisms of the authority in place in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not think there is much more that I need to say at this particular stage, other than to say once again to Senator Brown: I do appreciate your raising this matter. I understand that it is a matter of concern to you and should be of continuing concern to this parliament. It is a matter that we on this side of the parliament will keep a very close eye on in the ways that I have mentioned. This will ensure that the concerns that you have do not materialise. To the extent that any concerns do develop and emerge, we will be looking to take whatever action might be appropriate to ensure that those concerns do not have a life of their own and the issues that you raise do not develop into major ones.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Brown has mentioned, the Democrats will not be supporting this disallowance motion, which I have already told him about. We heard from Senator Brown earlier about the Chinese legal system. As somebody who has been to China twice to study the legal system&mdash;it was for only two weeks on each occasion, but it was very intense&mdash;I cannot agree with him more. The legal system in China is very basic, and its study of human rights is incredibly basic. China has not even signed the ICCPR or the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ICESCR, although I do understand that they have plans to sign both of those international covenants next year. I hope that does happen. Of course, they do subscribe to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but they do not do it particularly well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that I have also been to Hong Kong and just participated in the writing of a report on the current system in Hong Kong. It is very different from the system in China. For a start, the death penalty does not exist and, interestingly, Mr C.H. Tung, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, has said that he does not believe the death penalty is something that is appropriate in Hong Kong. He would not have said that if he had not discussed that with the Chinese authorities, because that is the way things happen in China and that is the way things happen in Hong Kong now. So I do not believe that we will see the death penalty in Hong Kong for a very long time, if we see it at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that Hong Kong has a very different legal system from China. The legal system in Hong Kong is really a subsystem of the legal system in Britain. It is a common law system. In fact, I understand that invitations have been sent to two very senior Australian judges to participate as common law judges in the final court of appeal in the legal system in Hong Kong. That would definitely be a step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments are complex, and I have gone through them as well. At the moment, the Democrats agree that the extradition treaty should go ahead because the legal system has not changed in Hong Kong. We are assured through the basic law and the joint declaration that it will not. It is set out in both of those documents that it will be a common law system and that it will be maintained in the way that we expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, did not believe that nothing would change with the handover of sovereignty from the UK to China. Things have changed subtly, but not to an enormous extent yet. It is still possible for people to exercise their basic rights of disagreement with the government, and that is excellent. Things are subtly changing, but they have not changed to the Chinese legal system and I do not think they will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7614"> because the Hong Kong legal system is far more advanced, organised and studied for than the Chinese legal system is. If anything is going to happen, it will be that the Hong Kong legal system will maintain itself. I do not think it will just suddenly turn into the Chinese system, where there is an incredible lack of education for the roles which people are called upon to assume. I do not think that will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention a couple of things in the extradition treaty. I am sure Senator Brown has read articles 3 and 4. Article 4 is about the death penalty; if anything does look like it is going to attract the death penalty, you do not have to hand people over. I have had assurances from the department that that would be case; if it looked like the death penalty were going to be introduced in Hong Kong, no&hyphen;one would be handed over. The government of Australia does reserve the right under article 3 to refuse the surrender of its nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown also brought up the matter of James Peng. It is a good point. In fact, I raised that with the department as well. James Peng was kidnapped, as Senator Brown said, from the Portuguese colony of Macau and taken to China. He almost got out, according to newspaper articles. He was almost thrown out of China and sent back to Australia, but not quite. I live in hope that that will happen very soon and that he will not have another 17 years in a Chinese gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been into Chinese gaols, but I have been into only the best ones, the showcase ones, and they really are not terribly pleasant. I imagine the others are a lot less pleasant. They are not particularly pleasant places for anybody at all, particularly if the person is not well&mdash;and I understand Mr Peng is not. I hope that we will see him back in Australia soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to vote in favour of this extradition treaty going ahead because the legal system in Hong Kong is very different from the legal system in China. I hope and I believe that it will remain very different from the legal system in China. I do believe that the death penalty will not be brought in in Hong Kong. I certainly hope that any changes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the legal system in Hong Kong will not encompass it becoming anything less than it is at the moment. But if that does happen, if the legal system starts to deteriorate in Hong Kong and if the death penalty is brought in, then we have every right to get out of this extradition treaty because it is based on the basic law and the joint declaration. If those two documents are not carried out in regard to the legal system, then that will mean that we will have the right&mdash;and I would take that right up immediately&mdash;to get out of this extradition treaty. I hope that is what would happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Bolkus, we will be certainly watching what happens in Hong Kong and recommending that, if anything untoward does happen, we immediately take up article 3 and not send anybody else back and also take up that last article which allows us to get right of out the treaty altogether with six months notice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very dangerous for Australia to enter into agreements on the basis that things might be okay and, if they are not working out okay, we might be able to get out of them in the longer term. I believe that both of the major parties tend to have a one&hyphen;China policy&mdash;and the government is free to disabuse me if that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Hong Kong took on more elements of the rest of China law, then what would be the basis on which the Australian government would make representations? If it has not done that already on the basis of this treaty, then that becomes very difficult. If it is taken up on an individual case by case basis, then that is still not necessarily a basis for withdrawing from the treaty. I think that is a concern for a lot of people who may already be, or could potentially be, in a situation where their lives might be at risk or their freedom might be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it is the kind of treaty we should jump into if there is not a clear line or a clear basis upon which Australia has previously entered into treaties with parts of countries. That is another thing the government might like to respond to. Is it normal for Australia to enter into agreements with parts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7615"> of countries? Has Australia done that before? What does that mean in terms of the status of the treaty or the future of the treaty if changes occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Various parts of China have different status. There is the Tibet autonomous region, the Xianjiang province and other provinces, and people in those provinces might not think their special treatment is particularly special or laudable. In this particular instance, I will heed the calls of those groups in the community who are saying that this is the wrong way to go for Australia to leap into this treaty agreement. It may well be seen to be good for trade but it might not be good for the messages we are giving on human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Harradine has asked me to apologise that he is unable to be involved in this debate because he has commitments in a committee. But he has asked me to indicate that he is supportive of the disallowance motion. It is a pity that we have not seen Senator O'Chee respond in the chamber&mdash;perhaps he might come in later&mdash;because from time to time he has been very strong on the issue of Chinese human rights and has raised the issue of James Peng to the chamber on more than one occasion. I would be very keen to see what he personally believes in relation to Australia entering into this treaty and the impact it is likely to have on such people now or in the future. I will be supporting the motion and I urge other honourable senators to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a good debate. I am glad to have had the opportunity to express my concerns. However, I will go away from this debate with those concerns still felt. I think there is the grave possibility of miscarriage of justice when we are exchanging citizens&mdash;albeit through the Hong Kongese front door&mdash;with a country renowned around the world for its failure to abide by basic human rights and for its awesome retribution on large numbers of citizens through the death penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there are checks and balances in place here. But, as I have said earlier, we run the great risk that people will get caught up. It will only be at the expense of people who come to grief under this extradition treaty that at some future day it will be reconsidered and withdrawn, if the need for that arises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope, as do other senators, that that situation will not arise. But we have to do better than hope. We have to look at the reality not only of the Chinese system applying everywhere else except Hong Kong but also of the famous ability of China to change tack&mdash;with massive changes in the way it structures its society&mdash;on an average of once every decade since 1949. From this we know what a danger it is to be entering into an agreement with a provincial part of China, which is essentially signed by the government in Hong Kong because nothing gets signed in Hong Kong without the authority of the government. It is a treaty arrangement that is fraught with danger.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R237">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  will cut vital funding from the vocational education and training portfolio. This bill is a travesty. It is short&hyphen;sighted, and it is yet another indictment of this government's myopia with regard to the future of education and the future of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 budget announced a cut to Commonwealth vocational education and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training grants to states and territories of $20 million per calendar year, beginning next year. This bill will implement this budget cut. It will cut $14.3 million from vocational education and training and another $72 million from education and training grants to the states. That means that a total of $86.3 million will be slashed from vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 budget saw the government confirm its slash and burn approach to most portfolios which are vital to Australians. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget saw Dr Kemp slash $183 million from the vocational education and training budget. Over the last two budgets, around $270 million has been withdrawn from vocational education and training. This is a portfolio which provides training, education and industry skills to a range of Australians looking to get ahead in what is a harsh world of stagnant employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training is fundamental to the job success of every Australian. Whilst it is vital for potential job seekers, it is also vital for a healthy economy. Any cut to funding will be devastating for Australian training and, ultimately, will not provide young Australians with the level of industry training which they so desperately require. Without an adequately and properly funded apprenticeship and traineeship program, Australia will continue to go down the path of having a disproportionately low&hyphen;skilled, low&hyphen;wage work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disaster for our economy, our industry investment prospects and, ultimately, it will destroy any chance we have of creating an environment which will realise the full potential of our industry, our workers and our economy. It is yet another example of this government, when faced with the high&hyphen;wage, high&hyphen;skill, high&hyphen;employment route, taking the low path and saying, as I think the Australian Business Foundation so eloquently put it, `Okay, what we'll do is organise some Mc&hyphen;training for you and you might end up with a Mc&hyphen;job.' I think it is a real shame that we are going down the low path with regard to industry policy and the economy, and this is an example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is passed, we will be locked into a level of basic funding that will be inad 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7617"> equate and appalling. We are already considered to be not up to international standard. How can we be up to international standard? When you look at the funding cuts and an expanded VET sector, which includes the so&hyphen;called new apprenticeships, there are simply not enough funds. As Senator Carr has pointed out, this seems to be the ploy of the government. This government institutes arrangements that slash and burn portfolios, therefore placing added constraints and imposts on departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this to provide for a so&hyphen;called efficient and effective system. But for whom? It is certainly not efficient and effective for the people of Australia. It is certainly not efficient and effective for young people who are desperate to get adequate and proper training in order to get jobs. Who is it for? It is for the government. It is about the budget bottom line. It is about fiscal policy before social, economic and industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a fiscal perspective, it will be efficient and effective for the government. They will not have to deal with the consequences of their slash and burn mentality in their pursuit of the budget bottom line. They will not have to deal with the consequences at the coalface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see that the states and territories have been ignored&mdash;this bill is clear evidence of that. The states and territories have been protesting against Dr Kemp's so&hyphen;called `efficiency targets'. I hardly think that this budget measure, which will be implemented with this bill, is an `incentive', to use the word used by Senator Brownhill in the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About one month ago, as has already been stated by a number of senators, Dr Kemp threatened to withdraw an offer of $4.5 billion for TAFE funding over the next five years if the states did not accept the vocational education and training deal. Let us have a look at what the deal was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states had to find 500,000 additional training places over the term of the deal without extra funding. A government source is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of 20 September 1997 as saying that Dr Kemp's position of being a bully, effectively `throws cooperative federalism out the door'. He was joined 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in throwing effective federalism out the door by Peter Costello who, I think, for the first time, aborted a COAG meeting where there was no agreement with states with regard to cuts to funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reluctant agreement by the states&mdash;I stress the word `reluctant'; probably `extorted agreement' may be a better term for it&mdash;has locked them into finding $286 million a year of operating efficiencies to help fund the equivalent of 40,000 additional full&hyphen;time TAFE places. In a leaked ANTA briefing paper, there is clear and damning evidence that Dr Kemp's efficiency drive is simply not going to work. ANTA said that Australia has fallen behind in best practice in participation, the conversion of participation into tangible qualifications and in the qualifications themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make Dr Kemp's case even more intellectually moribund, the briefing paper by ANTA is critical of the government's attempt to squeeze additional places out of the TAFE system through efficiency. As ANTA said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the states and territories to deliver efficiency gains of this order within a single calendar year is problematic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is probably the understatement of the century! In the minority report from the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee, Labor and the Democrats both state on page 20 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State efficiency gains of the magnitude proposed by the Commonwealth are unrealistic and unachievable. The states have achieved, on average, around one per cent per annum base line efficiency improvements over the last five years. This national, average efficiency growth would fund only between nine per cent and twenty per cent of the required growth in VET clients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When this is taken into account, with the other demands upon states, the additional impost that this government has placed on states and the TAFE system itself, is it any wonder that state education ministers were screaming? As has been previously indicated, for example, the Victorian training minister, Mr Honeywood is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp's arrogance has no bounds . . . It is unfortunate that Minister Kemp is acting like an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7618"> endangered species who will say anything to protect his hide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that Premier Kennett had similarly favourable things to say about the Prime Minister around about that time with regard to the results of the COAG negotiations. Dr Kemp is doing his government and his party no favours with his inept public relations and policy directives. No wonder the Commonwealth and state relationships are fragmenting and the schism is widening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not even take into account the ability of states or territories to fund additional VET growth from efficiencies. I know that states have agreed to allow efficiencies to be negotiated with ANTA, but it still remains to be seen how the states and territories manage their efficiencies. Also highlighted in the minority report are concerns from states&mdash;and that includes my own state of Tasmania that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth is not providing funding to support new apprenticeships and common youth allowance initiatives, and that young people are having their expectations raised unrealistically.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from page 23 of the minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read all the supposed good news stories regarding the new apprenticeship scheme. In fact, in Tasmania we were honoured by a flying visit from the good doctor, when he came down to allegedly give Tasmania another 3,000 new apprenticeships. However, like every other Liberal government, the state Liberal government was not conned by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sue Napier, who is the Deputy Premier, said that this was a publicity stunt, a marketing ploy, a public relations exercise and a con. It was a repackaging of the traditional apprenticeships scheme. That was the reality. She knew it; we knew it; everybody knows it&mdash;there was no new money. It was Dr Spin all over again. There is no new money. It was bad for Tasmania and it was bad for Australia. She said so publicly very quickly, might I say, along with many other Liberal governments we have talked about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Kemp must believe that state and territory ministers came down in the last shower if he thinks that they are going to cop such outrageous nonsense and that you can fly into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a state&mdash;he did the same thing in Victoria and other states&mdash;re-announce an existing program, provide no new money and then fly out again. It is just as well he left the next day, because there was an absolute furore in the media in relation to it. It was exposed as being fallacious and the con that it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no new funding for this scheme. Indeed, how can there be with the magnitude of the cuts to VET that we are talking about? When Senator Vanstone was questioned back in April about the KPMG consultants' report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Costing and resourcing of new apprenticeships</EMPHASIS>, she was unable to respond. This report was very clear in its statement that resources must be lifted from the current 20 per cent to 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the vocation education budget. This means that an increase of $400 million to $500 million would be needed to fund the government's new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Dr Kemp made a splash in the media about $550 million for at least 220,000 apprenticeships and traineeships in the next two years&mdash;Dr Spin again. Whilst nobody in this chamber would disagree with promoting new apprenticeships in areas such as information technology and multi media, as well as more traditional areas&mdash;everybody agrees with that&mdash;there are two basic problems with what Dr Kemp is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing is that there is no underpinning industry policy to drive that. There is no direction there to say which way our economy should be going. In fact, you have to look at this in terms of the cuts there have been to industry policies and also with regard to the dismantling of labour market programs and so on. But also&mdash;I ask again&mdash;where is the money? It is not there. Again we have an example of an ephemeral PR stunt from Dr Kemp. He has attempted to portray the government as providing more money for training. This is conning the general public as well as young Australians. That is the real tragedy of it. This bill is very clear: there is a cut. Funds for vocational education and training are reduced, not increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at Dr Kemp's assertion that apprenticeships and traineeships have increased under this government. Despite the rhetoric that this is a new apprenticeships 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7619"> scheme, it is just the continuation, as everybody here knows, of annual commencements. The number of traditional four&hyphen;year trade apprenticeships have fallen, not risen. Dr Kemp's own department has confirmed this. In the last round of Senate estimates, the number of apprenticeships in 1996&hyphen;97 was down 2,000 on 1995&hyphen;96 figures. Independent officers in DEETYA confirmed that 46,000 apprenticeships are the 1996&hyphen;97 figure, down from 48,000 apprenticeships in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of growth of traineeships has slowed to a snail's pace under this government. It has gone from 117 per cent in Labor's last year of office to at best 44 per cent in the last year&mdash;with no growth predicted for the next year. Why? Because Dr Kemp and John Howard, in the first two budgets, have cut vocational education and training by nearly $270 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of this utter devastation of the sector have been fewer apprenticeships and a deceleration of traineeship take&hyphen;ups. Therefore, is it any wonder that there is an increase in youth unemployment and in unemployment more generally? The youth unemployment rate has in fact risen over the term of this government from 26.8 per cent in February 1996 to 27.3 per cent. The unemployment rate, of course, is rising. Last month we saw for the first time in Australia's history&mdash;as has been indicated in this chamber before&mdash;a negative growth in employment in a non&hyphen;recessionary period in Australia. Obviously, things have picked up a little since then, but the problem is that there is no plan and no strategy. So the sorts of things that the government talks about are simply not enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is self&hyphen;defeating. It chases the fiscal and budget bottom line whilst dismantling labour market programs and cutting funds to VET. Yet the Howard government fails to factor in the real cost of unemployment, which is extremely serious, in terms of the human cost of unemployment. But if you are all about the budget bottom line&mdash;which this government is&mdash;you have to look at, from their perspective, how much unemployment costs the taxpayer. Unemployment is estimated to cost Australia up to $40 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion in economic terms alone. That obviously includes multipliers as well as direct costs and so. That is horrendous&mdash;and there are the human costs which are tragic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Encapsulated in this new apprenticeships and traineeships scheme is the user choice funding aspect. Whilst the minority report acknowledges that the bill does not explicitly provide for user choice mechanisms, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entire bill assumes operation of user choice approach to delivering training.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, Senator Brownhill referred to this in his speech during the second reading debate. As of I January 1998 TAFE colleges will be competing with around 2,500 private training providers for a share of $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This user choice model channels public money via employers and industry to training providers who contract to provide specific training services over a specific period. As the Australian Education Union submission eloquently argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">User choice funding, where the public money for new apprenticeships and traineeships goes to the employer who then chooses the provider of choice from a range of public and private providers in the so called competitive training market, takes the notion of competitive funding practices even further than competitive tendering. It is intended to give this country an employer led VET system, as distinct from an industry led system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a very important distinction there. In a submission to the committee, the Building and Construction Council of New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A "demand driven training system" will concentrate on the short term needs of the employer and apprentices whilst ignoring the long term requirements of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Therefore, we have what is really an artificial training market that does not relate to anything&mdash;industry policy, needs or employment generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This user choice funding, along with an artificial training market, raises concerns over the level of skills achieved. In this brave new world of the new industrial relations environment, the welfare of apprentices and trainees is paramount. I will not repeat it at the same level it was repeated last week, I just remind this chamber that a number of government ministers and backbenchers have come out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7620"> and said we actually need, as Senator Vanstone put it, `a freer labour market and lessened job security'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only speculate&mdash;you would not have to speculate too hard&mdash;about what will happen to young people, apprentices and trainees under the current industrial relations system that this government instituted, never mind a second&hyphen;wave industrial relations system. There is immense internal pressure within the Liberal Party to institute a second&hyphen;wave system. To quote the Australian Education Union submission again, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people will be guinea pigs for a new industrial relations system, and will be forced into an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA) as a condition of receiving education and training.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new apprenticeship system, the employer and employee and union negotiated training and employment arrangements should then go together to choose the best provider for the training. No body believes that the practice will be anything like this. Unfortunately, young people are not in an equal relationship with their prospective employers and employer's choice of training provider may not be made on a basis of quality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The other implications of this system which are implicit within this bill are that unemployed people or people with low skilled jobs wishing to change career direction and enhance their employment chances will be denied access to vocational training of certain kinds. As the submission by the National Tertiary Education Industry Union said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means, also, that employees could only enter into such training with express support and approach of their employers. Thus access is reduced and in a fundamental way individual rights are denied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I thought this government was about choice, but individual rights are denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another curious factor is the minister's comment that the government will be committing new funds to enable an additional 18,000 young people to take up apprenticeships and traineeships at school. However, during the same Senate estimates hearing, the department admitted that only 900 young people would start apprenticeships and traineeships at school. These are the sorts of inconsistencies that this bill emphasises.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combination of the cuts this bill seeks to implement and the implicit assumptions about the user choice model and training provisions leads me to question the government's commitment to vocational education and training, to say the least. I believe that this government is selling Australians short. There is no way that Australia will live up to its potential under this government with these sorts of initiatives.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7620" TIME="5.48 p.m." SPEAKER="Ellison, Sen Chris" NAMEID="9X5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(5.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions to this matter. At the outset, let me dispel one aspect of the debate and that is in relation to the position of the states and territories on the new funding level, and that growth will be derived from efficiencies. In fact, I think it was a point overlooked by Senator Stott Despoja and opposition senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the communique dated 25 September 1997, the state and territory ministers said they were pleased that the Commonwealth government had recognised the need to apply some of the immediate gains from efficiencies to improvement and restructuring the system, which would enhance the prospects of further efficiency gains in the medium term to pay increases and other programs to support the national training framework. In fact, in that communique you can see that the state and territory ministers agreed with the Commonwealth, and agreement was reached. It was not a question of any sort of extortion. It was agreed that the states' and territories' individual circumstances would be taken into account and that there would be an agreed process to develop efficiency plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Carr's comments, I say at the outset that Victoria's cost benchmarks will not be imposed. The question of funding cuts has been the subject of comment. The government disputes that there have been the huge cuts in TAFE funding as outlined by Senator Carr. In fact, funding to the states and territories has increased in real terms every year up to and including 1997. In 1997&hyphen;1998, total Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training&mdash;not just for the states and territories&mdash;has increased by some $144 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7621"> million over the last financial year of the former government. The government has given a commitment to maintain 1998 funding in real terms for three years up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question of the funding cuts reducing the quality to such a base that it would not compare internationally, I looked to the dissenting report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee which dealt with this bill. I note that the dissenting senators agreed that Australia's participation rate for 15&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds is close to world's best practice. In fact, the situation with vocational education and training in Australia is very high indeed when one looks at it from an international perspective. The government is, of course, concerned with quality. Its prime aim is to look at quality  in training in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the privatisation aspect, it is a shared objective of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories to develop the training market. This means a strong TAFE system that will operate alongside and in competition with other providers. There is no reason that cannot happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the states and territories&mdash;except New South Wales, which has reserved its position&mdash;have agreed to implement user choice for apprenticeship and traineeship training from the beginning of 1998. User choice, after all, is about improving the quality of training, not reducing it as claimed by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers acting jointly with their apprentices and trainees will be able to choose the best provider to deliver the training, and that could be either a TAFE or another provider. I might say that the provider in any event will have to meet the state and territory requirements for registration and deliver training that leads to a nationally recognised qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drive for efficiencies, which the states and territories have accepted, is not about cost cutting or reducing quality. It is about making better use of the substantial contribution taxpayers make to supporting vocational education and training. It is about creating additional quality training places, especially for young people. The communique dated 20 September this year that I mentioned outlines 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that very point. I think that agreement reached in September of this year is an aspect Senator Stott Despoja failed to grasp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question of Victorian TAFE mergers, Mr Honeywood, the minister in that state, is on the record as saying that the proposed mergers are to better position TAFE services to industry and students, that efficiencies are a secondary concern and that any efficiencies derived are to be ploughed back into the TAFE system. I do not see any problem at all in a statement of that sort. The opposition and the Democrats are merely trying to beat this up, trying to create some division which does not exist. The TAFE system is not under any cloud at all. It is simply a question of the TAFEs operating with other providers in a competitive environment.</PARA>

So, when you say that I am not following the advice of my department in that regard, I just wish to place on record that that is not correct.

TAFE institutes have had to bear the cost of reductions in funding to the general FAGS, which has an impact on the amounts of money available to the states. Not only have there been cuts through the labour market programs; there have been direct cuts as a result of efficiency dividends required by the VET component of the department of employment, education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking of the efficiency gains that are required to fund the government's new VET policies, ANTA has advised the department that if growth in VET is to be funded by efficiency alone, which appears to be the basis of this agreement in the memorandum of understanding, in clause 1, reductions in the average recurrent expenditure per annum on curriculum of between 3.8 per cent and 7.9 per cent would be required.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I cannot say that those figures are accurate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I think this very much goes to the heart of the problem. You have the Commonwealth asking the states to fund its initiatives. You once had a joint arrangement between the states and the Commonwealth in regard to the ANTA agreement where the Commonwealth committed growth funding to the tune of some $70 million a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You now have acknowledged that you do not know what the costs are of Commonwealth initiatives in regard to these areas: additional VET places; youth allowance; additional new apprenticeships; national training packages; and VET in schools. I find it an extraordinary proposition, Minister, that you would ask the states to basically buy a pig in a poke. You are asking the states essentially to fund your initiatives without, of course, any commitment from the Commonwealth to additional resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your advice from ANTA has been that since growth levels may vary between states and territories, the required reductions in unit expenditure at the state and territory level will vary widely. Given that there is a commitment under this government to actually force down the unit price for TAFE programs, can you assure the committee that there will not be any corresponding drop in the quality of vocational education and training packages actually offered by TAFE colleges? How can the 84 TAFE colleges across this country undertake the training of 1.3 million Australians, on current figures, with unit cost reductions in the range of 3.8 to 7.9 per cent, according to your own advice, but probably more for other states&mdash;for instance, in the Northern Territory or in Western Australia? Will you assure the committee that there will not be any reduction in the quality of programs offered?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stated earlier, there was agreement that the individual circumstances of the states and territories would be taken into account. There are some states where the growth factor would be greater than others. There are states which have had more cutbacks than others. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what places this in the situation in which it is in. You are not dealing with a uniform situation. You are dealing with two territories and six states with different situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we cannot come up with a definite figure as to growth. That is why Dr Kemp did not say to the states, `This is the figure that you will have to meet.' That could not be done because we have to work through it with the states. That is precisely what we are doing. There is nothing unusual in that. The Commonwealth does that in a great many cases.

The report of the views of the TAFE CEOs indicated that there was a view that the current policy on training associated with employment contracts and, for example, modulisation and customisation of training to suit specific enterprises had the potential to shift the direction and balance of policy away from lifelong learning and away from appropriate integration of general education with VET.

However, we maintain our very strong reservations about the directions of the government's policy in this regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned about the impact of these changes on individual workers in terms of the impact that the new apprenticeship scheme may well have. Given the appalling condition of the preparation for the introduction of that scheme with so many of the packages yet uncredentialled and the validation processes so far from being complete, we are very concerned about the deskilling of workers as a result of the decline in the quality provided by these packages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also very concerned about the effects it has on individual workers in terms of undertaking credentials which are of a lesser value in terms of the traineeships versus the traditional apprenticeships. We notice in the growth forecasts that the government is predicating its budget on the assumption that the growth rates in the three- and four-year trainees will be next to non-existent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R273">Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997</XREF>  has two purposes. The main purpose of the bill is the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and the consequential corporatisation of Medibank Private. The other purpose of the bill is a rather minor one: to expand the role of the Health Insurance Commission to enable it to expand its range of services to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to deal with the second aspect of the legislation because the ALP is not opposed to the expansion of the role of the HIC in regard to some of those additional services that it will be able to provide in future. That aspect is of a minor nature compared with the primary purpose for which this legislation is brought before the parliament; that is, to separate out Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and to corporatise it. The ALP is strongly opposed to this action and is strongly opposed to this bill. We will be opposing the bill when it comes time for the second reading vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note that the Australian Democrats have indicated in the report produced by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that they will support this legislation. I also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7630"> understand that the government intends to move a minor amendment to the legislation relating to the period of time to be allowed for transfers of public servants between the Health Insurance Commission and the new corporatised body, and I will deal with that in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are very disappointed that the Democrats will be agreeing with the government on this occasion, because this legislation&mdash;make no doubt!&mdash;will lead to the eventual full divesting of Medibank Private from public ownership; in other words, Medibank Private will be privatised. I expect that the government will get up in due course and say, `No, that's not going to happen. All we're doing here is separating out Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and corporatising it. We will give you a guarantee that it won't be privatised in the future.' As I will demonstrate shortly, you just cannot believe them&mdash;when and if they actually say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Whilst it is clear that, at least in this initial stage, the newly corporatised Medibank Private will still be 100 per cent government owned, this is the first and the major step on the road to full privatisation. Not that much more will have to happen down the track&mdash;if this bill goes through as it appears likely to. And that will be unfortunate. It will be a great shame because Medibank Private, along with Medicare, is now enshrined in the fabric of this country as being a government owned facility that ordinary Australians can join to take out private health insurance. Indeed, Medibank Private provides an excellent level of service and leadership to the rest of the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Whilst we may not always agree that increasing the charges is necessarily something that should happen; nevertheless, there is no doubt that, on any yardstick, Medibank Private has led the way in private health insurance for a long time in this country. It has also acted as an influence on the rest of the industry in its introduction of new products and in the provision of health cover for those wishing to take out health insurance. This legislation is unnecessary. There are no good and cogent reasons for it: none were put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during the debate in the other place and none were put in the proceedings before the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medibank Private currently is the largest health insurance fund in Australia. It has approximately two million members or 27 per cent of the market. As I said, it is providing competition in the health insurance industry and it has not suffered from any restrictions under its current structure. You have to ask yourself, `Well, why change it?' As we so often hear the government say, `If it ain't broke, why fix it?' That adage certainly applies in the case of Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason for this legislation put forward by the government is that there is a perception that somehow Medibank Private gains an unfair advantage from being within the Health Insurance Commission. In the second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Abbott) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the separation, the government will ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds through its association with Medicare or other government program functions of the HIC. It reinforces the government's commitment to the principle of competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is a perception. I would suggest to this Senate that the government should think long and hard about bringing forward a bill that is based essentially on a perception. This line of argument was repeated by departmental representatives before the Senate inquiry. In its report on page 12 the committee quotes Dr Loy, appearing on behalf of the department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the government in putting forward the bill to separate Medibank Private and the Health Insurance Commission was, as has been mentioned several times during the hearing today, to address the issue of the perception and reality of competitive neutrality, first.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This perception that somehow Medibank Private derives some unfair advantage in competition with the privately run health funds was also reiterated by the representative from the Australian Health Insurance Association&mdash;that is, a representative for the other health funds. But absolutely no evidence was provided to the committee as to how 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7631"> Medibank Private gains some unfair advantage. There was no evidence whatsoever which showed there was any cross&hyphen;subsidisation that benefited Medibank Private to the disadvantage of the other private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, while the government is saying that this legislation is based upon removing a perception, removing a concern that exists amongst the other private health funds, the government representative made it clear to the committee that that was not a genuine concern at all. Dr Loy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not to say that the government accepted that there was any real cause for concern. The arrangements that were made between the government programs side of the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private were as sensible and robust as could be desired. Nonetheless, there was a perception and a reality of being able to establish Medibank Private on a competitively neutral basis with other funds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some senators may recall&mdash;and it was certainly pointed out in the report of the Senate committee&mdash;that back in 1992 this issue was addressed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when it looked at whether or not Medibank Private gained some unfair advantage. The committee found that there was no real evidence of any cross&hyphen;subsidisation. It found that the operations of Medibank Private were carried out in such a way that it was able to compete on a level playing field&mdash;to use the common terminology&mdash;with the other private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Schneider, who represented the health funds in the Senate inquiry, was at no stage ever able to say, `Look, here is a situation where our funds have been disadvantaged.' Indeed, he even went so far as to say that in the marketplace, once you separate Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission, once you move Medibank Private out of the Medicare offices and make them stand alone, it is not going to alter things very much in terms of the other private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here, first and foremost, is this government caving in to the whingeing and carping of the private health funds. They have been doing it for years. They have been complaining about Medibank Private being a government&hyphen;owned health fund. They do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like it and they have never liked it. They have been trying their hardest to get the government to dismantle it or to separate it, and to put it in a position whereby it would eventually be privatised. If they could see a way to weaken Medibank Private and thereby, hopefully, benefit themselves, then they would try.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health funds have managed to convince this government to bring in this legislation, as I said, in their own words `to fix up a perception'&mdash;to get rid of a mirage. What sort of a basis for legislation is that? That is an irresponsible approach to legislation in a very important and critical area&mdash;the area of health care and giving the opportunity to Australians who so wish to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says, `It is still going to remain in government ownership. We are not going to privatise it, so you do not need to worry about what we are doing here.' It is interesting to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in which, at the outset, Senator Knowles, who chaired the legislation committee, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that there has been some confusion over comments made about the bill being deferred. For the committee's information, the bill is only being delayed by one week in the House of Representatives to enable further consideration on tightening the provisions which would prevent any possible future privatisation of Medibank Private without necessary parliamentary approval. Any further questions on this aspect can be directed to the departmental officials later in the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chair of the committee, Senator Knowles, told the committee and the witnesses on 4 September that the government was going to amend the legislation in the House of Representatives to make it legislatively certain that Medibank Private could not be privatised in the future without parliamentary approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the witness for the union, Mr McKenna, appeared to give his evidence, he expressed the concerns that he and his members had about the potential privatisation of Medibank  Private once you got down to this stage of corporatisation and the concern that he had about potential redundancies and loss of employment. Senator Knowles got stuck into him. She harangued him. She asked him questions. She said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7632">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You talked about your concern about the possible privatisation. Are you aware of what I was saying earlier&mdash;that the bill has been delayed for one week in the House of Representatives to tighten the provisions against privatisation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr McKenna said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was not aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chair continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you also aware that Medibank Private could have been privatised under the previous government or by this government under the current legislation as it stands at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr McKenna replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I was not aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chair then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government is actually doing what has not been done in the past&mdash;that is, tightening up that loophole to prevent that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, to prevent privatisation. She went on to ask him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am interested to know, from your point of view, which party or parties you see would be the advocates of privatisation, given that it is the coalition government that is actually amending the legislation that way?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not got time to read the rest of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , but Senator Knowles, as chair of the committee, was getting stuck into the witness representing the union and saying, `You've got these unfounded fears about privatisation in the future. You are wrong, because the coalition is going to amend this legislation'&mdash;and that was why it was being delayed in the House of Representatives&mdash;`to make sure that does not happen.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what? No such amendment was ever moved in the House of Representatives. No such amendment is before this chamber. The quite vicious attack by Senator Knowles upon this witness, trying to put him in his place and suggesting to him that this coalition government was going to ensure that Medibank Private would never be privatised, her attack on a representative of the union movement who was expressing the concerns of his members, was shown to be hollow and totally erroneous. There has been no such amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why not? Having gone to all this trouble making this grandiose statement at the start of the Senate committee's hearing about what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government was going to do to ensure no privatisation in the future, when it came to the crunch, they did not do it. Senator Knowles stands condemned for the way in which she sought, in my opinion, to harangue a witness. In the end, she has been shown to be the one who got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, this legislation has been brought before this chamber to do the bidding of the private health insurance industry&mdash;that is, to remove Medibank Private from the HIC. That is something they always wanted and that I believe will ultimately be damaging to the interests of Medibank Private members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other things are going to happen as a result of this? Currently, there are 270 Medicare offices throughout Australia and, by virtue of earlier legislation and the budget process, we know that 44 of those will be closed. But the remaining 226 Medicare offices currently providing Medibank Private services are going to lose those services. Medibank Private is going to be totally separated from Medicare. In future, there will be no Medicare offices providing Medibank Private services. That will be a major change in the level of service to members of Medibank Private. Some two million people will no longer be able to access Medibank Private through their local Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen in its place? The proposal is to open 70 Medibank Private offices. There will be a reduction from 270 down to 70 of outlets providing services for Medibank Private members. No&hyphen;one in their right mind would try to argue that that is not a huge reduction in the service available to Medibank Private members. They are going to be severely disadvantaged, particularly in rural and regional areas. I am sure my colleague Senator West will take up that issue in greater detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think about the impact that this will have upon the elderly, they are not the only ones who will be affected. There are a substantial number of people who have long had the opportunity, as Medibank Private members, to visit their local Medicare office to lodge claims for Medicare and Medibank Private. In the future that service will be gone. What does this government say will replace it? It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7633"> says that people will be able to use fax machines in pharmacies or lodge claims over the telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One final matter relates to the impact of these changes upon employees, particularly the proposal that there be only a 12&hyphen;month period available to employees to elect for a transfer between the HIC and Medibank Private. That is something that we will get to when we deal with the amendments specifically in the committee stage. This legislation is totally unnecessary; it is potentially damaging to the industry and we oppose it entirely. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of concern that I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R273">Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997</XREF> . I particularly want to address how the issues, as I foresee them, will impact upon rural and regional areas of Australia, particularly those in New South Wales because that is the area I know best. We know, from answers given in estimates, of a claim that there will be no reduction in the number of staff supporting Medicare. We know that Medibank Private already contribute significant funds to the operation of the joint network of the offices. These funds will be allocated to establish a separate network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no additional allocation of funding to run two separate networks. Therefore, the networks will have to be reduced in size. The question which immediately comes to mind is: where would you reduce the networks in size? Given they have to be separate, you then have to look from a hard, economic rationalist point of view at what would be the most cost&hyphen;effective way, bearing in mind all the principles of competition and level playing fields&mdash;when you are 200 kilometres west of the Great Dividing Range, the playing field is not too level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at previous answers given at estimates to questions that we asked over 12 months ago seeking details of staffing levels within the HIC out at the shopfronts, I can tell you that Medicare offices&mdash;Medicare and Medibank Private combined&mdash;in New South Wales with fewer than three full&hyphen;time staff equivalents are Cowra, Lithgow, Parkes, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Young, Mudgee&mdash;Alice Springs popped in there for some reason or other; I am not quite sure why&mdash;Gunnedah, Inverell, Kempsey, Moree, Narrabri, Batemans Bay, Narooma, Ulladulla, Merimbula and Erskine Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go a little further to fewer than four full&hyphen;time staff equivalents, you then have Katoomba, Springwood, Ballina, Casino, Belmont, Macksville, Cessnock, Muswellbrook, Raymond Terrace, Singleton, Toronto, Wallsend, Cooma, Queanbeyan, Bega and Corrimal. From recollection, Corrimal has gone and maybe Belmont went as well in the previous change&hyphen;around. But it is interesting that all of the offices with low staff numbers, with the exception of Erskine Street, are outside the capital city of New South Wales in rural, regional and provincial places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want the department and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to tell me how they are going to separate out staff numbers like that. You cannot take a Medicare office down to fewer than two staff full-time equivalents. Not one of them has that under the previous working scenarios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see a Medibank Private office being left with one person to run it. I cannot see that the HIC will be having two offices in country towns like this. So it is quite clear that those of us in country areas are going to suffer a reduction in services. That is what this government have been all about since March of 1996&mdash;cutting things in the government areas. If they think the country is going to continue to cop this and not complain, they are very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are undertaking a multimillion&hyphen;dollar program to encourage people to take out private health insurance. And what are they doing with this legislation? The fall&hyphen;out has to be that they will be reducing the availability and access that a lot of country people will have to one of the major&mdash;in New South Wales it is the major&mdash;private health funds. It just seems to me that this is totally at odds with the logic behind the government's idea and program of encouraging people into private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons people in country areas get upset and complain is that they do not have access. If you remove the availability of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7634"> these centres, of these offices, you must reduce the number of people who take up health insurance with Medibank Private. There will be no office as there is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only assume also&mdash;and it is pretty obvious&mdash;that the Medicare offices will be going as well. We know that they are trialling easy claim&mdash;the fax machine in the corner. I know from discussions I have had in places that have easy claim&mdash;and these easy claim offices are in centres that have never had a Medicare office; they have never had the luxury of presenting a doctor's bill after it has been paid and getting money back&mdash;that people say it is great because they get their money back in four days or so, if it is a simple claim. The government are going to be asking people who have already got Medicare offices to accept a lesser service. For people in rural areas of Australia that is not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We fought hard to maintain the Medicare office in Lithgow when it was one of the ones that were originally slated for closure. But I do not know how hard we can fight to maintain a Medibank Private office and a Medicare office in Lithgow&mdash;or, for that matter, in Cowra, Parkes and Young. People in their thousands signed petitions in those communities. In less than a week in Cowra the mayor was able to get a petition of well over 1,000 signatures to present to the local member, protesting against the possible closure of the Medicare office there. Those people have not forgotten the threat that was held over them once. They have proved once that they can fight. They will have to fight again, because there is no way that the minister can tell me that this legislation is not going to lead to the closure of Medicare offices and Medicare Private access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government have some wonderful way that they are going to introduce agencies, then they should have been telling us about it, because they are not going to contribute additional funds. They say that Medibank Private already contributes significant funds to the joint network. With the withdrawal of the Medibank Private funds from the operation of the joint network, what happens to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Medicare network? They cannot and will not answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to a question that Senator Faulkner asked on 19 August, the department replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Separation of the HIC from Medibank Private will be undertaken without additional costs to the Commonwealth budget. The HIC will manage any changes in costs within its current budget allocation over the period of the forward estimates. This will necessitate managing priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expansion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and here it comes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of electronic commerce initiatives, as announced in the 1997 Budget, is a key initiative in managing existing funding. Staff are highly committed to the task of ensuring that both organisations emerge as strong and viable entities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure that the staff who are out there in the small offices do not feel quite the same way. They can see that their jobs are under threat. They know that the electronic easy claims have been introduced in areas that do not currently have access to Medicare, and they know that the same amount of funding is available to run both entities. They are not silly. They can add up&mdash;two and two makes four. In this case, when the budget is still only three, it does not equal the same number of jobs. It is a real concern to people living in country areas. As I said earlier, the government wants to increase the amount of private health insurance that we have across this country. This is not the way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another answer was given to us in the estimates hearings regarding the estimated populations serviced by a number of these offices. The Gunnedah office is estimated to serve a population of 36,857. The Lithgow office services a population of 37,118. The Young office services a population of 40,413. Cowra services an estimated population of 41,194. Armidale services an estimated population of 43,708. Moree services 4,576. Mudgee services 44,443. Bathurst services 45,616.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of population areas that will be at risk. I would not think Bathurst would be at risk because it is a much larger centre. Again, Dubbo is probably not at risk, but it services a population of 75,709; Grif 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7635"> fith, 76,923; Orange, 78,000; Tamworth, 85,000. These are the sorts of populations which are faced with significant changes and reductions in services. Let me tell you that those people do not like what is being planned for them. It is amazing: people in country areas with less access to private hospitals take out a lot of private health insurance, and they want to continue with it. It is often the elderly in those communities who try to keep their private health insurance. But, if the government makes it harder for them, it will disenchant them, it will disenfranchise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this is all about. It is all very well to say, `Oh, we want to remove the perceptions. We want to have a major advantage.' It strikes me that, given all the material that the government has been talking about and given the need to have private health insurance, the government would not want to do anything that would impact on people's ability to take out private health insurance. But that is precisely what the government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union says that the number of offices will be reduced from 270 to 70. I think it is pretty clear from the figures that I gave you previously that that is the sort of thing that logically follows. There has to be a reduction in the number of places left open because there is no way that the same amount of administration money can afford to keep open double the number of offices and employ an increased number of staff. That is what would have to happen to keep the Medicare and Medibank Private offices running with staff levels that would ensure the security and the safety of the personnel working there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some very grave concerns about this. I see this as nothing more than an attack on and a reduction in the services that are available to people in rural Australia&mdash;rural New South Wales in particular. It is typical of this government that they continue to take no cognisance of the needs of people in rural areas and reduce the level and standard of services that are available in rural areas. At the next election this government will stand condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R273">Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997</XREF>  separates Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and creates a new Medibank Private corporation. At the same time it widens the role of the Health Insurance Commission, allowing the commission to take on some new functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Democrats who referred this bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. We did that because we had some concerns about the impact on Medibank Private customers, particularly in rural areas. We also had some concerns about the impact on employees of what is, in effect, the corporatisation of Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these concerns were addressed to our satisfaction in the committee's hearings on the bill, which were conducted on 4 September. I have to say that I find the Australian Labor Party's approach to this legislation pretty extraordinary, given their record on corporatisation and privatisation when they were in government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it astonishing that they can choose to make a stand on corporatising Medibank Private, having had no qualms about selling the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the uranium stockpile, among other things. I have to say that I for one feel a lot less relaxed about selling off the uranium stockpile than I would if we had a proposal before us tonight to sell off Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that the Democrats do not support tax breaks or subsidies from the taxpayer to private health insurers. As such, we start from the premise that we are not particularly strong advocates of the government owning a private health insurance fund. We are well and truly on the record as saying we want to see Medicare become the national insurer, covering both public and private hospitals. So it would be very hypocritical of me to stand here tonight and say that I think it is a great thing for the government to be in the private health insurance business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that Medibank Private was started by the Fraser government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7636"> in 1976 to fill part of the gap left by the dismantling of Medibank&mdash;which had, of course, been set up by the Whitlam government. Once the Hawke government restored a national universal health program in the form of Medicare, Medibank Private really became a bit of an anomaly and has remained in that rather ambiguous position ever since. I do find it a bit bizarre that today the Labor opposition is defending a publicly owned enterprise set up by the coalition government when that same opposition spent most of its time in government selling off publicly owned enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, the Democrats did not make lightly the decision to support the corporatisation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. We do not care much for unnecessary corporatisations or privatisations, and we do not think much of the so&hyphen;called principle of competitive neutrality. However, we do support improved accountability in statutory bodies, and that is one of the reasons the Democrats will be supporting this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe Medibank Private enjoys a significant competitive advantage within the private health insurance industry&mdash;I think that was highlighted during the committee process&mdash;but I think it certainly does get some advantage. It obviously functions effectively where it is: as part of the Health Insurance Commission. But that does not mean that it could not function more effectively and with greater accountability&mdash;I stress that&mdash;as a separate corporation. Equally importantly, the Health Insurance Commission itself may function more effectively without having the administration of Medibank Private to worry about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we come to the core reason the Democrats are supporting this legislation. In the end, the Democrats were persuaded that both organisations are likely to benefit from the separation. I was particularly impressed by the evidence given to the committee by Dr John Loy, first assistant secretary of the health services development division of the department. Although you will find the full text of what Dr Loy said before the committee, I will just quote him briefly. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medibank Private and the Health Insurance Commission face significant challenges and opportunities and they were seen to be best addressed by being the focus of single organisations, single managements and single boards&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenges of running a private health insurance organisation business these days are clear enough . . . but it is also important to reflect on the directions that the Health Insurance Commission is likely to take over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government sees significant future directions for the Health Insurance Commission as an information, data and payments agency, in a wider way than it is now in relation to Medicare and PBS programs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will finish with this last section, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we were very concerned to see that the focus on the Health Insurance Commission as a separate business with a significant and developing role had the full attention of a single board and management.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In those committee hearings, it was Dr Loy who put the strongest case for separation of the two organisations. Mr Ken MacDougall, the managing director of Medibank Private, also put a strong case for these two bodies to be under separate management. We found that those arguments were more than reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that came up in committee hearings that was of concern to us was the needs of the staff, and I am very pleased to say that we were able to convince the government that a greater mobility period was needed. The government will be moving an amendment to take that out to 18 months. Given there was six months notice already as to what was going to happen, we are looking at a period of two years. We believe that is a reasonable time to give people the opportunity to know which body they wish to be with&mdash;whether they want to transfer back to the Health Insurance Commission if they chose to go to Medibank Private to begin with. So it is that reasonable period and not any ambit claim we will be supporting tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to say that there are many more issues in health care in this country that are far more important than this one for the opposition to get steamed up about. It is all very well for opposition sena 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7637"> tors to get up in here tonight and go on about the government caving into the private health insurance industry, but let us remember perhaps the biggest cave in ever&mdash;when the Labor Party decided to hand $1.7 billion over to the private health insurance industry. I stand here tonight and say that the Democrats, as the only ones who opposed that, have been proven right. We have had virtually no results from the handover of that vast sum of money which was agreed to by the opposition. The Labor Party, I would suggest, would be much better off making sure it never backs that sort of waste of taxpayers' money again, rather than opposing something as comparatively innocuous as this measure before us tonight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not help but see it. The good senator said that it was very good that I saw those stickers. They were stuck everywhere. They said, `Don't sell South Australia short.' It was the usual, trite Democrat sort of statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the end of the day, the Democrats fleshed it out a bit with a few TV ads, a couple of radio ads and a couple of newspaper advertisements. Those ads said that the other people&mdash;namely, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party&mdash;had sold too many things off: that during the federal Labor government a large number of things were sold off. We heard that a moment ago. We were told that a surplus amount of uranium was sold and the good senator was very concerned about that, but the fact is that a couple of million people who decided to put their private health insurance into this agency are about to be screwed up and turned upside down and have their organisation sold from under them&mdash;and sold deliberately at the behest of the rest of the competitors out there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to the government that, if they get this legislation through here&mdash;and I have no doubt they have already made that arrangement; we could see a wink and a nod between the government and the Democrats on this issue&mdash;they will probably get a pretty good price for this thing because there are a lot of people out there who want to get hold of it and screw it. They do not want to pick it up and see that there was a membership bank of two million people who, for whatever reason, put their health insurance funds into this agency. What is going to happen to it is as plain as day&mdash;a whole series of other private insurers out there will welcome this agency going to the auction block. Indeed, they will pay a good price to dismantle this organisation because they know it has been a thorn in their side for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons the Fraser government set this thing up was, dare I say it in here, to keep the bastards honest. We have all heard that before. What you find is that the people who use those sorts of arguments are the ones you have to watch.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS6">Senator QUIRKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we got over here was an explanation from the Democrats that this one did not matter but a few other things of a rather rare obscurity do. That tells you a lot more about the Democrats than it does about the major parties around here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee made the comment that the person concerned joined the Labor Party. I have to tell Senator O'Chee that I have been around for a while and I remember a lot of them making the `keeping the bastards honest' statement. It goes back a lot of years&mdash;well before the days of the previous Leader of the Australian Democrats. It goes back a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in every instance, I found that the Democrats were knocking on the same sullied doors as everyone else in political life, but somehow or other they managed to get away with that slogan for many years. In South Australia, they said they were not into privatisation. At the end of the day, they said the electors were going to vote for them and they were going to vote for them because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7638"> they were the party of purity and they would not do these sorts of things. We found out here tonight that they are capable of sinning as well, and that is what this arrangement is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, this legislation has two principal components. The first one is to invigorate and strengthen the Health Insurance Commission, which, as I understand from our shadow minister's address here, we do not have any great qualms about. We are concerned about the implications of the rest of the legislation&mdash;that is, taking Medibank Private out there and just cutting it to the quick in a whole range of different areas, reducing its availability of direct services to large numbers of Australians, particularly those in regional centres, by a dramatic reduction in shopfronts for this particular government agency. As I understand it, the figure is that it will be reduced to something in the order of 25 per cent of offices that before serviced a public out there of something like two million across the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what other senators think about this, but I must say that it seems to me that, once you start reducing the shopfront services, it is not long before people take their business elsewhere. It is not long before they make other arrangements. If you do have to go to the local chemist, if you do have to use the fax, if you do have to do all this, that and the other, it is far easier to go and join one of the other insurance providers and get your medical insurance needs fixed up there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects it is a pity that we did not see that amendment that was meant to have been run down in the lower house because then we would be much less cynical about where this is going, and we would be much less cynical about the obvious arrangements that we can see across the chamber here of a wink and a nod from the Democrats to the government. At the end of the day, I reckon this organisation will be at the auction block before not too much longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge ought to be thrown out to the government: if they are going to get up in here and tell us that this thing is not going to be sold off, that it is not going to go, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment that was foreshadowed by Senator Knowles on the committee should be proceeded with here tonight. That amendment ought to be brought down here so that everyone can see that the government is about restructuring, not about destroying and selling off this particular agency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Forshaw says, that would keep the bastards honest but, somehow or other, I do not think this is going to happen. I could be a bit cynical about it, but I do not think it is going to happen tonight. If it manages to be delayed until the committee stage sometime later this week or next week, I do not think it is going to happen then either. Somehow I do not think it is ever going to happen because I do suspect what this restructuring is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, health insurance is a very important thing for many Australians. It has to be said that the industry has had a pretty rough and rocky road for quite a number of years now. Years ago, the Fraser government established this particular agency for a very good reason. It was not only to influence the other insurance providers out there but also to set a corporate example. It was to go out there and provide services and to ensure, through active competition in the marketplace, that other insurance providers would in fact do the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all sorts of reasons and over many years it has been a very well&hyphen;supported agency. Somebody mentioned the figure here before that 27 per cent of all health insurance is actually conducted through Medibank Private. That is a very large market share. I do hope the government gets this right because restructuring is one thing. The closing of many offices, particularly in large parts of regional Australia, is in my view going to make it very difficult for that market share to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, where Medibank Private is concerned, I would suggest that the government must have a series of other stages for this. I suspect that it will be sold off before this happens. It will either be sold to some other agency that wants to come in or, as I suspect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7639"> and said earlier, it will probably be sold off to the existing industry out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue that the minister might want to raise here tonight. He might want to give us some assurances that this particular agency is not going to be sold off to some existing players so that in fact we can seek a much greater concentration in the marketplace of the other non-Medibank Private players. I would suggest that, in his address here tonight, he could go a long way to allaying some of the suspicions that are circling this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that a large number of Australians have, for whatever reason, pulled out of private health insurance over the years. The last figures that I saw in my home state showed that something in the order of 34 per cent of persons were privately insured. One of the reasons for that is that, as I understand it, an average premium for a family is somewhere in the order of $45 to $50 a week, and there aren't too many families that have that level of disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who are still in private health insurance, or whatever policies they hold and with whichever company, in many instances are reliant on the private health system in Australia. They have made the decision that that is where they want to allocate a significant part of their family income. I just hope that the government gets this right, and I hope that we really do not have ulterior motives here. If that is not the case, a lot of people who are particularly vulnerable&mdash;and we had from Senator West a list of places in rural New South Wales, and I am sure it is the same in every other state&mdash;are going to be on the receiving end of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my remarks here tonight by saying that it seems to me that this particular issue has been shrouded in a degree of secrecy. We are told that certain amendments are going to be passed, that those amendments are going to be put up and are going to strengthen the public ownership of this particular agency, but then we do not see them. Then we are told that they are not going to be necessary. Then we have the icing on the cake when the Democrats tell us that we sold 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> off too many things, so they are going to happily let the government do this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, I suspect this agency is being prepared for sale. The corporatisation of this agency is like many of the corporatisations that I have seen before in state agencies, and all they always lead in the one direction&mdash;that is, they lead to the auction block; they lead to sale.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it almost laughable that the opposition should shed crocodile tears about private health insurance when they deliberately set out to destroy the private health insurance industry. Under their direction, the private health insurance coverage in this country went down from 70 per cent of the population to only 31.9 per cent now. Nothing had changed until we introduced the changes at the end of July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reassure Senator Lees. She made the only constructive comment and asked the only constructive question during her presentation because she has a much greater understanding and knowledge than those opposite about the health insurance industry. She made the comment that private health insurance incentives had not worked. Senator Lees, it is still early; the figures will not be out for another month as to whether they have worked or not. I certainly believe that the figures will plateau because that is the experience of most countries where subsidies have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect, Senator Lees, it is a bit early to say that the incentives have not worked. They have not had time to work yet and it will be another month before we know. Experience has shown in Queensland that the figures have plateaued and that there is an irreducible figure which varies around 30 per cent. For something like nine years now 30 per cent of the population have maintained their private health insurance and I assume that the subsidy will boost that somewhat in my own state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that, there were the statements from the other side, such as Senator West's statement. Really! She was saying that the network would be reduced in size. Yet there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7640"> are already 100 additional rural Medicare facilities available as a result of the changes that we have brought in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator Forshaw, Senator Quirke and Senator West because they are locked into the politics and rhetoric of socialism.

By keeping them together we would shackle them with the constraints that government control inevitably brings about. Under the opposition's previous control, they were stuck together irretrievably and could not make separate market decisions, whereas the separation of Medibank Private will allow it to have a competitive advantage over what it has now. That is, it can approach its market and allow itself to get into situations where it can compete with the private health insurance industry. It has been the leader and it has the majority of the privately insured population in this country, but it is constrained by being intimately involved with and connected to Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>

What Dr Loy spoke about was the perception and the reality of competitive neutrality. Senator Forshaw just neglected to emphasise the reality; he talked about the perception. Dr Loy also said that Commonwealth ownership is embedded in legislation. We have been up&hyphen;front. For example, we said that we would sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra. We had that in our policy. Again I can understand the opposition saying there is some conspiracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is pleased to see that at least the government&mdash;and apparently the Democrats are supporting this amendment&mdash;has recognised the concerns that have been expressed by the employees of Medi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bank Private and the HIC. Those concerns were put to the Senate committee when it met on 4 September&mdash;that is, amongst a range of other concerns I have already referred to such as the looming privatisation, those concerns regarding the 12&hyphen;month mobility right. Apparently what has happened is that the government has recognised the merit of that argument and has accordingly proposed to extend the mobility right to 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's view is that the period should be three years, or 36 months, consistent with what is the standard within the Australian Public Service for similar situations of people moving from the Public Service to be employed by a Commonwealth owned statutory authority. Mr McKenna gave evidence to that effect before the committee, which I will read into the record, from page 8 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major concern we have in relation to the industrial aspects of the legislation is the 12&hyphen;month mobility right. There is a standard, if you like, in the Australian Public Service of three years mobility for someone who has left the Public Service to be employed by a Commonwealth owned statutory authority; they have what is called a three&hyphen;year mobility right back into the service. We cannot see any real reason why that standard does not apply in relation to the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. We would specifically point you to section 28(4) of the bill which we would seek to be changed from a 12&hyphen;month mobility right to a 36&hyphen;month mobility right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say that it is not often&mdash;in fact I cannot recall one instance to date&mdash;that this government actually listens to the arguments put by union representatives and then takes them on board and sees some merit in them, but on this occasion it has. The government has clearly recognised that the period which was specified in the bill was too short and it has proposed to extend the period to 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition believe, as I said, that the period should be 36 months. We do not think that will make any difference to what will now clearly occur with respect to the separation aspect itself, but it will certainly provide more appropriate security for the employees, who clearly will be affected by these changes&mdash;the sorts of changes that were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7642"> pointed out in your own speech, Chairman West&mdash;where Medibank Private facilities will be closed down in Medicare offices and new offices will apparently be opened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will clearly impact upon those employees in a way that is not yet really clear, but certainly one can anticipate employees' concerns about whether or not they would wish to remain within the HIC, whether or not they are able to transfer to a new corporate entity, Medibank Private Ltd, and whether or not they can, in due course, return if that is their desire. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit "18" (wherever occurring), substitute "36".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to make some further comments which again go to the legislation. We are concerned, but unfortunately this is not a matter that can be fixed by way of an amendment to the legislation, with the huge reduction in the availability of shopfront services. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) treated that rather lightly, as usual going off on one of his tangents talking about socialism and so forth. I am sure some of his National Party agrarian socialist colleagues will be concerned when there are no longer Medibank Private services in the Medicare offices in regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is in the chamber at the moment because she has made great play of what this government is endeavouring to do with the establishment of one&hyphen;stop shops: `Let us not have different government agencies such as in Social Security, DEET, CES or whatever. Let us get them all into the one location where people who need access to these various government services can do it all in the one location.' What have we got here? We have the complete reverse. The minister says that this is going to be an improvement. He says that you have to separate Medibank Private and Medicare offices somehow so they both can grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you cannot have it both ways. If ever there has been a classic example of a one&hyphen;stop shop that has existed and worked exceedingly well for years ever since Malcolm Fraser's government established it, in terms of Medibank Private and then subse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quently with the reintroduction of Medicare, it has been the co&hyphen;location of Medibank Private and Medicare, and those offices have provided other services as well such as in regard to child care and family assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that every member of Medibank Private is a client of Medicare. They have to be because every single person in the country is ultimately a client of Medicare. So two million members of Medibank Private have had the availability of a one&hyphen;stop shop with Medicare, and that is all going. I fail to see how you can argue that that will actually improve the efficiency of what, in your own words, will continue to be the delivery of services which are completely owned by the government&mdash;on the one hand, the services in the future through Medicare and, on the other hand, the services in the future with a separately corporatised Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you might care to respond to that during the committee stage because, frankly, you cannot give us all this rhetoric about bringing about efficiency in government agencies with the creation of one-stop shops, which I think is a great idea, when in this situation, for no good purpose whatsoever, you are going to remove the same thing which has been in existence for many years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing the amendments. In relation to the 18-month period, I think it should be pointed out to the honourable senator that he is basing his amendment on a false premise. The false premise is that the Health Insurance Commission is staffed under the Public Service Act and that the staff are employed under the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. In fact, Senator Forshaw is probably not aware that no part IV mobility rights will accrue to Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private staff as a result of the separation. So he has based his amendments on a false premise. As I say, I can understand that, because he probably was unaware that this was so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Commission considers the period of operation for the transfer and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7643"> retransfer provision to be fair and reasonable and provides sufficient time for the realigning of both the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private. Any longer would serve to interfere with the separation of the two entities and would unnecessarily complicate the human resource management of both entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also amused to hear the argument put forward by Senator Forshaw in relation to the overlap of Medibank Private and Medicare. Senator Forshaw was arguing in favour of the monopoly situation which exists in Medicare. Senator Forshaw cannot make that little leap, but he is arguing in favour of the monopoly situation and saying that this monopoly delivers benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, what this separation will do is allow the marketplace to enter into it, whereby both Medibank Private and the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the other insurance agencies will have to compete on an equal basis for their customers. It is called competition. I can understand that Senator Forshaw, with his union background, does not understand that. He may well understand that unions have to compete.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not misunderstand it at all. In fact, it is obvious from the minister's contribution that he really has not read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of the committee's proceedings and, if he has, he really did not understand it. First, what Mr McKenna was saying is that there is a standard within the Australian Public Service of this three years for mobility and that that is what should be applied in relation to the HIC and the new corporate entity, Medibank Private Ltd. That is not a difficult argument to follow. He is saying that, in the context of persons employed in the Public Service or by government owned instrumentalities or statutory authorities, there should be the application of this consistency, which he said was a standard of 36 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very much aware of the point you make about the application to the Public Service Act, because there was discussion before the committee about how the terms and conditions of employees who currently are employed by the HIC would be carried over if they transferred and became employees of the new corporate entity, Medibank Private. There was discussion that in some of these situations there had been issues to be negotiated between the union and the department. It was not a simple case of such things as long service leave, maternity leave and other entitlements automatically being transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, you are the one who is confused, but that is not the point. The point is that there is a general standard of 36 months, and we are saying that is what should be applied. As you said, I have been in the union movement before. I know something about competition for union membership, and I also know something about the numbers. I know that the numbers are not with us tonight. Therefore, whilst we could debate this at length, I am a realist, and I understand the Democrats will support your amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do say that, if you were prepared to listen to the arguments of the employees&mdash;it sounds like you were, because you were prepared to move the amendment&mdash;then you should have listened to them fully and gone with their proposal. I do not think it would have made much difference at the end of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7644"> day. Minister, when you respond in relation to competition, you get into this usual rhetoric. When you do not have anything really substantial to say, you just want to have a crack at the former union officials on this side. We can live with that; we can cope with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I recall prior to the last election representing the then minister at the opening of a new office that was, from memory, at Nambucca Heads in New South Wales. A new building had been built and one half of the building was the CES and DEET offices and the other part of the building was allocated to the Department of Social Security. That is a good example of where government services are co&hyphen;located, particularly where people need to utilise both services&mdash;employment assistance and social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government has come into power we have seen the introduction of the private sector into the provision of employment assistance. This government's decision has opened up what has traditionally been a CES monopoly, if you like to use those words, to the private sector through private sector employment agencies and so on. The government has already done that, but that is no argument to say that it should then not co&hyphen;locate government services that will continue to exist. The CES will continue to exist and the DSS will continue to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medibank Private is going to continue to exist in a corporatised form. We hope it continues to have the success that it has always had. We are very fearful that it is being nobbled because it is going to have a reduced number of offices available. Medicare is going to continue. Even your Prime Minister accepts that Medicare is going to continue. You are not game to implement your real policy, which would be to get rid of it. No, you are going to stick to that promise because you know the public would eat you alive if you did not. That is one promise that you are not going to break, at least at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even allowing for the fact that you are going to corporatise Medibank Private, why does there have to be this follow-on action of removing Medibank Private out of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare offices? Frankly, I have not heard a satisfactory reason yet, and I do not think there is one. As I said, at the end of the day, if Medibank Private is to remain 100 per cent government owned, albeit as a separate corporate entity, and if Medicare continues as a universal health system funded by the government through tax revenue and so on&mdash;it is a government service ultimately&mdash;then why not keep them in the one location rather than split them up? It makes a mockery of your supposed adherence to improved efficiency for government agencies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In evidence, it was also noted that there were some disadvantages to Medibank Private of co-location with Medicare. For example, customer service was constrained as Medibank Private customers had to queue with Medicare customers before being served. Mr MacDougall, General Manager, Medibank Private, also noted that Medibank Private would have more freedom to act after the separation such as expanding its distribution network through other organisations. This had not happened in the past, `but a separate entity out there will allow it to establish a primary distribution network to enable it to deliver customer service and then look at how it can expand that distribution network throughout Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the words of the General Manager of Medibank Private himself answers the query of Senator Forshaw.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope this is my final contribution&mdash;unless I provoke the minister again. Minister, I did point out in the inquiry that I had an interest to declare at the start. I am a member of Medibank Private and have been since, I think, it was formed. I have queued 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7645"> in Medicare offices and I can tell you that being on a queue for five minutes or maybe a bit longer in a Medicare office when putting in a claim for Medibank Private is not really such an onerous inconvenience that you would want to close down the Medibank Private facilities that exist currently in 270 Medicare offices around the country. Frankly, that statement is a nonsense. If the best, with all due respect, that Mr MacDougall could come up with is: `The reason for this is that people have to be on the same queue', then, frankly, he is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people who would go to a Medicare office to lodge a claim for Medibank Private would also most likely be lodging a claim at the same time for Medicare. I have done that myself many times. In most Medicare offices I have been into there is often a box into which Medibank Private claims can be dropped if the claim is one whereby the refund is to be paid by cheque via the post rather than by cash over the counter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all this stuff about queuing up, frankly, is a nonsense argument. At the end of the day, I&mdash;and I am sure members of Medibank Private and Medicare clients as well&mdash;would rather be standing in a queue for five minutes in the office they currently have than trying to find out where the nearest Medibank Private office may well be after the government shuts down 270 of them and opens up, apparently, 70 others somewhere else.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said before that the opposition was fossilised in their thinking and I repeat that. Hasn't Senator Forshaw heard of telebanking? Isn't he aware that many people now do their transactions and pay their bills by their telephone? That has been a major step forward in the technology of this country. The argument that Senator Forshaw puts is that there is no problem in just queuing up. I am sure all the people that use telebanking in this country would love to queue up because they have nothing better to do with their time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that Medibank Private work is not evenly distributed across the whole of the Medicare network. The volume of cash 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transactions and contributions collected through the branch office network is in decline due to members' preferences for alternative methods of payment such as payment of claims directly between the fund and the hospital, and employers' payroll deduction schemes. In some current locations, the volume of Medibank Private activity is minimal. Senator Forshaw wants people to queue up because they have nothing better to do with their time&mdash;so they can queue up to fill in their time. I am sure the Australian public sees through that argument, because they are voting via their telephones at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medibank Private will establish a distribution strategy that caters to all its customers. It will allow Medibank Private to enter into a new era involving these new technologies, including electronic transaction processes, putting it in better touch with the marketplace and positioning it well for the future. Let us not get locked into the rhetoric of the past and the costly service distribution costs that Medibank Private would have to stay in, because that is what Senator Forshaw is proposing. Medibank Private has to compete more rigorously with a greater commercial focus and with greater efficiency. That is what this bill is about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In researching costing of new proposals, the Department of Social Security must work within the parameters defined by privacy legislation. The broad impact of this legislation is that the Department cannot require information from customers before the purpose has been supported by legislation. Where the information is not already available, therefore, the Department prepares estimates on the best information available to it. To gain an overview picture of the situation of public housing tenants, major use was made of computer matching of addresses. The Department also drew heavily on the views of experienced staff. Some detailed data on a small group of 60 sub-tenancy cases in one geographic region was also available. This had been produced as a by-product of a review to detect principal tenants in public housing who were incorrectly receiving rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sample was not large enough to be considered representative but, as the best detailed information available, served as a useful supplement to the views of staff and the computer matching. All figures for averages have been rounded downwards. Figures cited for State Housing Authority rents represent the most common outcomes in the State involved but may not apply in all situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distribution and amounts of the rent paid by sub-tenants in the sample are broadly similar to that of rent assistance recipients as a whole. The amount of rent assistance received by these customers ranged from a low of $3.25 per week for a single unemployed customer to $49.20 per week (the maximum rate of rent assistance for a sole parent with three or more children paying more than $112.50 per week in rent). <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The average rent

The amount of additional rent for the sub-tenant required by the State Housing Authority (assuming the sub-tenant had no other income) would have been $29 for each member of a couple and between $32 and $34 for single people.

She is paying 20 per cent of her income in rent, which is $64.30 a fortnight. Living with her is her sister who is in her late 30s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second sister's income of $439.50 a fortnight is taken into account by the state housing authority, and the rent for the premises increases by $87.90 a fortnight, which is 20 per cent of her income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing arrangement, the second sister would be eligible for $12.23 a fortnight in rent assistance. This would also be the case if she were living in private rental accommodation with her sister or another person and paying the same amount of rent. Under the proposed arrangements, the second sister would not be eligible for rent assistance and the household would be $12.23 a fortnight worse off, despite the fact that the second sister is paying $87.90 a fortnight rent and

I indicated previously that we do not think this measure has quite the same far&hyphen;reaching effect and negative consequences for people on low incomes as, for example, the continuous depletion of Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement funds. However, I am still not satisfied that the government has enough information to hand about either the number of people who will be affected by the bill or the amount that the government might save from implementing this measure to enable us to allow the bill to pass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The departmental data suggests that only those tenants who are paying rent above the additional rent amount set by the state housing authorities are eligible for rent assistance and they would, therefore, be receiving the so&hyphen;called double subsidy. Evidence also suggests that the vast majority of subtenants renting in subsidised housing are actually related to the principal tenant and that they are, in all likelihood, contributing to the family income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that it is up to the principal tenant to determine how much rent will be charged to the subtenant, who can then apply for rent assistance. No doubt that is a factor of great interest to the government which, in this case, wants to save money. But we do not have any insight into the particular circumstances of those people who are supposedly receiving a double subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's office has indicated that in order to obtain the information required to determine the exact number of people who are receiving this double subsidy&mdash;to borrow the government's jargon&mdash;they must first have the legislation passed. This will effectively enable the government to sidestep existing privacy laws which currently prevent the Department of Social Security from accessing the personal information of tenants held by the state housing authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assuming that they have the legislation passed, the department can then commence the process of matching the data held by them with that currently held by the state housing authorities. As I understand it, this process is not expected to be completed before 1 January 1998, the date on which the measure is due to commence. In my opinion, this demonstrates a classic catch&hyphen;22 situation. Of course, those who ultimately stand to lose are the tenants whose income could be reduced by the measure. It seems to us the only thing that appears to be certain about any of this is that the government stands to make at least some sort of saving one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there seems to be a general lack of reliable data behind this legislation. Indeed, that was one of the motivations behind the proposal of the Democrats to have a Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7651"> inquiry into housing assistance which, as the Senate will recall, is presently under way. We cannot agree to support the passage of a bill, the effects of which are largely unknown, for no other reason than to facilitate data matching, thereby enabling the government to calculate its level of saving. On that basis, the Democrats will be supporting the ALP amendment to this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I am disappointed in the approach which they are taking. I would have thought that all of us have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer where it is proper to do so. This is a measure which will, in fact, not be saving the government money, Senator Allison; it will be saving the taxpayer money for a double subsidy going into public housing. It is  important to understand that, even where rent assistance is lost, if this measure were to pass, the household as a whole would still generally pay up to only 25 per cent of its income in rent. As you would well know from your housing inquiry, that is far less than most low&hyphen;income private renters pay in the private sector today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal's contribution that the focus has been entirely about increased rent is misleading; the total household income would be larger because there would be two tenants in the one dwelling. So while the rent may increase, so would the total household income. The household would still generally pay no more, as I said, than 25 per cent of its income in rent. Often it would be less and they would still be in a far better position than people renting in the private rental market. It is a nonsense to just overlook the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact that the taxpayer is paying twice to subsidise that accommodation. To ignore the importance of being fair to the taxpayer as well as to the tenants is, I think, a dereliction of duty by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some comment from Senator Allison about data matching. Senator, our obligation is to maintain the law. The law gives us guidelines as to data matching. That is what we are obliged to follow and of course choose to follow&mdash;to be subservient to the law. It is silly to suggest that this is in some way some devious exercise to go down a data matching trail in the future. There would be value in that data matching only if savings come from it. As I say, we all have a responsibility to protect the contributions of the taxpayer. I recognise the will of the Senate but I am very disappointed and I deplore it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the second reading of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997. This bill, which is the fourth omnibus taxation bill for 1997, covers a variety of issues which can be grouped into anti&hyphen;avoidance measures, amendments to the new simplified 1997 assessment act aligning it with the former 1936 assessment act, and a collection of other unrelated matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I start by turning to the anti&hyphen;avoidance measures. I wish to indicate that the opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7652"> tion supports these proposals in principle. However, we do have some questions about the precise impact of the proposals, and we will be seeking to have these explained by the minister or the parliamentary secretary&mdash;whoever is handling this bill in the chamber for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first anti&hyphen;avoidance measure involves tightening the thin capitalisation provisions. These provisions, which of course were introduced by Labor, limit the amount of interest deductions allowed to firms with foreign debt to ensure the integrity of the Australian company tax base. The bill is proposing change in a number of respects to the thin capitalisation regime. Specifically, the general gearing&mdash;that is, the debt equity ratio&mdash;is to be reduced from three to one to two to one for non&hyphen;financial institutions. The definition of foreign debt is to be broadened; the rules for trusts and partnerships are to be tightened; and the specific anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions are to be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated previously, we support these changes in principle. But we are concerned that the rules may have some unintended consequences for some important investments. The opposition hopes that the Senate, in its proper role of close examination of legislation, will amend the law to lower the impact on some investments in regional areas which suffer from high levels of unemployment. I  will discuss those issues in more detail during the committee stage of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second anti&hyphen;avoidance measure in the bill is aimed at stopping abuse of finance share provisions. Australian financial institutions&mdash;we do not know how many&mdash;have apparently been abusing the concessions available to so&hyphen;called eligible finance shares, EFS, and widely distributed finance shares, WDFS, by converting payments which are in effect interest into dividends in order to qualify for a tax exemption and for underlying foreign tax credits paid in other jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition strongly supports this measure and we question whether the proposal is in fact adequate, given the magnitude of the problem. The explanatory memorandum lists the savings from these proposals at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> around $130 million per year. Presumably, this rort has been costing Australian taxpayers around $130 million per year for some considerable period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators would be aware that over the last few years these financial institutions, these banks, have generally been reaping huge profits, have produced huge increases in their share value for their investors, and have massively increased the level of fees and charges levied on ordinary customers. We now find out that some of these financial institutions have apparently also been rorting the tax system to the tune of $130 million per year. This is the kind of blatant sham arrangement that should be shut down, and we will be supporting the passage of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I also ask the parliamentary secretary or the minister who is in charge of this legislation to detail to the Senate what action the Taxation Office has taken in attempting to collect this tax for the period prior to 4 February 1997. For example, has the issue been taken to the courts to see if the schemes are legally bulletproof? If so, what was the reaction of the courts? Would the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA not operate to strike down an arrangement which is merely converting income from one form to another for taxation purposes? And, if the anti-avoidance provisions do not cover arrangements like these, does this not suggest that there is a need to review and possibly strengthen these anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions? I have to say they are three very important questions which I hope the government will take note of and reply to in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our society functions because of voluntary compliance with our taxation laws. Ordinary taxpayers pay their share because they acknowledge that this is the price of a decent society, and that decent public services cost money which must be provided by taxpayers. They pay their fair share because they know that business is also supposed to pay its fair share. The schemes dealt with in this bill are examples of enormous businesses which have not been paying their fair share. Such examples tend to undermine the vital system of voluntary compliance because people think, `Why should I pay tax when I'm struggling 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7653"> to make ends meet if major transnational financial institutions can get away with rorting the system?' As I have said, Labor supports clamping down on these shonky financing schemes, but we are keen to know whether the offenders will be able to get away with the enormous tax benefits of previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final anti&hyphen;avoidance measure proposes addressing tax avoidance which has been occurring through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore. The bill proposes that the existing exemption for foreign located charitable trusts be terminated. The exemption provided to charitable trusts established in Australia is restricted. The exemption is removed for certain organisations&mdash;for example, trade unions and religious and educational bodies which do not operate principally in Australia&mdash;and the exemption for non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax is also removed for certain organisations located offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mere thought of tax exempt entities being used for tax avoidance is an unpleasant one. These are bodies which have been ostensibly set up for public benefit, be it a charity, a sporting organisation, an educational organisation, a trade union, an employer body, et cetera. In recognition of the important roles played by these bodies, this parliament has provided tax exemption for the  income of these bodies to enable their important work to be undertaken without tax penalty. It is despicable that some fancy accountants and/or lawyers have abused this system to enable tax exempt bodies to be conduits either knowingly or unwittingly for tax avoidance purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A rort is a rort, and it should be stamped out irrespective of the players involved. All that said, when fixing a problem it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that no damage is done to genuine tax exempt bodies in the process of sorting out the cheats. On this score the government has failed miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of this Senate has probably received correspondence from alarmed groups, including religious groups, sporting groups 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and educational groups, after they saw the initial draft of this legislation earlier this year. That draft legislation proposed to penalise those groups which had virtually any offshore connection or activity. The proposed penalty was not minor or trivial, but rather involved the loss of their income tax exemption. So, clearly, many legitimate bodies would have been significantly affected by the original proposals of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, because of the outcry over the original clumsy approach to addressing this problem, the government has backed down. However, there is some considerable doubt about the extent of the redrafted provision. In particular, the education and training industry is concerned about the possible effects of the redrafted legislation. For example, International Training Australia, ITA, has written to the opposition expressing their concerns about the bill that is now before us. ITA is a private company whose shareholding is comprised solely of Victorian government enterprises. It was established to combine and coordinate the training and education capabilities of the Victorian TAFE system in large&hyphen;scale overseas projects. ITA is very concerned that the provisions in this bill will impact on its members' current drive to increase the export of Australian educational services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These Australian educational institutions, for commercial reasons, often have to establish foreign subsidiaries or Australian subsidiaries which do not operate principally in Australia. These bodies are not engaged in tax avoidance but they may be caught by this legislation and hence lose their tax exempt status.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate an event which is of great importance to my constituents in western Sydney and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7654"> indeed, to the larger Sydney community. Friday, 26 September marked the commencement of active competition in a significant sporting event for the people of greater western Sydney known as the Greater West Games. For a region even now preparing for the 2000 Olympics, the Greater West Games are an invaluable precursor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The games were born of a strong team of members of the western Sydney community who pooled their numerous skills together with a sense of purpose, energy and incredible commitment to achieve this remarkable event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last year's inaugural games there was a total of 26 sports involving over 6,500 competitors. The games were an enormous success in both sporting and community terms, generating energy, expectation and anticipation. This year the organisers have achieved even bigger and better things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year's games have 50 diverse sporting competitions which cover 13 local government areas, with a conservative estimate of 13,000 expected competitors. The games range from swimming, athletics and shooting to bocce, speed skating, gymnastics and lawn bowls. There is something for everyone&mdash;I think the organisers would suggest even for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the games embrace a wealth of new sports and incorporate five state championships, including the state badminton championships, a national trampoline sports  competition and major competitions in many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the equestrian pursuers, 1997 heralded the introduction of five equestrian disciplines, bringing together both elite and up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming riders from across NSW and indeed all of Australia in prestige competitions. Events included the horse trials competition&mdash;a very important event based on the international success Australia has had in recent years with gold medals in the three&hyphen;day equestrian competition at both the Seoul and Atlanta Olympic Games. The dressage event was judged as a state championship in New South Wales, but for the younger people who wanted to participate for the spirit, the pony clubs' mounted games were also included.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisers thought of everybody, they assure me, including those who prefer to ride in a gig rather than the saddle, introducing a carriage driving competition at the historic Elizabeth Macarthur Institute. Showjumping and the grand prix and junior rider championships were also included on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Highlighting the geographically diverse region of greater western Sydney, the games incorporate a unique regatta held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. Possibly for the first time in the world, there were five sports included on the regatta program&mdash;rowing, canoeing, dragon boats, surf lifesaving and a wheelchair triathlon. It was a commendable achievement to bring all those events together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another spectacular event was the Shell lifesaving challenge, where surfboats, rubber ducks and surf skis battled for supremacy in a 20&hyphen;kilometre relay up the Parramatta River from the Harbour Bridge to Parramatta. A road cycling program was held in Parramatta Park, and a mountain bike competition was included in the games. It was identified as a good warm up for Olympic organisers, as this competition has also been included on the Sydney Olympic program. This not only offered an elite competition for our finest sports people; it gave everyone with a mountain bike the chance to ride the course and find out more about the sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young men and women of the region were involved in special school holiday junior competitions in most sports, with particular team competitions in the most popular of softball, hockey, netball and water polo. Up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming Karrie Webbs and Greg Normans played alongside pros at the junior pro-am and all golfers joined in the Greater Western Sydney Open being played in beautiful Camden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the games' objectives is to market the diverse region of greater western Sydney; another is to encourage participation. Three special events focused specifically on these dual objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families and those interested in the amazing history of the greater western Sydney region, the Hawkesbury Inheritance was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7655"> organised as a three&hyphen;day bike tour from Sydney to Brooklyn following the Hawkesbury River. More a tour than a race, the event visited a number of significant historical and tourist attractions en route, stopping overnight at Richmond and Wiseman's Ferry and providing an opportunity to see the region from a different perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great kayaking event known as the Hawkesbury Classic is another event held under the umbrella of this year's games. Almost 600 competitors started in the event, the 21st running of the 111&hyphen;kilometre overnight paddle from Windsor to Brooklyn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Described as a new and exciting event on this year's program was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> Trifecta. That is not quite what it sounds, but rather an event limited&mdash;limited, they say&mdash;to 1,600 competitors and involving one-lap dashes at Rosehill Gardens, Warwick Farm and Hawkesbury racecourses. Not only did this event traverse a significant part of the region of greater western Sydney, it was reported as a great family day and an event in which three generations participated together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the October long weekend, they held a sailing competition on scenic Chipping Norton Lakes. The regatta involved a wealth of local talent in the junior boat classes who do not often get the chance to try their very professional skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greater West Games are games for everybody. Events for athletes with a disability were included in the athletics, swimming, rowing, tennis and shooting competitions, while there were also special wheelchair competitions in triathlon and basketball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The games are only made possible by the enormous support and energy of the sponsors and supporters and the involvement of the many competitors. The chief executive of the Greater West Games, Mr Chris Cunliffe-Jones, has expressed his thanks to the former Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, for providing financial assistance under the recently launched Active Australia Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The games bring something very special to greater western Sydney and provide us with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an opportunity to showcase the many assets that our region has to offer the state and Australia as a whole. They provide us with an opportunity to do more in the way of preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cunliffe-Jones summed up the driving force behind these games by reiterating the immortal words of the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, spoken over 200 years ago:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to make a few remarks about the passing of a constituent of mine in South Australia, a dear friend named Connie Bishop. I am sure some people in this chamber would have known Connie. She was the wife of former Senator Reg Bishop, who sat in this place from 1961 until 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Reg Bishop left this place, he left an indelible mark on the Senate, as he did on the Labor movement in South Australia. Reg is still a very active member of the Labor Party in South Australia. He is now approaching his 85th birthday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, Connie passed away on 19 September. She did so from complications from a stroke she had some 18 months or so ago. For most of the last 18 months, she did not have a quality of life that could be described, in any remote sense of the word, as adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Connie was a great supporter of Reg and had her own interests as well. She actively partook of most of the spouses programs that were offered in the Senate during those years. She was a great supporter of Reg as a senator, as a secretary of the United Trades and Labour Council in South Australia and in the various other functions Reg carried out over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7656"> a very long time with the labour movement in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with much regret that I make these remarks tonight, but I think it is appropriate that we mark the passing of someone who may not have sat in this place but who, at the same time, made a great contribution to Australian political life. She did so through the work of others, principally through the work of her husband, and she was happy with that role. Indeed, for their 62 years of marriage, she was a constant source of support for Reg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the time of the stroke, unfortunately, Connie had to be housed in a nursing home situation. She was a highly dependent patient who could no longer be looked after by Reg and the family at home. Reg was a person who never forgot his wife. He was there every morning and every afternoon. I think it is appropriate to say here today that there are a number of people in South Australia who are very sad at the passing of Connie Bishop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Connie worked in her own way on a range of different things. She was a very good artist. She was a china painter. Indeed, at the funeral service there were a number of people who came from the various walks of Connie's life to pay tribute to Connie and to her passing. The Hawker ladies were there. The Hawker ladies are a famous institution in South Australia from the now defunct federal electorate of Hawker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years these particular women raised large amounts of money for the various candidates and for the members. The member for Hawker, of course, for many years was  Ralph Jacobi and then Liz Harvey. We had some candidates in the field before the seat was abolished, I think, for the 1993 election. At the funeral service, these people were there as well paying their last respects to Connie.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predictive DNA testing is now a reality for many people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee may choose to be very glib about this issue, but it is actually a very serious one. The issues are probably best illustrated by a number of examples, but the one I shall use is the example of the hunt for the breast cancer gene called BRCA1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1986, Kay Dickersin and her three sisters submitted themselves to DNA testing in Mary-Claire King's laboratory in Los Angeles. Through analysis of the sisters' DNA, the laboratory and other collaborating laboratories identified a region of DNA which carried the undiscovered BRCA1 gene. This achievement was lauded in the media, resulting in considerable celebrity status for the researchers. That is, the possibility of identifying a gene through a simple blood test that causes cancer promised a readily available `molecular mammogram'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, the gene has been cloned and the predictive DNA test is available. This test identifies the nature of a specific gene in an individual, and that is among the most personal of information for that particular person. The issue for the community is, of course, how to ensure that this test and others like it are applied so that the basic privacy of individuals is adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scientific approach of dissecting large problems into small sections is a powerful approach to problem solving. Without this approach, the present genetic technology may not have been discovered or developed. However, this approach does not incorporate limits to discovery, provide an insight into the long&hyphen;term consequences of those discoveries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7657"> or place biological causes in their environmental and social contexts. That, of course, is our task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a negative assessment, or not meant to be a negative assessment, of the possibilities of genetic technology as many of the modern achievements in medicine have been assisted by technological developments. For example, the ability to control women's fertility remains a significant milestone. However, there is a need for debate about what we want and what we expect from genetic technology as the latest revolutionary technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has almost been presented in science fiction terms with the overuse of superlatives and many grand ideas promising complete and specific cures. I certainly hope that genetic technology has not been used as a grand scam, if you like, to generate wealth and laurels for a select few at the expense of other more relevant and achievable research directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Mary-Claire King has estimated that a woman carrying the BRCA1 gene will have an 83 per cent chance of getting breast cancer by the time she reaches the age of 70. This means the ability to detect the gene is merely an early detection mechanism and only adds to the range of other early detection mechanisms already available, such as X-ray mammograms. This one may be easier to administer, with fewer side effects and have a greater accuracy, but it is not a cure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These statistics also mean that there are a cohort of carriers of the BRCA1 gene who will not develop breast cancer. Added to this  statistical `chance', there are also a cohort who do not carry the BRCA1 gene and who will develop breast cancer. The causes for these other breast cancers include other genes, such as the p53, and other unexplained `sporadic' breast cancers which have no hereditary components. Once the predictive testing has been carried out and a patient has been identified as carrying the gene, the choices available to that patient remain the same. So predictive testing does nothing for treatment and prevention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Kay Dickersin's case she had three sisters, two of whom also developed breast cancer at the age of 38. With three of the four sisters developing breast cancer before menopause and the youngest sister aged 35 and free of breast cancer, this represented, if you like, a pretty good bet for an inherited breast cancer gene. If a predictive test had been available at that time, the issue for the family could have been whether or not to determine which family members carried the BRCA1 gene and whether or not other family members should be tested or offered the test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This illustrates my central concern about this issue&mdash;that is, how should the personal genetic information be collected, stored, collated and disclosed? The information of the older sisters was that they had the BRCA1 gene. This was their information, which was directly relevant to their lives. However, that information was also directly relevant to their youngest sister. She shares genes with her sisters and it was very likely she would have the same BRCA1 gene. But is her sisters' genetic information also her information? What entitlements does she have to that information? Does she have a right to know, for example, that her siblings or relatives carry specific genes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there are complex ethical issues associated with the use of test results once they have been obtained and I cannot actually provide an easy answer to the parliament. But this is an important issue that the parliament should be considering and one that has been highlighted by a recent High Court decision, Breen v. Williams. This case does confirm that patients do not have the right of access to inspect or copy their medical records. These are the records that would, in the majority of cases, list the results of predictive tests and the way those tests are carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally I would favour a national and enforceable privacy scheme which applied to predictive testing, with provisions which are enforceable. This, of course, reflects the Democrats' opinion regarding privacy laws generally and, in particular, privacy laws that cover the private sector. I have introduced a private member's bill in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A privacy scheme directed to predictive testing would need to address, at least, the following matters: a definition of `personal information' which includes genetic test information that may affect or identify another, such as sisters sharing a gene for cancer; the circumstances in which a person may be denied access to their test results, for example, where there may be medical reasons; what controls there should be to ensure that a breach of confidence does not occur, for example, how test materials and results are stored; what complaint, dispute and dispute resolution mechanisms there should be in the event of breaches of confidence, and use or disclosure of test material and results; how test results should be disclosed in cases of adoption, unwanted pregnancy, fostering, et cetera, situations; how long the test laboratory should retain test materials and results, and provide access to those materials and results; and, finally, the test result information disclosed by the test laboratory for purposes other than diagnosis, even with the consent of the patient, for example for research purposes. I also place on record the relationship between privacy and a range of other information issues. Of course, I have spoken at length many times about the information society and its need for privacy infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would like briefly to address a related issue which deals with access to information in the form of patents. The case of Moore v. Regents of the University of California concerns the ownership of biological materials. John Moore was diagnosed to have hairy cell leukaemia and sought help from Dr David Golde at the UCLA Medical Centre. John's cancerous spleen was removed and Dr Golde and his laboratory cultured cells from the  tumour. They discovered unusual proteins in a cell line and they filed a patent. The matter resulted in a dispute, when Dr Golde attempted to get John to sign away his rights, which ended up in court. The court eventually decided that Dr Golde should have revealed his research to John, but it granted the property rights of the cell line for a limited period to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this decision was to say that John did not own his own bodily material. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not think that seems to be a satisfactory result. By extension it means that bodily material such as blood and DNA used in predictive DNA testing becomes the property of the tester. This is unfair and I believe it should be reviewed, as a patient with their unique biology should not be removed to the status of an interesting source of wealth and their body and its materials should not be owned by another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have addressed a part of my concerns about this issue in a private member's bill which is before the parliament. That bill specifically excludes the patenting of genes and gene sequences. But I suggest a future assessment may need to go further and examine patenting of cell lines and a number of other biological materials, as well as the privacy issues raised by predictive testing. The personal information contained in the DNA also needs to be adequately protected.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7658"><TITLE>Professor Douglas Whalan</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such is the nature of our work that sometimes we think that we in this place or those in the other place are great people. But the true measure of greatness is the legacy one leaves after one dies. I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time tonight to speak of a legacy which will endure from a truly great man, the late Professor Douglas Whalan, who was the legal adviser to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for some 15 years. Professor Whalan passed away quite recently after a struggle to overcome cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You, Madam President, will know how brave Professor Whalan was in that struggle as you were kind enough to host a dinner in his honour when we last sat. Indeed, it will come as a shock to many senators that Professor Whalan has passed away so quickly. Fortunately, he was able to maintain his great sense of humour at all times and also his graciousness. I think you will have been touched, as I was, Madam President, by Professor Whalan's being immensely tired at the dinner that we attended but not wanting to leave while other people were telling 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7659"> stories and having a good time. I think that is a mark of a great and truly gracious man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was moved to look up Professor Whalan's entry in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's Who</EMPHASIS>. I know that this entry is not a complete entry because there are things that I know he has done which are not listed here. But it is interesting to note that from humble beginnings in New Zealand&mdash;and I always used to say to Professor Whalan, `That is a very humble beginning'&mdash;he achieved greatness not only in New Zealand, not only in Australia, but in Papua New Guinea and Canada as well where he made substantial contributions to the legal system in those countries. In his time he was Professor of Law at the University of Queensland and Professor of Law at the ANU. He was a member of the Australasian Law Schools Association and a member of the Alberta Institute for Law Research and Reform. He was, in fact, an organiser of the International Law Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also a noted civil libertarian, but a man who was a civil libertarian not out of some ideological drive but out of a sense of decency. I think what drove Professor Whalan in his search for the maintenance of civil liberties was the sense that this was the decent thing to do for one's fellow citizens. He was also a great supporter of Aboriginal people. He was, in fact, the foundation chairman of the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service of Queensland in 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, it may surprise you and others to know that in his time as legal adviser to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances Professor Whalan scrutinised over 18,000 items of delegated legislation. Those who have had the good fortune and honour to serve on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and  Ordinances will know that Professor Whalan not only had a meticulous eye for errors but also had a humorous way of expressing his point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think of some of the incredible detail which Professor Whalan could find in a set of regulations. For example, I remember several years ago Professor Whalan finding that the penalty for parking illegally outside the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> National Maritime Museum was $200 while knowing the penalty for parking on the other side of the street, which was not covered by federal government regulation, was in fact $10. He insisted that this was a matter of great concern and importance to the rights and liberties of individuals, and he was absolutely correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of Professor Whalan's proudest achievements on the committee would undoubtedly have been rectifying an anomaly in the regulations that related to unpaid accrued holiday leave for public servants. I remember the great tenacity with which Professor Whalan led us in the fight to rectify the anomaly and the satisfaction he had in knowing that members of the public who had served in the Public Service, many of them some 30 years ago, wrote in saying, `Thank you very much for ensuring that I was paid all of the holiday entitlement that I should have been paid when I retired.' Some people said, `I have been retired for 20, or 30, years and this has made an improvement to my standard of living and has also meant that I finally feel that I have been appreciated and dealt with fairly, honourably and properly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the basis of Professor Whalan's zeal and his contribution to this committee. There are many members of the committee, past and present, who were touched by his little kindnesses. I know that those who travelled with Professor Whalan to the inaugural conference of Commonwealth legislative scrutiny committees in 1989 would say that, because of Professor Whalan's kindness, it was perhaps the finest overseas trip they had ever undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was fortunate to go on a trip with Professor Whalan to New Zealand this year. I thought it was wonderful and incredible the way in which Professor Whalan was held in high regard, not just by Australian scrutiny committee members but also how those of other countries&mdash;for example, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and places in Africa&mdash;looked up to his erudition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also feel that I have lost a friend. Professor Whalan was not only a fine mind but also a great sportsman. He and I on many occa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7660"> sions had wonderful conversations about the changes in training techniques between his day and today and the sorts of things that he used to do as an international triple jump competitor&mdash;or should we say hop, skip and jump competitor, as I think it was in his day. He had a freshness and enthusiasm for life that was undoubtedly contagious. Everybody who knew him loved him and admired him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also brought a strange passion to life. Some of his hobbies included bee&hyphen;keeping, horses and growing exotic fruit. There is one fruit that Professor Whalan has grown which will continue to flourish&mdash;that is, a lust to protect the rights of individuals. I know that this Senate committee, although it has been forced to replace Professor Whalan, will use him as an inspiration for what it does in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity in closing to say that I will be giving notice tomorrow of a general business notice of motion which I will be seeking formality for on Wednesday. As I said, we sometimes think that we are great during the course of our life, but the true measure of greatness is the legacy we leave behind. Professor Whalan leaves behind a legacy for which many untold thousands of Australians will be grateful for many years to come.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7660"><TITLE>Australian Anthem</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, there has been an increase of 8. This occurred as a result of the usual allocation round and reflects needs based planning guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) The National Health Act 1953 does not "licence" beds, rather it allows the Minister to approve a certain number of places. When an eligible resident is being provided with nursing home care in an approved place, subsidy is paid according to that resident's assessed level of care need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) There is no fixed commercial value attached to an approved place. The transfer of places by sale between approved providers is accorded a value by the parties, not by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) The availability of additional places is determined and gazetted annually by the Minister for Family Services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) No, there is no provision for direct transfer under the National Health Act 1953. Nevertheless the revocation of the approval of Derwent Court Nursing Home was the basis for the approval of additional places at Rosary Gardens Nursing Home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) Following the recommendation of the Standards Review Panel of Tasmania in December 1996 that Derwent Court Nursing Home be closed without delay an information gathering process was undertaken. That process included:</PARA>

Issues identified included lack of dignity and privacy, failure to maintain mobility and dexterity, very poor continence and pain management practices as well as broader problems relating to fire safety and the general physical environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) Discussions were held with residents and their families during each of the assessments of standards carried out in March and May 1997, and provided an important part of the findings that the standards were not satisfied. The National Health Act 1953 makes it a condition of approval that a nursing home satisfy the Commonwealth standards. When a facility does not, a decision must be made the Minister or delegate about what action is justified in the circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Franchising Code Council Ltd appointed an Administrator (FCC, formerly Franchising Code Administration Council (FCAC)), on 30 January 1997. No member of the company had been appointed by any Minister at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 December 1996 the company decided to cease trading on 31 December 1996, and to hold an Extraordinary General meeting on 30 January 1997. As was the case above, no member of the company had been appointed by any Minister at that time. This reflects the Government's expectation that members would have been elected in accordance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding this, on 31 December 1996, when the FCC had ceased trading, I understand that Mr Michael Delaney was a member of the company. Mr Delaney was one of the core members of the FCAC when it was established, and was appointed for a period of two years by the then Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Government appointed the initial core members of the Franchising Code Administration Council (FCAC) in 1992. The then Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, the Hon David Beddall MP, wrote to a range of persons inviting them to be members of the initial core group of members of the FCAC on 22 September 1992. These initial core members were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chairman:Mr Robert Fitzgerald</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representing Franchisors:Mr Stephen Penfold; Mr Stephen Jermyn</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Banking Representative: Mr Kevin Guttridge</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Representative: Mr Michael Ahrens (Baker, McKenzie Solicitors)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except for Messrs Penfold and Ahrens, each was a member of the Franchising Task Force that produced the report, Franchising Task Force: Final Report (December 1991), that recommended the establishment of the Franchising Code Administration Council (FCAC) to administer the voluntary code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Tim Garrard, then the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, was the Government representative on the initial FCAC. The position of Government representative was as a non&hyphen;voting observer only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letters inviting the above industry persons to become core members of the FCAC stated that part of their responsibilities would be to</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the core members were appointed, arrangements were established for the remaining members of the FCAC to be appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining members of the initial FCAC were appointed on the basis of advice provided by the initial core group. For example, one advice to the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The core Council membership sought nominations from the petroleum retailing and new motor vehicle retailing industries in order to ensure that both industries became familiar with the aims and objectives of the Council and to help allay any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7669"> concerns these industries may otherwise had with the Code. In addition, the very size of both industries, in terms of both turnover and employment, also suggested that both should have representation on the Council. Consequently, Mr Thilo Troschke, National Corporate Affairs and Administration Manager of Honda Motor Vehicles, was nominated by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, and Mr Stuart James, National Reseller Manager of Shell Australia, was nominated by the Australian Institute of Petroleum."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Half of the initial members of the Council were appointed for one year, with the other half being appointed for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members were thereafter elected by the Council for a two year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">FCAC members were allowed to serve a maximum of two terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any representatives of franchisors, franchisees and service providers and advisers were able to nominate and stand for election to the FCAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">New FCAC members were elected by the remaining and outgoing FCAC members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) As noted in question one, the Government did appoint the initial core members of the Franchise Code Administration Council (FCAC). The remaining members of the initial FCAC were appointed on the basis of advice provided by the initial core group of members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FCC was an independent company. As half the members were appointed for two years and half for one year, it was the Government's expectation that elections would have occurred in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association and members appointed accordingly. Consequently, after the second year, the Government had no role in the selection and appointment of members of Franchising Code Council Ltd (FCC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In 1992, the then Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, the Hon David Beddall MP, wrote to various persons, inviting them to be members of the initial core group of the FCAC. In those letters, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Presently, I am establishing the Franchising Code Administration Council to administer the operations of the Code."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Copies of the letters are at Attachment A.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Mr Robert Fitzgerald, who accepted the position as Chair of the FCAC in a letter dated 22 October 1992, wrote to the Deputy Government Solicitor on 26 November 1992, asking him to proceed with the incorporation of the FCAC on the basis of a range of specifications set out in his letter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of this information, the Australian Government Solicitor formulated the Memorandum and Articles of Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter from Mr Fitzgerald to the Deputy Government Solicitor and paragraph 1.6 of page 148 of Franchising Task Force Final Report are set provided in Attachment B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very similar letter was sent, on 2 December 1992, by the then Assistant Secretary of the Services Industries Branch of the then Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. A copy of this letter is at Attachment C.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The establishment of the FCAC was recommended by the industry&hyphen;led Task Force in recommendation 9 of Franchising Task Force: Final Report. The establishment of the FCAC was the culmination of a significant amount of work undertaken primarily by representatives of the industry. A response to an additional question asked by the Senator on 12 August 1997 indicated that this Government did not "set up" the company. However, in 1992, the then Government did play a key role in the establishment of the company, particularly in bringing the parties together to identify and seek solutions to the problems faced by the franchising industry, and facilitating the establishment of the Franchising Code Administration Council, including development of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company, appointment of the members of the company (for periods of up to two years) and provision of seed funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the industry and the then Government recognised that franchising was a large, fast growing and important sector in the economy. The industry had identified constraints to the growth of franchising, which included costly legal disputes between franchisees and franchisors, the threat of legislation and damage done to the reputation of franchising from the existence of a small minority of disreputable franchisors and franchise consultants in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Task Force was established to recommend solutions to the problems impeding the growth of the franchise sector. The Terms of Reference asked the Task Force to examine and propose mechanisms for the reduction of barriers and impediments to the efficiency and growth of the franchising sector.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7670"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force was industry led and comprised a small expert group formed from representatives of franchisors, franchisees, the banking sector and academics. Mr Robert Fitzgerald was the Chair of the Task Force. The deputy chair position was held by the then Assistant Secretary of the Service Industries Branch of the then Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC). The decision to establish an industry led Task Force recognised that the commitment of the people in the franchising industry was critical for the industry to be reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force sought solutions that would avoid the situation that had developed in the United States, where the franchise sector was characterised by excessive regulation, exorbitant start&hyphen;up costs and costly litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force received submissions from a wide cross section of the industry including franchisors, franchisees, associations, lawyers, accountants, consultants, bankers, small business organisations and government instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Task Force has walked a delicate line in seeking to protect the interests of all participants in the franchising sector, whilst creating an environment that should enhance the growth and efficiency of the franchising industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To this end, the Task Force, having carefully examined various options, has determined that a self&hyphen;regulatory Code of Practice administered and maintained by a Council of representatives from all areas of the franchising sector to be the most appropriate response." (Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991), p.vi)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6 of the Task Force was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Task Force recommends a self&hyphen;regulatory Code of Practice be developed which will cover Franchisors, Franchisees, Advisers and specified Service Providers as defined in the Code." (Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991), p.xiii)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9 of the Task Force included the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Task Force recommends the following administrative arrangements for the Code of Practice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a. The Minister for Small Business, in consultation with the Council of Small Business Ministers, should establish a Franchising Code Administration Council ("the Council").</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">b. The Council should comprise representatives of Franchisors, Franchisees, Advisers, Associations, Service Providers and at least one government representative. The Council should comprise between 9 and 11 members. . . " (Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991), p.xv) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the Task Force has developed its conclusions and recommendations based on a thorough analysis of submissions presented and of the studies undertaken." (Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991), p.vii)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As can be seen from the above, the industry led Task Force recommended that the FCAC be established to administer the self&hyphen;regulatory code, on the basis of numerous submissions from industry and Government. It also formulated the initial draft code of practice, which was included in the Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991) at pages 148 to 170.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government facilitated the establishment of the FCAC by providing the technical services of the Deputy Government Solicitor to draft the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the FCAC in accordance with the specifications set out in the 26 November 1992 letter of the Chair of the FCAC, Mr Robert Fitzgerald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once established, the FCAC consulted widely with the industry and government before finalising the code of practice. The FCAC then administered and maintained the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government played a supporting role in the implementation of the recommendations of the industry&hyphen;led Task Force to establish the FCAC. The Government provided seed funding for: the establishment of the Franchising Code Administration Council (FCAC); further development of a code of conduct; and the design and implementation of an appropriate accreditation/registration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding was initially for a two year trial period. One of the objectives of the trial was the attainment of cost recovery for the code's administration by the end of the period. At that time, it was envisaged that Government involvement in the administration of the scheme would be minimal thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Government's primary roles in the establishment of the FCAC were to bring the parties together to address the problems facing the industry, through the establishment of the Task Force, and, following consideration of the Report, to facilitate the establishment of the FCAC, including developing the Memorandum and Articles of Association and providing seed funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The reporting and other responsibilities to the Minister responsible, in the Memorandum and Articles of Association, broadly reflect the advice of the Chair of the FCAC to the Deputy Government Solicitor, which, in turn, broadly reflect the pertinent sub&hyphen;clauses in clause 1.6 of the Draft Code of Practice set out in Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991). 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7671"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chair of the FCAC wrote to the Deputy Government Solicitor on 26 November asking him to draft the Memorandum and Articles of Association according to a range of specifications, including the purpose of the company as set out in section 1.6 of the Draft Code of Practice in Franchising Task Force Final Report (December 1991).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In section 1.6 of the Draft Code of Practice, the industry led Task Force suggested the responsibility the Council would have to the Government. The relevant sub&hyphen;clauses of clause 1.6 are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under its Act the Library exists to provide services to all the people of Australia. We are charged with ensuring that documentary resources of national significance relating to Australia and Australians are collected, preserved, identifiable and accessible to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over recent years as stated within our Strategic Plan 1993&hyphen;98, we have given priority to activities which maximise nationwide access to and awareness of our collections and activities in line with our goal to be the world's leading documentary resource for learning about Australia and Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmanians as with other Australians, benefit from these activities. For example since we launched our World Wide Web site in March 1995, use has increased throughout Australia from 2,190 files accessed daily to a May 1997 increase of 19,500 files daily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we do not record individual State figures for Internet use, the fact that we provide approx 2,000 requests per month for Tasmania from our document delivery/interlibrary loan service; that there are 38 Tasmanian participants to our national Australian Bibliographic Network; and that we have 169 Tasmanian addressees on our regular mailing lists to receive information, indicates the level of interest from that State to our services (The mailing list includes a range of state departments, community organisations, libraries, art galleries, schools, museums as well as The Launceston Examiner and Hobart Mercury).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) What was the level of funding provided through grants for 1994&hyphen;1997?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only grants provided by the Library are the Community Heritage Grants. This program helps preserve documents of Australia's past that are held in community collections. Offered for the first time in 1994, the program provides financial support of up to $5,000 for preservation projects undertaken by local historical societies, libraries and other community organisations that hold collections of documents. Grants are made to assist in the preservation of material which is of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Initiatives and Collaboration Branch within the Library has funded the following organisations in Tasmania through its Community Heritage Grants program from 1994&hyphen;1996. The award for 1997 has yet to be announced.</PARA>
