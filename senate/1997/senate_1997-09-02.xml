<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Can the minister tell the Australian people whether the Prime Minister still believes that the Fairfax journalists are `out of control'. Is it not a fact that the Fairfax journalists are more in control than the Prime Minister's communications minister, Senator Alston&mdash;better known as doormat&mdash;given Senator Alston's total failure to persuade the coalition's backbench committee of the political benefits of cross&hyphen;media ownership changes? Will the Prime Minister apologise to the board of Fairfax for the various destabilising and undermining comments he has made about their performance, now that he is `comfortable and relaxed' about Fairfax?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Prime Minister has said is that there are other matters of higher priority before the government. I would have thought that Labor would agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I found fascinating was what Mr Gareth Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, said today. He said the media was `sufficiently concentrated'. That is as a result of Labor's policies and is not surprising. Just let us look for a short while at Labor's record on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who allowed the takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, which resulted in one company owning nearly 70 per cent of newspapers in Australia? Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Who allowed TV audience reach rules to be expanded from 43 per cent to 75 per cent? Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Who allowed the number of regional TV stations to shrink dramatically? The Labor Party&mdash;Mr Hawke and Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, do you remember what Senator Button was reported to have said? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> You do, Senator Schacht, do you? Of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, on media policy at cabinet, Senator Button said, `Tell us'&mdash;the cabinet&mdash;`what your mates want?' That is the way the Labor Party ran media policy in this country: `Tell us what your mates want, and we will deliver, and the result will be greater concentration'&mdash;as was demonstrated by what Mr Evans said.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole record of Labor was one of intervening in media policy for Labor's mates. And the result of that&mdash;the bottom line&mdash;was greater concentration in the Australian media. So what right has Senator Schacht got to come into this place and complain of others? We were interested in sound policy but decided that there were other matters of higher priority. That should be something that Labor applauds not condemns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on with all the quotes from Mr Keating. Do you remember what Max Suich said on Labor's record in relation to media intervention? Do you remember Mr Keating's threat to Black? He said, `If there is any notion that you show bias'&mdash;that is, that you barrack for the coalition&mdash;`then there is no way you would qualify to be the kind of owner we would like.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was Mr Keating. That was Labor's record in relation to media policy. The Labor Party has no record to stand on, and that was confirmed today by Mr Evans. My advice, Senator Schacht, on the basis of your record would be: let the coalition get on with the important issues facing this nation, the issues of helping small business to grow and employ and of giving back more to families, as we did with our tax policies. That will be something to be recognised and applauded by all Australians.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the Prime Minister has wasted 14 months trying to change the policy and has now adopted a position that is the Labor Party policy on media from the previous government&mdash;so they are not changing anything&mdash;and given that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6162"> Prime Minister now totally runs communications policy, is he giving thought to taking over ministerial responsibility for the Department of Communications and the Arts and reappointing his current minister to a less arduous portfolio such as tourism, which is an area the minister has focused on extensively since his appointment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody is saying that there is a policy that cannot be improved; it can be improved. Most of Labor's policies can be improved. What the coalition is saying is that there are major issues on the agenda&mdash;taxation policy, for example. There are priorities that can result in a reduction of income tax&mdash;to the benefit of all Australians. As I said in answer to the primary question, the fact that the government would choose to concentrate on the priorities that are of greatest importance to the Australian people is something that ought to be applauded rather than condemned.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BX5">Senator GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, the Keating government over four years increased taxes by 30 per cent, borrowed an additional $70 billion, sold off $9 billion worth of assets, spent the lot of that, then left us with a $10 billion deficit. Minister, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the ACTU have suggested that government expenditure should be massively increased. What would be the impact of this on the economy?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6162" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Gibson, for the important question. We have seen some very clear statements in recent days from the Democrats, the Labor Party and the ACTU. They can be summed up in the sense that the Labor Party have learned nothing from their 13 years in government and neither, it seems, have the Democrats or the ACTU. The sorts of policies that the Democrats, the Labor Party and the ACTU are promoting are big spending policies which, as we know, lead to high deficits, high taxes and high debts, and do not create real jobs. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, you may be aware that the Democrats released a paper entitled `Res 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> toring Confidence', which I suggest would be better titled `A Confidence Trick'. This paper proposes a massive $2.5 billion fiscal stimulus, the majority of which would be through higher spending. This higher spending was quickly endorsed by the embattled shadow Treasurer and Mr Kim Beazley. And the ACTU, back to their old tricks, showing just how out of touch they are, called for even more spending. As the Treasurer said, they are like bees to a honey pot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, let me make a couple of points clear which hopefully will throw these claims for higher spending into some perspective. First, if big deficit spending created real jobs, Labor would have licked the unemployment problem&mdash;which they did not. Of course, they spent up big, and unemployment got worse.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can get some clues as to what some of these groups hope to achieve through the release of the paper by the Democrats. It works off a false premise that we have a flat economy, with poor growth prospects. The GDP growth is forecast to accelerate this year to 3&frac14; per cent, building on the step up of growth in the first half of 1997. Inflation is continuing to be low, and unemployment is expected to fall. Of course, this view is generally endorsed by private sector forecasts.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that Senator Faulkner had the courage to ask this question. I can well understand why Senator Schacht was once again wanting to hide from it. I would not normally go into detail of this nature, but I will say for Senator Faulkner's benefit that the decision was taken yesterday by cabinet. Let me do even better and tell you why cabinet took the decision. They took it because they well understood that the Australian public was interested in the real issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, we were not going to play the distraction game. We were not going to fall for the sort of nonsense that we have been seeing on the other side of the chamber. What we have seen in recent months on this issue is the Labor Party, through Senator Schacht, saying, `We'll refer any legislation that comes up to a Senate committee. We'll have a full inquiry but, despite that, we are going to oppose it. We are not going to countenance any change in the rules, irrespective of the merits.' This was said by Mr Beazley, Mr Evans and Senator Schacht. In other words, they wanted to have their negative little piece of cake and eat it. What they wanted to do&mdash;and Senator Schacht was no doubt salivating at the prospect&mdash;was have a wall to wall, all star celebrity cast so Senator Schacht could have his 15 minutes of fame before a Senate committee; so he could be basking in the glory of pontificating, hectoring, lecturing and telling all these media moguls how the world ought to operate according to him. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that that would have done was give Senator Schacht one last chance. The trouble is that Senator Schacht blew it last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked about meeting with the Murdochs, and that is very relevant. You know what happened last week? Senator Schacht could not be bothered coming into question time because he went to see Lachlan Murdoch. What he did was have a confidential conversation. How long did it remain confidential? Only as long as it took Senator Schacht to blurt out all the confidential details all over page three of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. You have blown it. They will not talk to you again. They will not take your calls. They are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sick to death of it. You cannot behave in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were not going to allow you to have that sort of ridiculous charade or play those sorts of games. The extraordinary thing is that Senator Schacht, after putting out of all sorts of irrelevant press releases, put out another one yesterday saying, `This government has no policy process other than the delivery of deals to a particular media proprietor to curry political favour.' If ever there was an outfit that turned private deals into an art form, it has to be this crowd. What we have is the absolute chutzpah of getting up and basically saying what you saw when you looked into the mirror: `We were the ones who specialised in this and we're outraged because we think you might be doing the same thing.' The fact is that we were not, and Senator Kernot said as much this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be absolutely clear: we were not going to play this little game. We want to concentrate on jobs. We know what the public are interested in. The public are not interested in seeing you grandstanding. They do not want to see legislation bogged down for months by people who have no interest in the main game.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well may senators opposite laugh. The fact is that, as a result of the Workplace Relations Act, the unions are required to provide statistics and information that demonstrate the level of membership. What do the latest figures show? They show that over the last two years the 20 biggest unions have suffered a net membership decline of over 86,000 members. This is truly appalling, because this crowd actually spent millions of dollars on a membership drive committed to increasing membership levels by over 200,000 by 30 June this year. In football parlance, that is almost a 300,000 turnaround and you cannot have a worse vote of no confidence than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very serious issue for the country and quite clearly we will obviously have to take advice from a wide range of areas. The declining significance of the union movement makes it much more difficult of course to get any sensible idea of what the various unions think. I would have to say that I think the New South Wales approach has been consistently a much more sensible one than that&mdash;to engage in constructive dialogue, to encourage the workers, to boost their levels of productivity and to cooperate with employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But no. What do we find? Once again they have their head in the sand. Yesterday Bill Kelty briefly addressed the congress and, instead of getting up there and giving a decent apology, what did he do? He tried to change the subject. He said, `We have a new strategy. We are going to concentrate on the regions.' I do not know whether he read our regional arts policy, but quite clearly this is not what the membership wanted to hear. They wanted to know why all those millions of dollars have been absolutely down the drain and why the membership&mdash;the rank and file&mdash;have been voting with their Nikes. They are not just walking away; they are running away in droves and they are doing it because

This resulted in a draft proposal&mdash;a plan for the future management of Australian airspace, Airspace 2000&mdash;which was released for industry comment in August 1996.

Will you advise the Senate what progress was made at that meeting and the implications for Australia?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Troeth very much for that question. It is obvious from the catcalls made by the Labor Party opposite that they really are not interested in the Asia-Pacific region. The second energy ministers meeting was held in Edmonton, and it was made up of the 18 economies in the Asia-Pacific region. There is little doubt that the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be a driver of economic growth as the region's population continues to expand into the next century. Economic growth in APEC is forecast to grow at an average of 3.3 per cent over the next 12 years. This is double what is expected from the OECD. Growth in energy consumption over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6172"> period is expected to be 2.2 per cent, as compared with the OECD, at 1.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is in a great position to play a major role in meeting the demands of this expansion in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in meeting the accelerating demand for energy infrastructure and energy commodities to fuel this projected growth. There is no doubt this growth in energy demand requires a concerted effort by member economies to ensure the development of efficient and environmentally sound energy infrastructure. The challenge is to ensure that energy is not the bottleneck to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Sydney APEC ministers meeting, 14 energy policy principles were adopted. They are aimed at freeing up markets, technical cooperation and mitigation of environmental impact. Reports made at Edmonton by member economies in implementing these principles were in fact very impressive. To some degree it is not surprising, because largely they are market driven. Unless these efficiencies are introduced, unless the markets are opened up, the countries involved will not get the investment, which means they will not get the economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's progress in these reforms stands up well compared with other APEC partners. Our initiatives in the electricity and gas sectors&mdash;removal of export controls on coal, LNG and other minerals except uranium, which I remind the Senate was opposed by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the greenhouse challenge program&mdash;confirm Australia's commitment to these reforms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the interjection of Senator Collins. In my absence I noticed that Mr Beazley said the reason Senator Collins had retired from the frontbench was to go back and look after the Northern Territory. Judging from the results in the Northern Territory election, Bob, it was not a great start. For the benefit of those opposite, these initiatives were well received by the APEC energy ministers and they stand Australia well, particularly in the fiercely competitive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> market emerging in the race to meet energy demands in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential benefits for Australia's electricity industries have been estimated at $5 billion per annum. The removal of export controls represented the removal of a major hurdle to investment and jobs in Australia. Overseas investors no longer need be afraid that a future government will hold them to ransom by misusing export controls&mdash;a threat that remains relevant while those controls continue to exist. Those controls merely raise the spectre of sovereign risk and interference in the supply of vital industrial materials, forcing our customers to diversify their sources of supply at Australia's expense. The major focus of the energy ministers was to improve energy efficiency because of the importance of energy efficiency in addressing climate change.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have to check it is exactly the same one in my office, but there is this complaint and I can answer you with respect to that one at least. Complaints from this person were received in June, and I understand that they were vigorously&mdash;it has been described to me&mdash;pursued by my department. I also understand that my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> department has continued to monitor that particular project. A DEETYA officer spoke with the participants in July, some eight weeks after the project had commenced, and at that time there were no problems identified with the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Team members were fully aware of the phone number of the DEETYA officer to contact and no issues have been subsequently raised, as I am advised. Complaints about any particular Green Corps program can, of course, be drawn to the attention of my department and the contractor. Team members are all provided with a written statement which identifies contact numbers for both the DEETYA officer and the contractor, Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers. Participants are in fact encouraged to contact those numbers if there is an unresolved problem. Green Corps is, as you know, a new program and we believe that early indications are that it is going to be very successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular complaint that I am referring to came from a participant in a Green Corps project in the Hunter Valley. It related to payment to that particular participant. I understand that, when interviewed for project placements, all participants were advised of the conditions being offered and that included the rates of allowance that would be paid. The allowances paid are based on the federal national training wage level C, which takes into consideration years of schooling and the age of the participant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That project commenced in May this year. On 4 June the contractor received a letter signed by some members of the group complaining about the level of allowance and requesting the same level for all participants, and the letter also requested assistance with travel to and from the project site. The DEETYA officer went to the project site and, I think it is fair to say, basically dealt with those particular complainants. There was a change made, as I am advised, to the payment to one participant and the remaining participants, as I understand it, accepted the training wage arrangements. The DEETYA officer agreed to investigate the provision of travel assistance as some participants were in fact having some trouble with that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the DEETYA officer went back via mobile phone some four weeks later and was advised that some limited travel assistance had been provided by the CES under the job seeker preparation and support program. The contractor for Green Corps has also written to the New South Wales state government asking for travel concessions for Green Corps members. The contractor has been asked to constantly review the progress of the project to ensure that any problems identified are dealt with very promptly.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We have seen an extraordinary performance in the Senate today as the government tries to explain its extraordinary backflip over the change on media policy. For 14 months this government tried every device to change the rules on cross&hyphen;media ownership in Australia to advantage one particular proprietor. The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, in particular, made statements again and again saying that he would be introducing legislation; he would be negotiating with his own back bench; he would be negotiating with the parties in the Senate; and he would ultimately introduce legislation some time this session. He had the legislation listed on the government's forward program. He made statements in the media in June saying he would be introducing the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened yesterday is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cut this minister adrift and left him without any credibility on this issue of media policy. This is not the first time this minister has been cut adrift by the Prime Minister. We now have a minister who has no credibility on media policy. If you were involved in any area of media policy on cross&hyphen;ownership rules and you were seeking the views of the government, you would not go to Senator Alston, the minister; you would go to the Prime Minister's office or Mr Costello's office. You would certainly not seek the minister's views because, whatever he said to you, there would be at least a 50&hyphen;50 chance of it being rolled over in cabinet or his being told by the Prime Minister to drop it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that at the last election this minister said he was going to have an open public inquiry into cross&hyphen;ownership rules. That was in his own document. In the middle of last year, Costello and Howard told him to drop it, so he had to drop it. Then he said he would have an internal department of communications inquiry to look at it and seek submissions from the media proprietors, but it would not be made public. It still has not been made public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6175">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only comment he made about that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in a report on 10 February this year when he said the submission from his own department was `pretty tired stuff'. It has not seen the light of day. Since then he has spent endless hours apparently going to the Liberal Party back benchers' committee on media&mdash;including National Party members, as I understand&mdash;trying to convince them that what he was doing was not a deal specifically for one media proprietor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, in the end the back bench jacked him up. They would not agree to any particular proposal. Even today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>

Did it have to do with the occasion on which the deal with the Packers was thrown out? Those questions remain open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 10 years Mr Howard has said that he is a pro market sort of man. He took the posi

We have heard a dissertation from this minister about Senator Schacht and what he should be doing on media policy. What is the minister's media policy now? For 10 years he has condemned the cross&hyphen;media rules that the Labor Party introduced. For 10 years he has said that they have to be scrapped; they have to be reviewed; they are motivated by revenge; they are anachronistic. What is his policy now? Clearly he does not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is quite clear from what has happened today. Senator Alston has come into this chamber completely adrift. He quite clearly is the Prime Minister's doormat on all these issues. So it is quite appropriate for Senator Schacht to ask direct questions to the minister representing the real minister for communications&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised by the tone of the opposition on this matter, particularly as it is a matter that is not really a first order issue, a matter that has been around for a very long time and a matter that was of very doubtful parentage under the previous Labor government, which, as I recall it, was out to get the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6178"> Fairfax organisation when that government set up the cross-media ownership laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of creating a media market that is diversified is not new. It was around for a long time under your government. You may have tried to make a fist of it, but it was not a very good one&mdash;we still have a very highly concentrated market. It has been a problem obviously not only for Australia but worldwide. Worldwide, countries are trying to grapple with this problem&mdash;particularly in highly capital intensive industries like the media, and particularly in small markets like Australia&mdash;of how to create a diverse media ownership base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in our party certainly have had an enormous amount of debate on this. It has not been ideologically driven, and it has not been driven by particular media proprietors. Probably the major media proprietors today are not too happy with the current situation. I do not think that you can say that we were beholden to them. We certainly were not trying to undertake some measure of revenge on a media organisation like Paul Keating was when he first set up the cross&hyphen;media ownership laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a major problem with media ownership laws in this country, and we do not resile from the fact that the current laws are flawed. We put a priority on what are the important issues in this country at this time. This is not a first&hyphen;order issue. It is not an issue which the government should be totally distracted from&mdash;</PARA>

We need to undertake taxation reform. We need to focus on industry policy. We need to focus on native title. These are the first&hyphen;order issues facing this country at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had tackled the media issue and gone with the change to the media rules, what would have happened when it came to the Senate? It would have gone off to a Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry. We would have been held hostage for months by a Senate committee, with people like Senator Schacht grandstanding in front of the inquiry. I have even heard that the Australian Democrats were proposing to subpoena certain witnesses. Senator Schacht could have been in his glory cross-examining Mr Packer, Mr Murdoch and Mr Stokes in such an inquiry. We were not prepared to be held hostage for such a long period on an issue which at this stage is a second&hyphen;order issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue which we must come to some resolution on in this country over time. It is very difficult to set down a new set of rules at this point in time. We have just deregulated the media market in this country. As you are moving towards technologies which could involve, for example, one screen which might deliver your newspaper and also your television picture to you, where will that leave Paul Keating's policy of media proprietors being the prince of print or the queen of screen? Fairly obviously with that very rapidly changing technology you have a situation where, with the market moving quickly, with capital moving into this market and with the changes, you could have emerging over time under the current situation perhaps other players in this field and get to a position where we have diversity of media ownership in this country. That is the position we want to move to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that a party like the Labor Party is getting so excited at this time about the fact that we propose to stay with the current cross-ownership media laws which have been proposed, which your party was proposing. Senator Schacht has reaffirmed the opposition's commitment to the retention of existing media rules. Mr Beazley in May reaffirmed Labor's support for the current rules.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I do know why the minister is not getting this input, but I certainly am getting this input. I am being told that Australians are very worried about media diversity in this country. Australians believe that something has been going on that would cut down on media diversity in this country. Why are they worried about that, why are they concerned, why do they think that is the case if this government was always only ever trying to increase diversity of the media ownership in this country? Obviously they are not very well informed, or perhaps they are only too well informed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a look at all the different plans that were being floated, usually as leaks to different newspaper columnists, for changes to media diversity in this country, you will find that all of those roads led to Rome, that all of those changes to media rules in this country happened to have one outcome. That is what started people worrying. That is what started people thinking that media diversity would in fact go the other way&mdash;that we would have a concentration of media ownership in this country. That would have been the outcome of all the leaked plans. I am sure they were not all made up. In fact I am pretty sure that none of them was made up. That would have been the outcome. That is why people are so worried about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what has changed? Why have the government now decided suddenly&mdash;and it was very sudden&mdash;that this is no longer the case, that in fact they are going to leave the media laws exactly as they are until after the next election? I cannot think of anything, except perhaps two explanations. The first is that they are getting the same sorts of polling results that I have seen, that people are very worried about this. Certainly they are contacting me and telling me that. The second thing is perhaps it has finally occurred to some government ministers that it is really not worth antagonising one major media player in order to help another. Perhaps they were never trying to help one of the major media players, but that is certainly what it looked like and that certainly would have been the effect. If any one of these leaked media plans 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had in fact come into effect, that would have been what would have happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People can be forgiven for believing that there was something in that. I certainly believed there was something in that. I could be wrong&mdash;I hope to goodness I am wrong&mdash;but it certainly looked to me as if the government had a big problem, they were trying to solve that and they were totally unable to do so. It is very sensible of the government to suddenly dump the whole thing. I think in fact Australians are frightened of it; they are frightened of the cuts to media diversity. That will certainly be to the government's credit if they do not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just have a look at that other question that was mentioned, the one which Senator Alston answered that he had always said that this government would maintain funding for the ABC for only a few months, until the end of the then current triennium of ABC funding. What absolute, complete and utter rubbish. We have all seen that television clip of him being asked about it on the night of the election. He was not even looking for votes then; the whole thing had come in. He was asked, `Will you maintain funding to the ABC?' He said, `Yes.' The next question was, `What if there is this enormous black hole and you do not have the money? Will you maintain funding to the ABC?' The answer was something like, `I am sure the Prime Minister will stick by his promises.' The promise was that funding to the ABC would be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go and have a look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better communications</EMPHASIS>. Go and have a look at your own policies that you put out that said the ABC funding would be maintained. It did not say, `Would be maintained for a couple of months.'

Go and read your own policy. Go and read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better communications</EMPHASIS>. It is a totally outrageous use of policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It leads to people not trusting government; you said you wanted people to trust government. It leads to people not believing a word you said. I would be absolutely amazed if anybody believed a word of that at the next 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6180"> election. The whole ABC funding question is one that cannot be defended and should be reversed immediately. I hope that the ALP will say that they will reverse it when they get back into government, and I would be really pleased if the government would also get up and say, `We have seen the light.

We heard Senator Bourne saying that the government is to be congratulated for the stance it has taken in not pursuing this&mdash;and Senator Bourne is nodding her head in agreement. Yet on the same side of politics we heard Senator Carr suggest that this was some dirty, sleazy deal to please the Murdochs. Somebody else suggested that this was part of a sleazy deal cooked up by Messrs Kroger, Costello and others to please the Packers. You cannot have it all three ways.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, I announce today a comprehensive set of financial system reforms in response to the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a major structural reform by the Government which will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with our election commitments, upon taking office the Coalition Government moved quickly to set up the Financial System Inquiry, headed by Mr Stan Wallis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry delivered a high quality Report making 115 recommendations for regulatory reform in the Australian financial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report was directed to the fundamental goals of the Government, to increase competition and improve efficiency, while preserving the integrity, security and fairness of the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system now provides annually over $40 billion worth of services to consumers and other sectors of the economy, directly employs over 300,000 people and plays an increasingly important role as a service export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The performance of the financial system, and the cost effectiveness of its regulation, are critical to the efficient functioning of the whole economy:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> and in its own right, the financial industry can make an increasing contribution to Australia's economic welfare and progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rationale and Goals for Reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved since the major de&hyphen;regulation measures of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After nearly two decades, now is the time to improve the system further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, in a globally competitive world we must strive to be the best. Given its contribution to every other sector of the economy, creating the best possible financial system provides a vital foundation  to Australia's future economic success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Inquiry found Australia's financial sector performance to be close to the world average rather than among the world's best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In every area, there remains room for further improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Reform is needed to secure those potential gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, we must maintain the pace of reform to respond to change. The financial system is undergoing accelerated change through rapid technological innovation, increasing globalisation and changing business strategies and consumer needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our regulatory arrangements must keep up. Existing arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally, and do not always ensure that we get the maximum benefits from change.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6188">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the Wallis Inquiry found that there are a number of areas of the financial system which could be more competitive, and proposed a number of ways to promote more competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government is keen to pursue all of these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the proposals I am announcing today will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> help obtain for Australian consumers and industry the potential benefits of new technologies and world's best practice in the financial system, and at the same time maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industries;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> better focus regulation according to its underlying objectives and ensure that it applies in a competitively neutral way across the newly emerging market structures; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> promote greater competition, and through it the achievement of greater efficiency, across the spectrum of financial and payments services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the reforms that I am announcing today build on the advantages of the existing arrangements, preserving the basic goals of safety and stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED REFORMS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the main proposals for reform of regulatory arrangements in the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key elements of this package are a new organisational framework for the regulation of the financial system and a variety of measures to improve efficiency and contestability in financial markets and the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rationalisation of the Regulatory Framework</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to establish a new regulatory structure based on three agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each agency will be responsible across the system for clear regulatory objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> first, that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be strengthened and its role focused on the objectives of monetary policy, overall financial system stability and regulation of the payments system. As part of this, a new Payments System Board will be appointed within the Reserve Bank with stronger regulatory powers to ensure safety, greater competition and efficiency in the payments system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> secondly, an Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will be established to prudentially supervise deposit taking institutions, life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> thirdly, an Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission (ACFSC) will be estab 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lished to cover market integrity, disclosure and other consumer protection issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new regulatory agencies will have substantial operational autonomy and a clear charter of objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will have boards of directors or commissioners responsible for operational and administrative policies, and will be accountable to the Treasurer and the Parliament for their performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be legislative provisions to authorise the exchange of confidential information amongst the three regulators and there will be close co&hyphen;operation between them, both bilaterally and through a Council of Financial Regulators responsible for coordination across a wide range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In principle, the Government considers that regulation of building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and possibly other financial entities should come under this scheme, and will facilitate this transfer from State to Commonwealth regulation if the States and Territories also agree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the importance of settling the future of these sectors as soon as possible, the Prime Minister will be asking the States and Territories to determine in principle their positions before the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Balancing Prudential and Competition Goals</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Inquiry concluded that prudential regulation should maintain safety while being sufficiently flexible to respond to financial system developments. Prudential arrangements should also  minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with this general approach. We have decided to establish a single licensing and prudential regulation regime for all deposit taking institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will achieve more neutral regulatory treatment and maintain financial safety across all providers of similar deposit products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-bank deposit taking institutions will more readily operate on a national scale and provide more effective competition for banks in the retail market. The new regime will provide a flexible approach to prudential regulation to deal with the unique characteristics of different deposit taking institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licensing and prudential regulation of life insurance products, as for deposit taking, should be provided under a consistent and competitively neutral regime. Therefore, subject to the agreement of the States and Territories, we propose that the financial business of friendly societies be subject to the same regulatory arrangements as life offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To encourage new entry and more effective competition the Government will also: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6189">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitate the establishment of non&hyphen;operating bank holding companies, and allow holding companies to own more than one bank or other licensed entities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> streamline the process of licence issue, transferring responsibility to the prudential regulator;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> remove prohibitions on mutual ownership of banks;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitate possible future participation of a wider range of entities in the deposit taking market; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> streamline the regulation of financial institution shareholdings with a single ceiling of 15 per cent above which Government approvals must be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broad objectives of prudential regulation will be set out in the charter of the regulator. In setting these objectives, the Government will broadly follow the approaches to the conduct of prudential regulation recommended by the Wallis Inquiry, ensuring that standards of financial safety are not diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the conduct of regulation will ensure that the risk of loss of depositor funds remains, as now, very remote and that regulation is consistent with international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prudential standards will as far as possible be reinforced through encouraging greater public disclosure by financial institutions of their risks, management systems and ratings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, total superannuation savings have reached $280 billion and are growing at a much faster rate than bank deposits. They are vital to the retirement security of millions of Australians and for increasing numbers of people represent by far the greater part of their total financial assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APRA will take responsibility for the prudential regulation of superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts. This will create more consistent and effective prudential arrangements for this rapidly growing sector, enhancing its safety while facilitating greater choice, competition and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Maintaining Protection of Depositors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its package of reforms, the Government will fully maintain and in some areas strengthen  the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the protection of depositors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no lessening of protection for bank deposits from that which is currently provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing depositor protection provisions will be retained under the Banking Act and extended to all licensed deposit takers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will involve extending to all regulated deposit taking institutions the priority over the assets of an institution now afforded only to bank depositors. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will apply for the first time to deposits in building societies and credit unions if they join the Commonwealth regulatory scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APRA, instead of the Reserve Bank, will be responsible for dealing with institutions which are unable to meet their obligations, but will undertake this action in close cooperation with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will retain its existing role in providing liquidity support to financial institutions if such assistance is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operational effectiveness of the depositor protection provisions will be strengthened, by providing powers for early intervention in a financially troubled institution and by making clear that the regulator can wind up an insolvent entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APRA will also be given enhanced powers to take action in the case of financial difficulties experienced by life and general insurance companies, and superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APRA will be a separate statutory authority funded by fees and levies from the institutions it regulates and will be outside the Budget sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Promoting Efficiency, Competition and Confidence in the Payments System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has accepted recommendations for further measures to promote efficiency and competition, as well as safety and confidence, in the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payments system is a particularly important, yet little understood, part of the economy. It is the infrastructure that enables resources to be traded and goods to be exchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The smooth functioning of the economy relies on confidence in the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Report concluded that there is considerable scope to increase efficiency in the payments system without compromising its safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts there is a need for greater oversight of the payments system. A Payments System Board and new regulatory powers will be established within the Reserve Bank to regulate clearing and settlement systems, to control risk in the financial system and to promote efficiency and competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reserve Bank will have the power to ensure that clearing stream bodies provide access to their facilities to third parties on reasonable terms. Access to clearing streams and settlement accounts would be liberalised on the basis of clear and open guidelines determined by the PSB. These guidelines will ensure there is no compromise in safety and stability objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater competition in payments services will be possible from new types of players processing payments on behalf of their customers. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6190">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development and application of new payment technologies also have the potential to reduce considerably the costs of financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that they continue to develop with consumer confidence and do not undermine the safety of the financial system, the funds underlying general payments instruments such as electronic cash and stored value cards will be subject to prudential regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has taken careful note of the Inquiry's comments relating to ensuring that there are no impediments to migrating from paper based payments instruments such as cheques to lower cost electronic payment instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts that financial institutions will need to reflect the cost advantages of more efficient systems in the overall pricing structure of their services. At the same time, the Government is not yet assured that the financial system is adequately competitive to ensure that pricing is always fair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, it will continue to monitor informally developments in relation to financial sector fees and charges and will oppose any unfair or uncompetitive practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Promoting More Effective Disclosure and Consumer Protection</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has announced today a comprehensive set of financial system reforms in response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry, the so-called Wallis inquiry. These reforms will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian businesses and consumers. I believe they are to be very warmly welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals will&mdash;and I summarise&mdash;help Australian consumers and businesses enjoy the benefits of new technologies and world's best practice in the financial system and maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industries. It will focus regulation on its underlying objectives and ensure regulation operates in a competitively neutral manner across the market spectrum and it will promote greater competition and efficiency across financial and payment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, the reforms also build on the advantages of existing arrangements in preserving their basic goals of safety and stability. The key elements of the reforms&mdash;the financial system regulatory arrangements&mdash;are new organisational arrangements for the regulation of the financial system and various measures to improve efficiency and contestability in financial markets and the payments system. The new regulatory structure will be based on three 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6192"> agencies, with each agency responsible across the system for clear regulatory objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided first that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be strengthened and its role focused on the objectives of monetary policy, overall financial system stability and the regulation of the payments system. A new payments system board will be appointed within the bank with stronger regulatory powers to ensure safety, greater competition, and efficiency in the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, an Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the APRA, will be established to prudentially supervise deposit taking institutions, life and general insurance companies, and superannuation funds. Thirdly, an Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission, the ACFSC, will be established to cover market integrity, disclosure and other consumer protection issues. The new regulatory agencies will have substantial operational autonomy and a clear charter of objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that prudential regulation should maintain safety while being able to respond flexibly to financial system developments. Arrangements should also minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency. Accordingly, a single licensing and prudential regulation regime for all deposit taking institutions will be established. This will mean providers of similar deposit products face a more neutral regulatory treatment while maintaining financial safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To encourage new entry and more competition, the government will also facilitate the establishment of non&hyphen;operating bank holding companies and allow holding companies to own more than one bank or other licensed entities; streamline the process of licence issue; remove prohibitions on mutual ownership of banks; facilitate possible future wider participation in the deposit taking market; and streamline the regulation of financial institution shareholdings with a single ceiling of 15 per cent, above which approvals must be obtained. Prudential standards will be reinforced by encouraging more public disclosure by financial institutions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total superannuation savings have reached some $280 billion and are growing at a much faster rate than bank deposits. Superannuation is vital to the retirement security of millions of Australians and, for increasing numbers of people, superannuation assets represent by far their most important financial asset. The government treats prudential regulation of these assets very seriously indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APRA will be responsible for the prudential regulation of superannuation funds and RSAs. This will provide more consistent and more effective prudential arrangements for this important sector, enhancing its safety while facilitating greater choice, competition and efficiency consistent with the government's retirement income objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of its reforms, the government will fully maintain and, in some areas, strengthen the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the protection of depositors. The effectiveness of these arrangements is, of course, of great importance. Protection of bank deposits will not be reduced. The priority over the assets of an institution afforded to bank depositors will be extended to all regulated deposit taking institutions. This will apply for the first time to deposits in building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The smooth functioning of the economy certainly relies on confidence in the payments system. The government has accepted recommendations for further measures to promote efficiency and competition as well as safety and confidence in the payments system. A Payments System Board and new regulatory powers will be established within the Reserve Bank to regulate clearing and settlement systems, to control risk in the financial system and to promote efficiency and competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the inquiry also made a range of recommendations aimed at achieving a more effective and efficient disclosure regulation, better regulation of securities and futures markets, the promotion of the coordination and extension of dispute resolution schemes, and the overhauling of the regulation of financial advice. The government has endorsed a range of recommendations aimed at achieving more effective disclosure and consumer protection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has announced this response to the financial systems inquiry, otherwise known as the Wallis inquiry. Many of the Wallis report's 115 recommendations are very broad brush, with the detail to be filled in. Today's statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) fills in some of that detail but there is still a long way to go. Legislation to implement the Wallis reforms will not be seen until next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor supports in principle the basic regulatory thrust of Wallis but we have reserved our right to scrutinise the detail. Although the Treasurer's statement today has filled in more of that detail, we still have to see actual legislation, some of which will be extremely detailed and complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor understands the profound sweeping changes throughout the financial industry. This change is the product of financial deregulation, stunning technological progress and globalisation. In the past, banks, life offices, superannuation funds and general 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> insurers operated in quite distinct markets. However, with financial deregulation and technological change, the difference between the products offered by these various institutions is becoming increasingly blurred. Life offices are now offering deposit type products which were once virtually the sole preserve of banks. Superannuation funds are entering the home mortgage market, as are the new mortgage originators, and banks are offering superannuation and general insurance products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no signs of any slowing in the convergence in the services provided by different financial institutions. If anything, the trend seems to be accelerating. As a country, we must put in place a new regulatory framework to accommodate the tremendous changes that are occurring. This is exactly what the Wallis report recommends. At the heart of the Wallis report are the recommendations to create two new regulatory bodies for the financial system by rearranging the responsibilities of the existing regulators. This regulatory structure, which is supported by Labor, has been endorsed today by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On prudential regulation, the Wallis proposal is that supervision of financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry, be undertaken by a new body, the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission, which today has been renamed by the Treasurer as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. The APRA will pick up many of the current prudential supervisory responsibilities of the Reserve Bank, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the financial institutions scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the creation of a single national prudential regulator in this form as desirable. While the current system generally works well, there are no compelling arguments against moving to a new structure that will accommodate more naturally the profound changes that are taking place in the financial services market. On the other hand, there are compelling arguments for bringing all deposit taking institutions under a single prudential regulator. Bringing all deposit taking institutions together under the same regulator will help achieve a more level playing field 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6194"> between banks, credit unions and building societies. After all, credit unions and building societies provide financial services similar to those of banks and it is appropriate that they be regulated within the same framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the Reserve Bank regulates the banks while credit unions and building societies are regulated by the AFIC under the FI scheme. The Wallis inquiry was presented with substantial evidence that the state based regulatory schemes, credit unions and building societies, while having raised prudential standards considerably, were cumbersome, duplicative and costly. As a result, the Wallis report found that, if credit unions and building societies are to be an effective source of competition for the banks in the retail market, it is fundamental that they be able to operate on a national basis and compete on the same regulatory terms as banks. The Labor opposition endorses this key finding of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to consumer protection, the current regulation of financial services in Australia is highly fragmented. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Payment Systems Council and state and territory bodies responsible for administering state fair trading laws all have consumer protection responsibilities. It obviously makes good sense for the current fragmented consumer protection arrangements to be rationalised in a new body, as the Wallis report proposes, and the Labor opposition supports that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while it is logical that the proposed new Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission acts as the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day consumer protection and market conduct regulator for the financial services sector, we believe that the ACCC should retain its role as the economy&hyphen;wide regulator of consumer protection. It has real teeth, has been willing to use them and should not be gutted, although there is obviously scope for some resource rationalisation within the new body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our real concern has always been that the ACCC would be completely dealt out of consumer protection in the financial services industry and that this would be the first step 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> towards fragmentation of the economy&hyphen;wide approach to consumer regulation. At the very least, the ACCC and the ACFSC should maintain a close working relationship, preferably under a clear operating agreement, with the ACCC retaining a reserve capacity to intervene if necessary to ensure the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maintaining strong consumer protection in the financial sector is absolutely essential, and the government must not use the Wallis proposals as a device to water down that protection. Unfortunately, today's statement by the Treasurer is very unclear about the future relationship between the ACCC and the ACFSC. In addition, the Treasurer says that the ACFSC `will be given the same general consumer protection laws to enforce as currently exist under the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act.' This approach causes us a great deal of concern. We fear that it could mean the fragmentation of consumer protection legislation. In addition, the Treasurer does not define what is meant by `the same general consumer protection laws.' There is a clear danger that the new consumer protection legislation for the financial services industry would be weaker than the current provision of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we are extremely concerned that the ACFSC is properly funded and resourced to ensure that it can perform its regulatory duties effectively. We do not want an under-resourced toothless tiger consumer regulator in this key sector of the economy. While the Wallis recommendations involve some rationalisation of the existing regulatory framework, the report firmly rejected the Treasurer's ill- considered proposal of a single mega-regulator for the financial system. A mega-regulator would have been a bureaucratic monster and prudential and consumer protection standards would have inevitably suffered under a single body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to turn my attention to some consumer protection issues relating to today's announcements on superannuation. The government is proposing new regulatory arrangements for the protection of superan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6195"> nuation funds which are lost as a result of theft and fraud. Under current arrangements, the Treasurer has the power to grant financial assistance to a superannuation fund which suffers a loss of funds due to theft or fraud when he or she considers it to be in the public interest. The Treasurer may also impose a levy on each superannuation fund in the industry of up to 0.05 per cent of the fund's assets to raise the required amount to meet the funds which are stolen or lost through fraudulent conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government's new arrangements significantly weaken the superannuation fund protection measures. Firstly, under the new measure, the Treasurer would only need to apply a national interest test rather than a public interest test in determining whether he or she should grant financial assistance to a superannuation fund which suffers from theft and fraud. Labor believes that the public interest test should remain. The government's No. 1 priority should be to secure every Australian's retirement nest egg, which is the funds contained in every Australian superannuation account, from theft and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the new measures propose that the Treasurer's grant of financial assistance to a superannuation fund should be reduced from up to 100 per cent under the current arrangements to 80 per cent of the entitlements of the beneficiaries of a fund. This is a significant watering down of the current superannuation protection measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the millions of Australians with monies invested in superannuation accounts will be shocked to hear that, under the government's proposed model, in the event of theft and fraud of their superannuation monies, they will receive only $8 out of $10 of their benefits rather than the full 100 per cent they are entitled to under the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor strongly opposes any measure to reduce the entitlements of all Australians to receive the full amount of their superannuation benefits if they are lost as a result of theft and fraud. This is particularly important given the increased spread of superannuation and increased levels of contributions as a result of the previous Labor government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superannuation policies, which would have been further increased had the Liberal government not failed to honour its commitment to pay the three plus three per cent co-contribution into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the government's new arrangements will only apply to superannuation fund losses which result from fraud. Does that mean Australian superannuation funds will no longer be protected from theft? Labor strongly believes there should be no weakening of the current arrangements which protect superannuation monies from both theft and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protection of superannuation is of the utmost importance to Labor. With the inevitable greater reliance on superannuation for retirement, Australians must be able to rest easy that their retirement nest egg is safe and secure. Protection measures should not be weakened, as the government is proposing, but should be maintained and even extended to post-retirement products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this government's ideological drive to choice, there is a real risk that some Australians will be misled into the wrong choice and suffer as a consequence through theft and fraud and higher fees and charges, as occurred in the United Kingdom and outlined in the recent Office of Fair Trading report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes there is a strong case for monitoring superannuation fees and charges and, in some cases, regulating the post-retirement products. Time does not allow me to cover other areas. I will conclude my remarks there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats believe that reform of the Australian financial system was necessary. But after hearing the Treasurer (Mr Costello) speak we are reminded more and more of former Treasurer Paul Keating's words. We remember Mr Costello's hyperbole about last year's budget, the one that `offers sustainable growth, more jobs and higher living standards'. We are then reminded of former Treasurer Keating's budget, the budget to `bring home the bacon'&mdash;the one that failed to live up to expectations&mdash;which actually delivered lower growth, higher 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6196"> unemployment and an $8 a week cut in Australian family living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it in that context because today we heard another promise for the future from Treasurer Costello. Today he promised us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a major structural reform from the government which will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfortunately, we have heard it all before. I think we are still right to be sceptical. Mr Keating made similar claims about financial deregulation reforms in the 1980s but he got it only half right. They did deliver billions of dollars of benefits but only to banking businesses, not to the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember that consumers have really been the big losers out of financial deregulation. Interest rates, particularly housing interest rates, are higher now in real terms than they were before financial deregulation. Australian small businesses are still stuck in what even Mr Costello acknowledges is a non-competitive market, with the highest real interest rates on loans of any OECD country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true the reforms announced today are significant. They are reforms&mdash;and I agree with the Treasurer on this&mdash;which will help make aspects of banking more competitive by allowing building societies, credit unions, insurance companies, finance companies and superannuation funds to compete more effectively against the banks, particularly in the financial payments system area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the jury is still out. I do not think you could confidently assert today that the reforms will be of major and lasting change. They may or they may not be. We must not overestimate the market power of the big four banks that currently control about 67 per cent of banking business&mdash;one of the most concentrated banking markets this side of the former Iron Curtain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats welcome the proposal to provide a common regulator for banks, building societies, credit unions and other financial corporations. This long overdue measure will allow these institutions to compete on a fairer basis. But we are a little more concerned about the abolition of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as the need for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> black letter law on fund managers' duties and prudential requirements has long been accepted in this place. We will need to be assured that folding the ISC into a generalist regulator does not result in a reduction in the regulatory standards on so-called competitive neutrality grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also give in principle support to the separation of the consumer protection functions from the prudential supervision function. The Reserve Bank and the ISC were both always stronger on prudential issues, in our view, than on consumer protection issues. The formal separation of these roles should result in higher priority being given to consumer issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are concerned that the government, in its response, has undercut the careful balance in the Wallis report on consumer protection issues. Wallis recommended that the new Corporations and Financial Services Commission have the power to make and enforce mandatory codes of conduct. That recommendation does not appear to have been picked up by the government because they have this consistent policy where everything has to be a voluntary code, even though we know voluntary codes do not necessarily work&mdash;and I would say that in most instances they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wallis recommended that privacy needed to be regulated on a national basis by the Privacy Commissioner. The government has already rejected national privacy laws, opting instead for a mixture of state rules and voluntary codes&mdash;the exact opposite approach to what Wallis recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wallis wanted a more comprehensive centralised dispute resolution scheme&mdash;in particular, one that picked up small business&mdash;but the government has not mentioned small business in this response. It has interpreted the one-stop scheme to simply mean a single phone number for complaints, and it appears quite happy to see the efficacy of the current dispute schemes watered down. I think this is a pretty weak response, based on what Mr Wallis recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has picked up the Wallis recommendation to move banking consumer functions from the ACCC to the new Corpo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6197"> rations and Financial Services Commission. This recommendation worries us, as the CFSC appears likely to be an add-on to the Australian Securities Commission, which has a far less satisfactory record of defending consumers than has the ACCC. So we are going to watch this particular aspect of the government's response very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the government have recognised that bank fees and charges are occurring in a `non-competitive' market, they have offered nothing more than `informal monitoring'. We all know what that means: giving the banks an occasional limp slap on the wrist. And we know from 15 years of bitter experience that they will completely ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But probably the most worrying of the consumer issues in the government's response is the approach to prudential standards. While the government has picked up the Wallis recommendation to give preference to depositors in a winding up, it appears to have rejected Wallis's important recommendation to retain quantitative prudential requirements such as capital adequacy, liquidity and large exposure limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this response the banks are to get a $200 million a year gift from Mr Costello from the abolition of prudential requirements for non-callable deposits at the Reserve Bank. The prudential standards for credit unions and building societies could be reduced by abolishing the compulsory contingency reserve system in favour of a voluntary scheme. These are major changes which will need to be carefully scrutinised to ensure that consumers are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there could be real competition benefits from this package of reforms, but that depends on how effective the banks are in defending their market share. Personally, if you will excuse the pun, my money is on the banks because of their already dominant market position and the huge reserves built from recent massive profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect the benefits forecast by Mr Costello are exaggerated and certainly will not arrive without active intervention by the government. I also suspect that Mr Costello, like Mr Wallis, like Mr Keating before him, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has underestimated the potential downside of financial reform and that his cutting of corners on consumer protection will result in consumers losing out all too often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have learnt anything from 15 years of financial deregulation it is that relying on the banks to do the right thing does not work. Black letter law, firm and vigilant regulators, strong codes of conduct, mandatory dispute resolution schemes and deliberate market interventions to correct clear market failures like excessive fees and charges are the absolute necessary ingredients to delivering consumer benefits from banking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we see Treasurer Costello's legislation for the APRA and the CFSC and the operating guidelines and personnel, we will not know whether he has the balance right. The corner cutting in today's statement on consumer standards, in our view, does not augur particularly well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved since the major de&hyphen;regulation measures of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is useful to go back to the terms of reference of the Wallis inquiry to see that statement in context. The specifics of the terms of reference state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry will report on the results arising from the financial deregulation flowing from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the Australian Financial System</EMPHASIS>  (Campbell report) published in 1981. This will involve examining and reporting the consequences for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the choice, quality and cost of financial services available to consumers and other users; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6198">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is a little different from what is there. It just says `efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector'. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the efficiency of the financial system including its international and domestic competitiveness;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the economic effects of deregulation on growth, employment and savings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the evolution of financial institutions and products offered by them and the impact on the regulatory structure of the industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it was to look at other issues that the inquiry would identify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement that `the Wallis Inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved' at the very least needed to be highly qualified by asking whether this is worked out by using averages. It may well be that choice has improved in the Australian financial sector if we look at the fact that more packages are available in specific sectors. We have to look at actually how much of the sector now is involved in international finance transactions&mdash;mostly speculative transactions. A greater level of choice may well be involved in those transactions but less choice may well be available for individual savings holders, and that is not mentioned in that particular statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to efficiency, is the system efficient if you cannot speak face to face to the person who handles your account? I guess somebody is speaking to you, but they do not know who you are. They are on the end of a line, and they are in a central system. This might be efficient from the bank's point of view, but it is a bit difficult if you want to be able to explain your particular circumstance and do not want to be treated as a number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to quality and choice in Australia's financial sector, are you a person who is concerned about the use of technology? Do you find it difficult to use flexitellers? Has your bank been closed? Do you have choice about where you can go to conduct your banking services these days? As I say, whilst choice might be greater in the total number of services in relation to the financial sector, it may well be that the choice for individual consumers&mdash;and that word `individual' has been left out&mdash;has decreased in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many instances, especially for those people for whom it is no longer profitable to provide the range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As to quality, I guess that is something that is personal to many people, but there are concerns in relation to that. But it seems that this statement left out almost totally the issues of whether or not the deregulation of the financial sector has had other impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a small summary of what are considered to be the disappointments within this report on the deregulation of the financial sector. The first one, on page 595 of the Wallis report, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excessive credit expansion in the mid to late 1980s, coupled with declining lending standards and resultant loan losses&mdash;contributed to the severity of the early 1990s recession.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am glad there is some recognition of that. There does not seem to be much in this statement by the Treasurer. It seems that it is incredible that it has taken us 16 years to look at the impacts of what we did back in the 1980s and how we did it and whether we did it in the right way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the reason the financial sector was deregulated was actually pushed by the push towards the deregulation of trade. Australia, like other countries, was required to move towards deregulation of the financial and banking sector as part of the move to the Uruguay Round of GATT. So in fact, in some senses, many people in Australia felt that we had no choice. The way we chose to do that, though, was a matter of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deregulation of the system basically has had an impact on many people. That can be summarised in some of the issues on page 703 of the Wallis inquiry report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these ideas associate financial deregulation with other, broader trends&mdash;for example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the pressure which financial markets are said to have exerted on governments to reduce the size of the public sector and privatise publicly&hyphen;owned assets, especially major infrastructure;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* deregulation of labour and product markets and resulting changes in wage and income distribution;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It certainly has contributed&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6199">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* changes in the rural economy and rural life, associated with difficulties in obtaining finance on suitable terms or seeing bank branches withdrawn from country towns; and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* acceleration of the adoption of labour&hyphen;shedding technology, causing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is hard to fault the logic of that last item but those points were not followed up, nor were the concerns about general unemployment issues associated with the total deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that the report's conclusions were inferential:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The freeing of the formerly controlled interest rates should have led to a better allocation of resources, which should have led to a more productive economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ho, hum, we are still waiting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The removal of credit rationing in the banking sector should have led to more efficient financing and pricing of production.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh, yes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Freeing of inward and outward capital flows should have increased the efficiency of investment in Australian industry, by widening the pool of potential investors, and the efficiency of investment of Australian capital, by widening the range of investment opportunities and facilitating diversification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">* As one of a set of changes which helped expose Australian industry to greater international pressure, financial deregulation should have encouraged reforms in the real economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite frankly, because the Wallis report did not actually look at the connections between financial deregulation and the internationalisation of the economy, they never assessed whether there was anything connecting those. So it seems that we are basing a major change&mdash;I call it `a change' rather than a `necessary reform'&mdash;to the Australian financial system on a report that largely did not do what it was meant to do. It did not really look at the implications of the way Australia deregulated the economy. It basically assumed that deregulation was good, and let's have more, and it basically is moving towards a particular direction without necessarily the systematic inquiries and referrals that should have occurred along the way. Why is it that we had to wait 16 years for such an inquiry?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of work needs to be done. We should not just assume that all of these changes are inevitable. In the end, the people we do have to ask about are those who have no choice, who are the small fry within the financial and banking systems at the moment&mdash;those people who are the customers of the banks, not the big players, not those people who speculate and not those people who perhaps, along with speculators in the United States and Europe, actually end up controlling many of the aspects of the Australian economy now. That is a major impact of Australia and other countries deregulating the financial sector&mdash;that Australians are having policies directed by other countries, and this should not be played down; we should actually be looking at the impact of that and how it is that international money speculators can direct Australia's policies on social, economic and even environmental issues and the way the dollar can be used in terms of that direction. So I think it is time for change but I do think it is time for us to change with our eyes open instead of just assuming that we have to do, like lemmings, what everybody else is doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, it is with mixed senses of both responsibility and honour and a not insignificant feeling of relief that I finally stand here to make this, my first speech in this place as a senator for New South Wales. After some months of unnatural silent observation, I am pleased to revert to type: on my feet holding forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you, Madam President, for your guidance on my introduction to this chamber, and to the clerks, officers and attendants for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6200"> their assistance and support. I also want to thank my staff&mdash;Karen Smith, Hazel Elliott and Georgina Inwood&mdash;for their loyalty and support over the past few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, my presence in this chamber is the culmination of a long held desire to make a contribution to the Australian political process&mdash;a desire I have pursued over many years with the faith and support of my family and friends, in many cases long suffering. For a child from a non&hyphen;political background my aberrant and obsessional political behaviour often bemused my parents and sibling. My mother and brother, who are present in the gallery, are the constants both in my life and over more than 15 years in Liberal politics. It is my great regret that my father, my mentor, is not with me today. A World War II veteran, a chartered accountant by profession and a farmer by passion, he gave me every opportunity in life and with his guidance I have tried to make the most of them. It is often remarked that it is difficult to make true friends in politics. I am pleased to say that my true friends, the ones who always tell me when I am wrong, are here today in number as they have been so many times before and I am grateful for the strength of their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I began my political life with the view that as a young Australian I had a responsibility to become involved; to make a contribution if I wished to have a say in the future of my country. I am a product of the Liberal Party of New South Wales, which I joined in 1982&mdash;a party with strong and proud traditions which is honoured to count amongst its number the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard). In fact, the Prime Minister and I began our political lives, although some decades apart, in the same Young Liberal branch in suburban Sydney. I have served on my party's state executive since 1987, have been a member of the federal executive and done virtually any job that needed doing since I joined the organisation over 15 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former state and federal president of the Young Liberal Movement I am proud to have been made a life member of the New South Wales division of the Young Liberals. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are indeed a formidable but, more importantly, a valuable political organisation, encouraging political debate, campaigning and training amongst their membership. They are fiercely loyal to the traditions of the Movement and to the principles on which our party was founded. They, as do I, hold these words of our party's founder, Sir Robert Menzies, as tenets of faith, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We took the name `Liberal' because we were determined to be a progressive party, willing to make experiments, in no sense reactionary, but believing in the individual, his rights and his enterprise . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As a young party member I learnt the value of political training and professionalism from the experts. I was fortunate to work over a number of years with great Liberals: my friends the Hon. Ted Pickering, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, my now leader Senator the Hon. Robert Hill and my colleague the Finance Minister the Hon. John Fahey. With these Liberals, as a young, inexperienced political activist, I learnt a great deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am committed to maximising the participation of young Australians in our political process. If I can follow the example and support given to me, I will have made some small contribution to that endeavour. I also salute the women of the Liberal Party. It has not always been an easy road but the great successes of the Liberal Women's Forum, particularly in the 1996 election, have set in concrete the importance of our efforts. The faith, the tenacity and the mutual support of the women won through. As the youngest woman in the coalition, I am proud to join the ranks of women in Canberra and hope to welcome many more female colleagues here in the next few years. I need say no more about the involvement of women in politics than to invoke the words of one of the world's great political leaders, Burma's Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the prerogative of men alone to bring light to this world. Women&mdash;with their capacity for compassion and self sacrifice, their courage and perseverance&mdash;have done much to dissipate the darkness of intolerance and hate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As a newly appointed senator for New South Wales I have opened my office in the heart of the greatest city in Australia, in Parramatta in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6201"> greater western Sydney. I am proud to join my Liberal colleagues Ross Cameron, the member for Parramatta, and Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay, in their electorates. The Liberal Party in greater western Sydney is now represented by three young, enthusiastic, committed Liberals and we are there to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater western Sydney is one of the most important economic regions in Australia. In a recent speech by the Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister, Tim Fischer, he acknowledged the region as `one of Australia's economic powerhouses', with a GDP of $34 billion and a population of 1.4 million. With its commitment to excellence, its enthusiasm, innovation and commitment to Australia, the contribution made by business in greater western Sydney to Australia's economic performance is second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifty years ago in this place, in October 1947, the first female Liberal senator, Queensland Senator Annabel Rankin, made her first speech. In quoting her words I also acknowledge her role as one of the trailblazers for Australian women in politics. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity will arise for me to express my opinion on particular topics; but I believe that, today, I should invite honourable senators to pause in the midst of political tumult, lift their eyes above the mists, and try to see for themselves where Australia is heading.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In inviting honourable senators to do the same today, to `lift their eyes above the mists', I ask that on behalf of all young Australians. Throughout my short political life, I have been absolutely committed to maximising the involvement of young Australians in politics. I regard one of my particular responsibilities as a parliamentarian as being to communicate ideas and policies to the young people of this country who are our future and to listen to their responses and views about where Australia is heading. There is no replacement for effective communication and young Australians deserve nothing less than to have their politicians listen to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking above the mists, as Senator Rankin exhorted her colleagues, I look to a future Australia that is proud of its diverse and varied community. From Australia's original indigenous inhabitants to the first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> European settlers to migrants from the many hundreds of countries now represented here, we live in peace in one of the richest communities in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no room, in my view, for the division and destruction wrought by hate based race politics. The jingoistic simplicity of the One Nation mantra may have an hypnotic effect on some Australians, but the danger of the extremist politics practised by One Nation remains. Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has been identified as a threat to our trading relations, as having a negative impact on tourism and to the uptake of Australian services by international consumers. But, Madam President, ultimately it is simply offensive, unacceptable and morally repugnant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that I am a product of the Liberal Party organisation. I was a member of the organisation's federal executive for two years and, as one who has sat around that table and many others, I believe it is also time for that body to address the challenge to the traditions of decent, fair&hyphen;minded tolerant Australian politics represented by the rise of One Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only for our migrants but for indigenous Australians, political life has been momentous over the last two years. I am not a parent, but I am a daughter, a sister, and a granddaughter. My commitment to and love for my family has guided my life. I watched, read and listened with interest to discussions surrounding the release of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report into The Stolen Generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not but put myself in the position of those whose stories filled the report. As I was growing up in my safe and stable family, in my home and at my school, children my age in Aboriginal Australia were still being taken from their homes, their parents and their siblings. I can never feel their pain, but I can try to understand the devastation I would feel in their situation, and I can apologise for those misguided acts. As a nation we must answer the challenge of reconciliation now for the memory of those for whom it is already too late and for the sake of future generations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6202">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A future Australia should be a nation free from discrimination against any individual. Discrimination against people based on their gender, their race, their sexuality, their religion, their HIV status or their education does not belong in our democracy. Before I hear the clamouring cries of right&hyphen;wing media commentators about political correctness: this is not a statement about women's rights, gay rights or minority rights; rather, it is about human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about the essence of liberalism&mdash;the freedom of the individual to live their lives as they see fit whilst respecting in every case the rights of others; developing their own individual potential to the fullest; enjoying the right to be judged on their own individual merit; and, importantly, being respected simply as an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often I have seen at first&hyphen;hand the impact of discrimination against people based on their HIV status. As a committee member of the AIDS Council of New South Wales, I have tried to redress this in some small way, and it is in this context that I recognise the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales. With the rest of the world, I was stunned by news of her untimely passing&mdash;a young woman, only three years older than me. Her contribution to the campaigns fighting, firstly, discrimination against people with AIDS and, secondly, for a ban on the use of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines are indicative of her commitment to humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As they look towards the future, young Australians will hopefully look to a strong nation continuing to stand boldly on the world stage in political, trade and diplomatic terms. For almost 10 years, my interest has been in developing relations between young political and business leaders from Australia and the nations in our region. Between Australia and a score of countries in Asia, dozens of young leaders have exchanged visits and formed lasting relationships under the auspices of many programs, and particularly the Australia&hyphen;Asia Young Leaders Program, of which I was a committee member until my appointment to the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's economic and diplomatic interests will be most effectively advanced if young Australians take an active role in pursuing our relationships in Asia. In addition to exchange programs, there are valuable opportunities to maximise interest in the Australian education system in Asia, and particularly to encourage young Australians to learn and utilise Asian languages in their education and later business lives. I believe the next 10 years must bring enormous increases in the level of engagement of young Australians in Asia, an investment both for their own benefit and for the long-term development of our relationships in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also my fervent hope that the view to the future includes an Australian head of state. The debate on constitutional change should proceed in a constructive and enlightened manner, with young Australians as very active participants in that process. My hope is that we will as a nation be able to take the best of our history and traditions which have served us for almost a century and build on them towards an Australian republic. During my time in this parliament, with the will of the majority of Australians in favour of change, I know I will see an Australian&mdash;one of us, who lives amongst us and is chosen by Australians&mdash;take up office as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, for all Australians, when I look above the political tumult to the future, I hope to see a nation that is strong and confident in itself. That will be so if the youth of our nation can face the future with strength and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that there is a number of pressing social issues challenging young Australians that it is our responsibility as political leaders to address. Preservation and repair of the natural environment, cooperative efforts by community and government to reduce homelessness, and a drug use prevention strategy that really works are examples of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's efforts to introduce policies to address the seemingly intractable problem of youth unemployment will go a long way to returning confidence and hope to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6203"> young Australians and faith in the future of their nation. But the largely hidden national tragedy of youth suicide is more difficult to grapple with. My strong view is that summits and talk fests are of limited utility. They give no hope&mdash;no hope at all to the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For young people in this nation, and predominantly young men, suicide is the only answer to their desperation, all too commonly chosen. Young Australians have a right not to have to live with that fear, and it is incumbent upon us to help find the answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, there are few good things written about politicians but many challenges issued to us. The great Australian writer Patrick White issued this challenge in his poem <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nine thoughts from Sydney</EMPHASIS>, an appropriate selection perhaps for a senator from New South Wales. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where is the politician who will flower like the leptospermum citrata,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who will sound like the surf out of the Antarctic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who has in his hands the knots of coolibah,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in his soul the tears of migrants landing from Piraeus?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we, as members of parliament, bear the sentiments of this challenge in mind in our words and our deeds, then I for one believe we will better earn the respect of our communities and perhaps ignite in young Australians a flame of faith in their parliamentary system and their parliamentary representatives. That for me is a challenge worth meeting. Thank you, Madam President.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report reviews audit reports of the Auditor-General which were tabled in the second quarter of 1996-97. Three of those audit reports were selected by the JCPA to be examined at public hearings which were held on 3 February. These were <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 13, Tax Debt Collection, Audit Report No. 15, Food Provisioning in the Australian Defence Force </EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 17, Workforce Planning in the Australian Defence Force.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA'S report does not attempt to analyse in detail all of the audit findings and recommendations in those three reports. Instead it draws attention to key issues discussed at the hearings and highlights commitments given by witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit on tax debt collection was a constructive exercise which resulted in a number of sensible and useful recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Australian Taxation Office. An Audit Office analysis indicated that a combination of minor improvements to the timeliness of debt 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6204"> collection and the effectiveness of recovery levels would result in potentially significant net ongoing benefits to the Commonwealth. The audit report estimated that even a modest improvement would provide a net benefit to the Commonwealth of $142 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA's review of the debt collection report highlighted three issues of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these is the risk that penalties for the late payment of tax are not being administered by the Tax Office in accordance with the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation requires that additional charges be automatically imposed when a tax debt is paid late. An assessment by the Audit Office showed that 35 per cent of the outstanding debt cases finalised by payment in 1995-96 had no ATLP imposed. The results of this assessment were supported by the findings of an internal Tax Office audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it is a fact that taxpayers with large tax debts are more likely to have late payment penalties remitted than taxpayers with small debts. The audit report noted the risk that penalties may be being used as a negotiating tool in debt collection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA considers that both practices are wrong and represent an unacceptable risk to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the JCPA has a concern that too often litigation is pursued where negotiation would produce better results. it appears that good central Tax Office policy is not always matched by good regional office practice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA's review of food provisioning in the Defence Force again highlighted significant shortcomings in the ability of Defence's financial management systems to generate accurate information on the total costs of Defence activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence was unable to provide the total cost of providing rations to Defence Force personnel to the Audit Office or at the hearing and took some time to construct an estimate of cost after the event. Defence's estimate of the total cost of food provisioning was $277 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of ready access to such information makes it extremely difficult for Defence to manage its resources efficiently and to account adequately for its expenditure and performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that much remains to be done in Defence to reform financial management systems and practices. Financial management reform needs to be a clear priority for Defence as it prepares itself for the Commonwealth's new accrual budgeting environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in the audit report and at the hearing, the fundamental flaw in food provisioning is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absence of a clear, ADF-wide policy on food provisioning. The audit office highlighted the resulting risks that procedures on food provisioning are not aligned to Defence Force objectives and may not be cost effective or best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force has acknowledged the deficiency and the JCPA has been advised by Defence that a policy will be in place by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third and final report that the JCPA examines in this report is workforce planning in the Australian Defence Force. Workforce planning is an issue of central importance to the quality and preparedness of the Defence Force. It is also an issue of great complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit report attempted to assess the workforce planning systems used by the Defence Force with a view to identifying better practice and making recommendations to promote the overall effectiveness of planning systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main challenges identified during the review was the need to devolve a greater degree of management responsibility from Defence Force Headquarters to individual Defence managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although a balance needs to be maintained when devolving responsibilities in an environment that has a demand for strong central controls, the Committee considers that the advantages to be gained from increased management flexibility are significant. It is a balance which, if achieved, could help overcome many of the rigidities and inefficiencies in Defence's workforce planning systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is clear to the Committee that Defence faces some fundamental workforce planning problems. The Committee accepts that the personnel managers require better tools and levers for managing the strength of the service than are currently used and notes the efforts currently being made in Defence to address a number of workforce planning issues.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a new commission to replace the Industry Commission. It has significant new functions. I have listed some of them. For example, one new function is to provide advice to the minister, additional to that flowing from a reference. In effect, that means the minister can do almost anything he wishes and seek material of any nature, outside a specific reference. That is a very significant increase in the power of the Productivity Commission as compared with the old Industry Commission. We do not believe that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I see that I advanced some significant arguments yesterday. I do not want to keep the committee unduly in the process of this legislation but I am certainly not convinced of the arguments that were put by Senator Campbell yesterday in opposing the amendment we are dealing with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about the functions of the commission and, as I understand it, we are dealing with opposition amendment 2. That details what the functions of the commission are to be:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to hold inquiries and make reports to the Minister in respect of such <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> matters relating to industry development and productivity as are referred to it by the Minister; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to do anything incidental to those functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that was a fairly broad remit for the commission, but perhaps the minister would like to address the point that was made by Senator Sherry&mdash;and no doubt he will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look at what it is proposed is to be changed, which is in Part 2, clause 6 of the Productivity Commission Bill, headed `Functions of the Commission'. As far as I can see, there may be two or three matters in that proposal by the government which may not be contained within the scope of the opposition's amendments. As I see it, they are (b), (e) and (f).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause (b) of the government's proposal says that the functions of the commission are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies as directed by the Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6206">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can see some merit in that, since the previous commission did provide secretariat services to COAG&mdash;I think&mdash;and a couple of others. But I would like the minister to explain to the committee why the government believes it would not be possible for that to be done under the Labor Party's amendment. Subclause (e) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to undertake, on its own initiative, research about matters relating to industry and productivity</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I suppose there is a legitimate fear that, if you let the commission loose to go wherever it likes and to do whatever it likes in regard to industry and productivity matters, you will be letting a tiger out to roam at will. I do not know why the government suggests that this subclause ought to be there, unless it is because it is thinking about the new functions the Productivity Commission will be taking on. I would like to ask the minister and Senator Sherry about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, this legislation is doing away with EPAC, BIE and the Industry Commission and putting them all into the Productivity Commission. Subclause (e) means that the functions of the previous bodies will be able to be exercised by the Productivity Commission. That is something that does, on reflection, concern me about the opposition's amendment. That amendment would so confine the commission as to preclude it from performing the functions of EPAC, BIE and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear from Senator Sherry on that. If you are going to allow the Productivity Commission to perform those functions, I see that as a problem about that amendment. If the desire was to see the previous functions of those mentioned bodies performed by the Productivity Commission, the amendment by the Labor Party might be too constraining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In regard to (f), it says the functions of the commission are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to promote public understanding of matters relating to industry and productivity</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister might address this question: is that its function? I suppose it can be said that the old productivity department used to do that. We used to have productivity councils and the like that used to promote public understanding in matters relating to industry and productivity. But I would have thought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Productivity Commission's work is fairly well cut out, particularly if you are to allow them to do what is contained in (e), and to enjoin them to do what is contained in (f): to promote public understanding of matters relating to industry and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the minister to address that. While I am fortunate enough to have on my staff a former very senior officer in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism&mdash;or the Department of Productivity as it was; they changed their names an awful lot in those days&mdash;I am just wondering whether the minister might address himself to those particular questions that I have asked.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy Chairman, I will address some remarks to those points. The effect of what the Labor Party is proposing quite clearly would restrict the Productivity Commission's functions to inquiries. We think that is overly restrictive. We do not think it is in Australia's interests to set up a commission which, if the Labor Party had its way, would not even be able to do what the Industry Commission under Labor was able to do. In fact&mdash;and I would have to check on this&mdash;even EPAC and BIE would have had broader powers than these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine used the florid language of `letting a tiger loose' in relation to the commission being able to undertake, of its own initiative, research on other matters. Senator Harradine, you said that this is like setting a tiger free. Having a tiger running around the country perhaps is not in the public interest, certainly from a public safety point of view. But we think that allowing a commission that has these objectives, of its own initiative, to undertake matters that look at industry and productivity is a worthwhile thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Industry Commission can do this at the moment. I think, from memory, EPAC used to be able to do that too. Certainly, to ensure basically that the Productivity Commission has to go to the Treasurer or send him a brief to say, `We propose to do some research on this industry' or `that industry' or `that productivity issue,' and for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6207"> the Treasurer to have to decide whether or not the commission should undertake that project, is extremely inefficient; quite frankly, it is a waste of the scarce time of the Treasurer. As I have been reminded, the commission can only make recommendations, anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, to use your analogy of the tiger being cut loose and the gates being opened on its cage, in my view Labor's amendments would not only put the tiger in a very tight cage but also shoot it with a tranquilliser dart. I do not think you would want a Productivity Commission that is so restricted in its functions that it would lie with glazed eyes on the bottom of a cage waiting for advice from the Treasurer about when it might get up and do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition believes that the functions set out in part 2 of the bill are sensible. They reflect the coalition's policy announcement that we would incorporate the existing functions of the Industry Commission, the BIE and EPAC into a Productivity Commission. What we have done here is to enumerate those functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, in your comments you talked about productivity councils and the like. I think it is quite appropriate that the commission have the functions which are described in part (f) in relation to promoting understanding of these issues. But, furthermore, one would hope that productivity issues are promoted by a whole range of other organisations, including trade unions&mdash;which I know they could do and have done in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Productivity should be seen as something that is not a dirty word. It should be something that is seen as a way of helping to generate economic growth, economic development and employment. It should not be seen as a way of slashing jobs or whatever. It is a bit like entrepreneurship. We got a pretty nasty name in the 1980s, but entrepreneurship is a very good thing for an economy, as is productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think for a Senate particularly to take away this function from a commission not only would constrain the commission when it got set up but also would send a terrible message to the Australian people saying, `We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> don't want the commission to promote this; we don't want it to be able to undertake research in these matters.' I really do wonder at the motives of those moving this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I think Senator Campbell&mdash;and I will be charitable&mdash;has inadvertently misled the Senate by saying that the powers we propose for the Productivity Commission are even less than those that existed under the old Industry Commission. I have a copy of the old Industry Commission Act here and, in fact, looking at it, what we are inserting I think is identical to what is contained therein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great problem or concern we have, Senator Harradine&mdash;and I have reiterated this over and over again&mdash;is that we believed in a split, competitive model: three different organisations, with three different functions, responsibilities, reporting to different ministers. If we are taking this analogy that the Productivity Commission or the Industry Commission is the tiger, in respect of the Productivity Commission the tiger exists as before. The tiger is on a leash. It is let loose occasionally. It slashes and burns. We do not like some of the results. But you can pull it back into line by ensuring that its functions and guidelines are controllable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we make the analogy that EPAC is the elephant and BIE is the lion, and you combine all three together, we have a horrendous beast indeed. It has no leash at all, particularly when it is under the direction of the Treasurer. Also, effectively, considering the accountability we had previously with the other three organisations, with BIE reporting to the industry minister, and EPAC to the Prime Minister, I am sure that the industry minister, Mr Moore&mdash;although I have never seen any statement from him&mdash;would be less than happy at what has happened to the BIE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government wants to narrow the various diverse and, in many cases, very important independent reports which were brought down under the three previous organisations, and if it wants to combine those organisations, we will not be happy with that. If, at the end of the day, we are to support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6208"> this legislation, we want to ensure that the tiger is as controlled as before. I think Senator Harradine would understand that, if you combine three different organisations, with all of their previous powers and responsibilities, the effective outcome is much greater. The authority that it has is much greater than the power and authority which the three individual organisations had previously. That really is the essence of Labor's concerns with the government's approach to the Productivity Commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some points that Senator Sherry raised. The government fundamentally disagrees with the concept that we are narrowing the advice. Any assessment of the amount of economic advice that is available now compared with the early 1980s, when I watched EPAC being formed, for example, totally avoids the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number and quality of independent economic advisory organisations and other forms of economic advice to government. That is a fact. I flippantly said&mdash;but on a half&hyphen;serious note&mdash;that most of the people who go to these organisations have either come from EPAC, or BIE, or Treasury or other spheres of government or quasi&hyphen;government organisations, because economic advice has become a most contestable marketplace now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would seek to make is that the power and authority of a body like the Productivity Commission, or any other organisation in terms of economic advice, will not be created because of its functions or anything else that can be made by the creator of the organisation. It will come down to the quality of its work, the quality of its contribution to the public debate and the effectiveness of its advice. We cannot create an organisation out of this place and give it power and authority. It can only do so in this area by building its own credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry referred to the powers under the existing Industry Commission Act. The point I made&mdash;and I did not seek to mislead the Senate; I sought to inform the Senate&mdash;was that the Industry Commission undertakes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the functions that are described in the functions of the commission section already. The Industry Commission has used a very wide definition of the incidental power in doing its work. The bill seeks to reflect the reality as it stands at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make, if Senator Sherry is to be taken seriously in relation to wanting EPAC to be regarded as an independent, vigorous, strong and powerful voice of economic advice, is that EPAC's role and function ran down under Labor, particularly over the last couple of years. Senator Sherry would have read that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> towards the dying days of the Keating government, where people from EPAC and former people from EPAC said that their role had been virtually gutted in the last couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point is that the BIE never had any sort of statutory base. I want to reinforce the fact that there is plenty of advice out there these days, probably more under this government than there was in the final years of the Keating government. Every time the Keating government needed to get a policy invigoration, it used to have a panic meeting and say, `Let's have a One Nation' or `Let's have a Working Nation'. It would create an enormous flurry of midnight activity to come up with the next policy document, finding ways to spend billions of dollars to churn people through unemployment streams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time that the coalition has been in government, we have sought advice from quite serious independent inquiries, such as the Wallis financial systems inquiry, to which the government has responded today, the Mortimer inquiry and Professor Goldsworthy's inquiry into information technology. The whole scene of economic advice and industry advice to government has changed significantly since the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to reform the current regime by bringing together advice into an efficient and effective modern economic advisory commission for this government in the guise of the Productivity Commission. We think saving $22.5 million in the process is an appropriate way to do it. We do not want to see that commission restricted by limiting its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6209"> functions in the way that the opposition have proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have two brief comments. I want to reiterate my concern that, if you combine the powers of three previous organisations&mdash;even if we accept Senator Campbell's point that EPAC was run down&mdash;you will ultimately have a body with much greater power than the individual powers of the three previous bodies that it is replacing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not yet commented on the new subsection 1 and subsection 2 to which we have added `matters relating to industry development and productivity'.

With this organisation we are seeking to put a much stronger emphasis for the Productivity Commission on industry development&mdash;not simply productivity but industry development and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of additional policy guidelines that we will get to shortly with respect to issues such as growth in employment in regional areas, and promotion of regional development. We believe that in such a new organisation, and given the current significant economic restructuring that is occurring, particularly in rural and regional areas&mdash;and particularly in my home state of Tasmania&mdash;the Productivity Commission should have a much more significant emphasis on industry development and productivity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be very long. Last night I did mention to the committee that it is important to have independent advice on economic matters, productivity matters, et cetera, from a source not under the control of the Treasury. The Treasury is a great department of the Public Service&mdash;perhaps a key, if not the key, department&mdash;and I respect the huge number of officers in that department who have the relevant expertise and are beavering away on matters of great importance to this nation. Mind you, I have got a question for tomorrow which perhaps throws some of that in doubt, but we will wait until then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with what has been said around the chamber that there is a need for a diversity of views and advice to government on these particular matters. I indicated last night that although the Industry Commission reports to the Treasurer, it does take views which are quite different from Treasury's views. I think I mentioned on that occasion the question of cost recovery for regulatory agencies. I have a copy of a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Regulation and its Review, 1994&hyphen;95</EMPHASIS>, which was undertaken by the commission. It goes quite effectively and deeply into the matter and it comes down with advice which appears to me, on the face of it, to be somewhat different from some of the advice that ministers have received from Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some stages, of course, Treasury's advice to ministers would be the advice that the ministers accept and, on other occasions, other advice. But what does worry me overall is the problem we might get into in that, with the abolition of EPAC and BIE and the ability they had of giving separate advice to ministers&mdash;and to different ministers at that&mdash;we are not going to have that now. Obviously the Labor Party amendments are not going to retain either EPAC or BIE. What concerns me is that unless we have the commission performing the functions that EPAC and BIE were able to perform, we are going to open the way for the suggestion that Treasury has the field on its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite obviously other departments will have their say about industry policy and productivity policy; there is no doubt about that. As has been said by other senators, various groups&mdash;industry groups, the trade union movement and others&mdash;will obviously have their say. But I feel that if 6(1)(b) does not come within the scope of the Labor Party's amendment&mdash;if, for example, the commission is unable to provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies as directed by the minister&mdash;then it ought to be there, because these services are currently undertaken.

Could I ask: did EPAC or the Bureau of Industry Economics have the same powers in respect of part 7, which relates to offences? I assume they did not, but I would just like confirmation that neither EPAC nor BIE had what we consider to be very extensive powers. I know the old Industry Commission did, but as I understand it we are conferring the same powers of the old Industry Commission on a new body which has much greater scope and functional responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The BIE could not have had them because it was not a statutory body. I do not have advice on EPAC, but I would doubt it. I can see how it relates to functions; I can see how you could draw a bow. I think it would be appropriate to speak about powers. But as I understand it we are conferring the same powers on this body that the Industry Commission had. EPAC had only 10 people in March 1996 and probably would not have had the people to implement the power.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to point out to Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Harradine that this highlights our concern. We are effectively conferring the old functions of BIE and EPAC&mdash;or most of them&mdash;onto a new body, in combination with the Industry Commission which is going into the Productivity Commission. In the course of doing that, Senator Harradine, the old Industry Commission, by incorporating the functions of the previous two organisations other than the Industry Commission, will be able to exercise its method of operation powers under part 7, for example, in a greatly enhanced form because of greatly enhanced functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst some offences would be considered reasonable in respect of the operation of the Industry Commission, would they have been considered reasonable in respect of the operation of EPAC or the BIE, whose functions we are largely transferring to the Productivity Commission? With a greatly enhanced functional responsibility in addition to the old Industry Commission, they will be able to exercise powers in respect of hindering or disrupting the commission; intimidation; notice to persons to provide information and documents; summons to persons to attend hearings; refusal to answer questions or produce documents; preservation of the privilege against self&hyphen;incrimination; and false or misleading evidence or information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I asked the question of Senator Campbell. I do not believe that organisations such as the BIE and EPAC, that are being replaced, effectively having their functions transferred to the new Productivity Commission, should be able to exercise the sort of powers outlined in part 7. As I said earlier, it is a combination of three different organisations with vastly different functions and also with vastly different powers in respect of offences. As I said, a number of these offences may be appropriate in respect of the old Industry Commission, but I certainly do not think they are reasonable in the context of the functions that we appear to be giving approval to here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take the time of the committee unnecessarily. Could I just ask for some guidance about splitting the functions of the commission in the two parts of the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor will be supporting these amendments. I think Senator Murray outlined very adequately the reasons for this. From my previous responsibilities as parliamentary secretary in the primary industries portfolio, I know that if, for example, water reform issues were to be addressed by the Productivity Commission, given what I fear are the enormous problems we face in that industry, we would have to take into account the ecological sustainability of those reforms, and the same applies to anything that may be considered by the Productivity Commission. Part (e) of the amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the necessity for the benefits of productivity performance of industry to flow through to the Australian people in terms of increased employment and improved living standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Campbell talked about the necessity for trade unions to talk about the benefits of productivity. I think if the wider community is to understand and accept the benefits of productivity, and certainly Labor does, we should try to overcome some of the fear in the community about words like `productivity' and `efficiency'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, Senator Campbell, when I talk to people at a corner pub about productivity and efficiency, you would have thought I had poisoned their drink, as their eyes glaze over when I talk about these sorts of terms. I never start a speech by lauding productivity and efficiency when I am out talking to what I consider are Labor's constituency. It is a good way to end your life. And I am pretty sure you would get the same reaction from small business, farmers and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is jargon that is not commonly understood or appreciated, and I think that is unfortunate. I think that, if we and the Productivity Commission can at least reshape some of the debate by placing an appropriate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> emphasis on increasing employment and improved living standards that result from productivity, it will be a very substantial step forward in the debate that is occurring at present.</PARA></SPEECH>

If it is not possible for entities like the Productivity Commission to have heed to things like ecological sustainability, what is it we are saying they are there for?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ecological sustainability is not just about the environment. It is about being able to continue earning a living in the future&mdash;not just destroying what we have now. You would think that, along with the competitive pressures, those issues ought to be considered and that there are balances&mdash;and the balances are what you are going to get out of it. There is not much point in increasing productivity for the sake of it. This is what I think the Senate is saying at the moment: productivity should be reaching a certain end, and that is the improvement of things. If you have a book entry which appears to improve productivity but it has actually destroyed your natural capital, you have not actually gained anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess we are suggesting that the measures should be a step in the right direction rather than destroying either employment prospects or the ability for people to be able to enjoy their living and make a living in the future. That is what it is all about. As I say, you cannot keep putting it somewhere else, because there is nowhere else to go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the premise of Senator Margetts which is that on the face of it&mdash;she should read page 5 of the bill&mdash;we are trying to find places to hide this. Senator Margetts, please read subclause 8(e) of the bill, which says `to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Commission'. Please listen when I say we think that referring to ecologically sustainable development in the functions of the commission is not the right place to do so, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6214"> but it is in the guidelines. It is a matter of how you run it effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not hiding from the importance of environmental considerations. Senator Sherry made a very good point. Senator Sherry referred to issues relating to water rights I think in the context of when he was a parliamentary secretary. In relation to forestry, if we had looked at bringing some sensible economics into the ownership of forests and the allocation of resources within forests 30 years ago, we would not have the plundering of forests that we have at the moment. Forests have effectively been controlled by state&hyphen;owned monopolies for most of the history of Australia, and state&hyphen;owned monopolies do not allocate resources efficiently and they create ecological damage in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the return for the wood coming out of Giblett Block is probably not what is driving that process at the moment. Good economics can be good for the environment as well, and in many parts of Australia that does not occur. We do not hide from that. We know that efficiency and good economics can deliver good outcomes, and we have recognised it in&mdash;and Senator Margetts has not read them or refuses to&mdash;the general policy guidelines to the commission. They are mentioned quite explicitly on the very same page of the bill. We are not hiding it. We have put it in there in black and white, right up front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, in respect of your proposed addition of subclauses (d) and (e), what we are saying is that they will have to be re&hyphen;numbered because the last amendment we passed has wiped out 2(a), (b) and (c). You are proposing to add (d) and (e) so you will, if you want to make this correct, have to re&hyphen;letter those particular additions in relation to `ecologically sustainable' industry and also in relation to `the necessity for the benefits of productivity performance of industry to flow through to the Australian people in terms of increased employment and improved living standards'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, you know very well that is exactly what the government is on about. I have said that three or four times in this debate. Having productivity for productivity's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sake is just stupid. You do not pursue these sorts of economic terms for some sort of gratification. You do it to improve living standards and to improve employment, and there is a big political incentive to do that, as you know as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am suggesting to the chamber that the government would quite happily, to add emphasis to 8(1)(e)&mdash;`under general policy guidelines', add the two sections that Senator Murray proposes. We are quite happy to do that and I would foreshadow&mdash;with an indication of support&mdash;that I would be prepared to move in that way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very important amendment for the Labor opposition. As I have referred to in this debate on a number of occasions so far, we are combining the functions of three organisations into one. We have particular concerns about the flow&hyphen;on consequences of that; and we have dealt with the issue of contestable advice, so I will not go over that again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the general policy guidelines for the new Productivity Commission we believe that there should be, to some extent, a refocus of the old Industry Commission policy guidelines, particularly given this combination of the functions of the three previous organisations which, regrettably, the committee has agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very important reason is the new and emerging trend in the economy because of which, rather than seeing a slowdown in the pace of economic change, we are seeing it accelerate. Rather than people being relaxed and comfortable, as the Prime Minister said at the last election that he wished them to be&mdash;a bit like the little fairy coming down and waving the wand over the Australian electorate and saying, `Be relaxed and comfortable and the world will change tomorrow when a Liberal government is elected'&mdash;if anything, the uncertainty and the fear of change has gotten worse in the last year. In part that has been because of what has occurred as a consequence of the two budgets. That is another issue, but I think it is relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to rewrite clause 8, which involves the general policy guidelines to be followed by the commission. We believe that this is one of the great weaknesses of the current bill that the government is proposing. The government has completely neglected 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6217"> some very significant policy guidelines in the context of this combination of three organisations and in the context of the continuing accelerating change in the economy. We propose to insert what we believe are neglected policy guidelines. This policy neglect has been a consistent theme of the government since its election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the commission must give priority to encouraging the development and growth of Australian industry and to the avoidance of social and economic hardships arising from structural adjustment. We must recognise the interests of industries, employees and consumers. Also, the promotion of regional development is very important in the context of the economic change that is occurring. Of course, there was a time when probably the last socialist party in Australia, the National Party, were protecting the interests of regional development in this country.</PARA>

But, then, I think they have given up the ghost for regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that there is an emphasis on the promotion of regional development and, again, the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. I acknowledge that there is significant scepticism in the Australian community about the benefits of reduction in tariffs if Australia were to progress the reform of Australian industry by having a further reduction in tariffs. Continually we are confronted with arguments about what is occurring with our trading partners, particularly in the east Asian and north Asian regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor certainly does not believe in a process of continual reductions of tariffs down to zero. Labor is not a zero tariff party. It never has been and never will be. The place for tariffs is as part of an industry policy mix to allow industries to develop and grow. We have made reference to the recent Industry Commission interim report on textiles, cloth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing and footwear. In that context, what is just as important as the tariff barrier is the positive assistance offered to industry by, for example, the import credit scheme in the TCF area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are assistance programs on which the Industry Commission is absolutely unwavering in its advocacy of cutting, slashing and burning. I would regard myself as a relative economic rationalist, but even I was shocked by the evidence of Mr Kerr, the head of the Industry Commission, at a recent estimates committee. I do not want to be unduly harsh on him&mdash;in fact, he would probably be proud of the fact that I am referring to him in this debate&mdash;but I have never seen a person so zealous in advocating getting rid of all industry assistance and all tariffs&mdash;getting rid of it all.</PARA>

That has been signed off by the states. We do not think there should be another enhanced body with the sorts of functions, powers and responsibilities that this body has so far&mdash;and I hope does not have when we get to sections later on&mdash;delving into the areas of the states, territories and local government.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (6.27 p.m.)&mdash;I will make one observation and I will be brief. I am not sure, Senator Sherry, whether you are indicating that the rest of the proposal is okay. We probably will get to a vote on this. This is not to say that this makes it holy writ, but (c) is a direct transcription of the identical clause in the general policy guidelines to the Industry Commission legislation that the previous government enacted through this place in 1990. It is an exact transcription and an exact power that the Industry Commission has under its current general policy guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry is quite right: the competition process has improved discussions on competition productivity and competitive neutrality issues between the states and the Commonwealth. I give credit where it is due to the previous Prime Minister in moving that policy along. I think it was a very good initiative of the previous government and a great credit to the previous Prime Minister. But I do think that staying vigilant on these matters and the Productivity Commission having this within its general policy guidelines remain important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody who takes an interest in these matters would think that the problem has been solved. There is a long way to go in this area. The Commonwealth can do a lot in terms of reducing red tape and unnecessary regulation, which does not have a benefit, which does not stand up to any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis. The Commonwealth government can go a long way, but there is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done across the nation in other jurisdictions at different levels of government. To remove the provision that the previous government put into the Industry Commission legislation in 1990 would be giving some sort of indication&mdash;the Labor Party seems to be giving this indication now&mdash;that seven years down the track the work is over. The work has just begun. It was to Mr Keating and his government's credit that they commenced that competition policy work, bringing the states into this regime. But the work is not over. There is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rise tonight to speak to the Western Australian Fisheries Joint Authority report of July 1995 to 30 June 1996. Two areas are dealt with by the joint authority: the southern demersal gillnet and demersal long line managed fishery; and the joint authority northern shark fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response from the southern demersal gillnet and demersal long line managed fisheries are of concern. The fishery that I just mentioned deals with the stocks of whiskery, gummy and bronzed whaler sharks, and the report on page 4 clearly indicates that those sharks are overexploited. The stock assessment and projections of future catch indicate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that whiskery shark stocks are at about 24 per cent of their original biomass, and significant effort reductions are required to ensure their long-term viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gummy shark stocks are at about 45 per cent of their original biomass, with a continuing downward trend without significant effort reductions. Bronze whaler stocks are at approximately 65 per cent of their original biomass. Effort reductions, they suggest, are required in the joint authority; that is the catch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint authority for the northern shark fishery includes the area which straddles the north of Australia and parts of the Northern Territory. That is important because that is also an area which goes to the current outer limit of Australia's fishing zone. I will mention that in a little while. Page 7 of the report on the condition of the fishery says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little data upon which an accurate assessment of the stock could be based. However, domestic catch rates indicate that the fishery's biomass is below a sustainable level.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So in two areas quite apart from each other the indications are that the fishery is unsustainable. In relation to the research from the joint northern shark fishery, the sources come from the Taiwanese gill net fishery, catch and effort data from domestic operators and a CSIRO study coordinating the then Commonwealth department of primary industries and the state fisheries departments of Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many people are recognising that, as an industry and as a set of ecosystems, we have to be very careful about the way we manage fisheries and marine resources because they are not inexhaustible. It does ring warning bells in terms of other species, what is happening to those species, what Australia is doing in terms of agreements with other countries on catches and about the way we manage fishing stocks ourselves. There is still a lot of work to be done on fishing, resources, where breeding areas are and what we should be doing to make sure that that is a sustainable resource and that the ecosystem is sustainable. What are we going to do when we do not have fish any more?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6224">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention the northern shark fishery in particular. Whilst the warning bells are ringing there in terms of its unsustainability, that may well change for the worse because Australia has signed a joint seabed agreement with Indonesia. That is up for ratification at the moment. There will be an inquiry in relation to the bilateral treaty on seabed boundaries and I urge all those people interested in Australia's sustainable fishery and marine resources to look at the implications of the agreement between Australia and Indonesia which will mean that Australia's joint seabed will be different from what it is now. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I welcome this discussion paper entitled `Delivery of Primary Dispute Resolution Services in Family Law&mdash;August 1997', which has been presented to the parliament today by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). I congratulate him on this initiative. It is the culmination of some degree of work by the Attorney and his department after his initial address on this issue to the National Press Club on 15 October last year. In that address he expressed his keenness to maximise access to primary forms of dispute resolution, or what is normally known as alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation and counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of family law, it would be fair to say, is one that is always enveloped in a degree of emotion and personal devastation and where the practitioners involved are often dealing with the rawest of human emotions. Therefore, it is desirable to try to provide mechanisms for people to deal with those conflicts and difficulties within their lives out of the combative regime of the Family Court system and suggest that they go to other fora to explore the possibility of settlement and a dispute resolution between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document, which has been put before us by the Attorney&hyphen;General, basically canvasses a whole range of issues without coming 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to any final conclusions and in fact invites comments and submissions from our fellow Australians to have an input into this very important area of social concern. The closing date for submissions is 28 November 1997, so there is a good three&hyphen;month period in which people can make submissions. They can be sent to the Assistant Secretary, Courts, Tribunals and Administrative Law Branch, Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, Robert Garran Offices, National Circuit, Barton, ACT 2600.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In chapter 2 of the discussion paper the Attorney&hyphen;General deals with objectives for an improved structure. I think it is appropriate to quickly canvass the four major points that are highlighted as being necessary for such an improved structure. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal objectives for any reformed structure for the delivery of services to people dealing with relationship breakdown are essentially fourfold. Firstly, the structure should offer the greatest opportunity and encouragement for people to resolve their family disputes without recourse to litigation; secondly, services should focus on the needs of clients and provide equity of access; thirdly, service provisions should be opened up to a wide field of providers if this will ensure the delivery of higher quality and more flexible services; and, fourthly, expenditure of public funds on primary dispute resolution should be accountable to ensure high quality for clients and value for dollars spent.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I welcome the discussion in this paper of those four objectives and also the discussion of the importance of client focus in this very important area. Can I simply say that those of us who do spend time listening to and talking to the electorate would know that this area of alternative dispute resolution in family law matters is one that is of great interest to the general public and, might I say, in relation to some of the discussions we have had in recent times, somewhat more prioritised in the community's mind than privacy, cross&hyphen;media ownership or issues of that nature. I conclude by congratulating the Attorney&hyphen;General on this excellent initiative. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to seek the incorporation of a letter into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . The letter is written by Martin Williams and involves the death of his wife, Esther Wild, who died on 17 April this year. All honourable senators who participated&mdash;as we all did&mdash;in the euthanasia debate here in this chamber would know both of those names.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Esther Wild was the patient who had asked for euthanasia from Dr Nitschke and she was the patient who was not able to have euthanasia administered by Dr Nitschke because of the vote taken here in the Senate. Martin Williams, a man whom I respect enormously, is a typical Australian working man&mdash;a decent bloke, devoted absolutely to his partner and a man who suffered enormously, as she did, in the last days of her life. She, as I said, wanted to avail herself of the euthanasia machine of Dr Nitschke and could not do so. Of course, this was all highly publicised at the time. Dr Nitschke administered to Esther Wild over a period of some four days a series of drugs which kept her in a largely comatose state, although she revived, unplanned, on a number of occasions and finally died after four days. This point is made in the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administration of these drugs over that period of four days appears to have been perfectly legal. Certainly no action has been taken against Dr Nitschke and, indeed, public statements by Kevin Andrews and other doctors at the time indicated that the administration of drugs in this fashion was, in fact, legal and, indeed, moral. But the administration of such drugs over a period of an hour, for example, or even 10 minutes, was not&mdash;which is the point made in the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I do want to make clear is that the incorporation of this letter tonight has nothing whatever to do with the recent Northern Territory election. Indeed, Senator Tambling and I agreed publicly that euthanasia had little or no effect on the result&mdash;which is what I believe, despite the fact that it was raised during the campaign.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the letter is being tabled quite simply is this: Martin Williams came to see me after the death of his wife and asked me whether I would be prepared to present to this Senate a personal message from him regarding the death of his wife. I said&mdash;as I would to any other constituent of mine in the Northern Territory&mdash;that, providing it was in accordance with standing orders and proprieties of this chamber, I would be happy to do so. Martin Williams is well aware that I do not share his position on this issue. But, as I said during the debate itself, although I do not agree, I absolutely respect his position on this, and it would be utterly presumptuous of me to even pretend that I would understand completely what he and his wife went through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you read this letter you will see why I am seeking to have it incorporated. Frankly, the reason is that I do not feel it appropriate for me to read it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: it is an intensely personal letter. Can I say, for the advice of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), who is at the table, that I did seek permission from the government whip, who read the letter prior to the debate, and that permission has been given. I seek leave to have Mr Williams's letter incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A drug induced coma was achieved to Esther's benefit, since euthanasia was now only available by way of double effect or slow euthanasia, although the Senate would deny this as any form of euthanasia but a proper procedure of palliative care.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to one of the people in this parliament who has been part of the behind&hyphen;the&hyphen;scenes theatre of the parliament. Often, when we see members of parliament, we forget that behind the scenes is the army of people in the Table Office and Hansard, all the people who maintain the infrastructure of this building and those people who offer us advice. Tonight, it is Professor Douglas Whalan to whom I want to pay tribute. Professor Whalan has announced his retirement and I want to take this opportunity because his retirement took effect as of 31 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to say a little about the committee on which Professor Whalan mainly served, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He did spend some time on the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The regulations and ordinances committee, of which Senator Collins was once chairman and of which I have been a member for some considerable period of time, is a committee like none other in the parliament. It is a special committee. People go on it and stay on it for a very long while. I think it is one of the most interesting committees in parliament. It has been copied in other Westminster parliaments because it protects the rights of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was set up in 1932 when academics and politicians felt that regulations and other subordinate legislation was not being properly scrutinised. It has a long and proud tradition of protecting the rights of individuals, and it has never ever lost when it has moved a disallowance of a motion. It is one of the most careful committees, but it relies enormously on the legal advice that it gets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Douglas Whalan has been legal adviser to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for about 15 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6228"> years and one month. He was born in New Zealand. He was a barrister and solicitor of the high courts of Australia and New Zealand and the Supreme Court of the ACT. Professor Whalan was also dean of the Faculty of Law and chairman of the academic board of the Australian National University. On retiring early, he was appointed emeritus professor at the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Whalan has been the independent legal adviser to the committee since August 1982 and was the acting legal adviser to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for 13 months during 1989-91. He also prepared special reports for the committee, he gave other advice and, when required, attended meetings of the committee. In fact, he attended most of the meetings in the last few years that I have been a member. I was also a member in the first three years of my parliamentary career, and he attended meetings then. He has also advised the Australian Capital Territory Scrutiny of Bills and Subordinate Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was awarded an Order of Australia in the Australia Day honours list in 1994. One of the reasons he received that award was for his contribution to this parliament through his advice. I remember with great fondness when he was the token male, as he called himself, when a delegation went to what I think was the third Commonwealth delegated legislation conference in London. The delegation was made up of former Senator Giles, former Senator Bronwyn Bishop, Senator Crowley, me, Anne Lynch, the deputy clerk, and Professor Whalan as our adviser. We thought he was particularly game coming to London with all of us. We had some enormous fun at the meetings and also after the meetings. I remember one particularly wonderful night when we sat in a London pub and entertained a number of people with our Australian stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to remark upon the diligence that Professor Whalan has applied. He has been assiduous in applying attention to detail. We estimated that he has produced 771 reports and he has read and dealt with about 18,000 instruments, regulations, determinations, ordinances, plans of management and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a plethora of other delegated legislated instruments. Some of them are inches high and incredibly boring. He has written these reports in enormous detail. Not one single thing would have slipped through his attention to that detail in protecting the rights of people, to make sure there is not a reversal of onus of proof and to ensure that people's rights have not been infringed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice we have been given and received has been enormously welcomed and valued and ought to be recognised by all the Australian people because at some stage every single person in this country is affected by a piece of subordinate legislation. It is because of Douglas Whalan's diligence and because of his attention to detail that they are most probably less likely to be caught up in unintended consequences of that legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Collins. I know you will support me in everything I am saying. You do not always do that but I think in this case you will be. I used to enjoy reading Professor Whalan's reports. The committee staff would come in with five or six huge folders on a Tuesday afternoon and we were supposed to have looked at the reports and the relevant legislation by 8.30 on Thursday morning. One of the things that drove and enthused me to read these reports was the little gems that I would find in Professor Whalan's reports. In one report he wrote that he had at least found the spelling error. He said that at least that demonstrated that he had read all the regulations or the particular piece of delegated legislation. When we laughed about something he said in the report, I think we could all say that at least it showed that we had read his report. I used to read his reports with great delight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to share one thing that was written about Professor Whalan in an annual report. Then, if I have time, I will give one or two examples of what he said in his reports. The 1985-86 report of the committee&mdash;I do not think anything has changed, except that it should be magnified 100 times&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee records its appreciation of the assistance it receives from Professor Douglas Whalan, of the Faculty of Law, Australian National 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6229"> University, who as the Committee's Legal Adviser scrutinises and advises on material that comes before it. The depth of legal skill and acumen which he brings to this task, after a life time devoted to academic scholarship and university administration, are an immense contribution to the quality, the consistency and the effectiveness of the Committee's work. However, those are paradoxically the least of his attributes in the Committee's eyes. Even more important than legal ability of a high order, is the capacity to assess and balance in a mature and responsible way the vital demands of equity, fairness, justice, personal rights, personal liberties and legislative and parliamentary propriety, against the competing needs and requirements of reasonable law enforcement, judicial procedures and proprieties and efficient public administration. The Committee admires Professor Whalan's forensic skills, his sense of fair play and his deep commitment to the important work of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think every committee report from 1985-86 until now could say `Hear, hear' to that 100 times over. Just to give an example of the wonderful humour of this man, let me read from a couple of the reports. I have a report from 9 July 1992. The second point is headed `A tiny error of "principle"' and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Service Determination 1992/49 amends the principal determination in relation to a number of expense related allowances such as tool allowances and meal allowances as a result of an award decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">And I point out that he has underlined `le'. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is slightly odd as the other 10 sub&hyphen;paragraphs in paragraph 4 all have "Principal Determination".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was headed `A tiny error of "principle"'. In one of the other reports, he reminded us of some complicated drafting&mdash;and he was talking about one piece of complicated drafting, but referred to one that he had already commented on some time before. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing wrong with these regulations that I can detect other than complicated drafting. When I compare the drafting here with that in the famous "Nuts" provision, I think its reputation is put at risk by the new regulation 7A(2) which provides . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have drawn attention to the enormous job losses this country has suffered as a direct result of the decisions of this government since they came to office. As the Senate will be aware, the Democrats gave notice yesterday of an inquiry we would like to see into the impact of public sector job losses on regions. We know, for instance, that COSBOA recently reported that in Cooma in New South Wales 361 jobs were lost from the public sector. Those job losses resulted in 180 families moving out of the area and $11.8 million also going from the region. I travel around the country on a regular basis and hear stories about the declining economies of small, medium and large towns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that Australians are crying out for something to be done about the loss of jobs, which appears in many communities to be simply unstoppable. Whether it is the closure of banks, state or local government agencies closing down, Commonwealth services going, or simply a result of the obsession that both governments and the private 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6230"> sector seem to have with downsizing or offshore manufacturing or contracting out government services to large overseas companies, the feeling is that this has taken over our entire country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk tonight about the fact that our government seems to be trotting along obediently behind multinational consultants and accountancy firms and appears to be doing their every bidding. We are getting down to core business; we are steering not rowing; we are shedding ourselves of staff whose work could possibly be done from outside government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arbitrary decision by the government to tender out IT services of every government agency and the arbitrary way in which budget cuts to those agencies assumed a very consistent level of saving was made regardless of the impacts on service or even any real or reliable data on the likelihood of those savings actually being achieved. There is much that will be said in this place about IT outsourcing. As the Senate will be aware, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is currently inquiring into this very issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter I want to deal with tonight is the total lack of interest of this government in seeing that Australia's IT companies have a fighting chance to compete in what is going on here at present. It seems to me that the government has been led down the path of competitive neutrality and into that realm of global inevitability&mdash;the inevitability of multinationals dominating forever computer technology and the inevitability that Australia will not and cannot be part of that scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, during estimates last month, went to some lengths to press the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) and departmental heads on the matter of government contracts in the IT area and opportunities afforded to Australian companies. He asked whether, all things being equal in the tenders, the federal government would be biased towards awarding the contract to an Australian company rather than one from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that a few years ago, in perhaps more enlightened times, such a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> question would have been answered with some enthusiasm to the effect that policy was to support local industry. But not so now. Minister Kemp informed the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government's goal is to encourage and expand Australian and New Zealand industry's role in the global environment by promoting a competitive domestic environment for businesses and, in doing this, agencies should recognise, in assessing value for money and whole of life costs, the commercial and practical advantages of doing business with competitive Australian and New Zealand industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a bit of doubletalk, but I think what that means is that we will make things competitive at home and just hope for the best. The government, he said, would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . investigate Australian and New Zealand industry capability to provide fair opportunity for suppliers to compete.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This does not seem to me to be very strong encouragement for Australian industry. Mr Godfrey, in response to the `all things being equal' question, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would not be biased towards any tenderer in the evaluation of a tender document. We would have to consider whether there was some way of separating them, and the overall effect of the Commonwealth might then tip the advantage towards the Australian firm.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Might, I stress. When asked whether or not it mattered to the government whether it is an Australian or a foreign company, Mr Godfrey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the process for evaluation of procurements is established on value for money. If it is not listed as one of those evaluation criteria, you have to divorce any personal views from that evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In this current climate, let us look at the issue which came to the attention of the Senate today and which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  yesterday. The issue is about PC suppliers and the difficulty Australian PC suppliers are having in competing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use as an example Ipex. Ipex is a 100 per cent Australian owned information technology company, and it employs 320 people in Australia and another 170 in Israel, Germany, Ireland, Thailand and New Zealand. It is not an enormous organisation but it is a growing one. It is not a multinational in the normal sense of the word but it certainly is one which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6231"> is expanding beyond our shores and making itself into a global player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company was started in 1982 and, as I understand it, has returned a profit every year since its inception. It has no debt and it runs on cash flow. All elements of research and development, quality control and product support are undertaken locally&mdash;here in Australia. In 1996, Ipex was the third largest PC and server supplier in Australia. Ipex supplies only the corporate and government marketplace and, I am told, it has been the largest supplier to Australia's marketplace over the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is that Ipex does not qualify as a PC supplier in the specification drawn up by the Australian Customs Service for IT services. The specification operates on a model drawn up by the Gartner Group, a multinational consultant organisation, and it requires that a supplier should produce a minimum of 250,000 units per annum. The model requires organisations to comply with a number of metrics&mdash;finance performance, product reliability, quality control and formal review processes&mdash;and what are known as tier 1 and tier 2 include this minimum number of units. The minimum number was developed in the US, which is of course reaching an enormous market compared with that in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of units is the amount which Gartner would argue is the minimum required to gain the leverage to produce quality consistent product. But of course the problem is that the model considers only supply of product worldwide or in major regions such as in Europe. It does not consider smaller regions or specific countries. The weakness in this model is that it is essentially an American model. It does not take into account regional diversity, regional requirements or regional strengths of local manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They would say the model should be used in conjunction with local requirements, market share and strength of local vendors. The problem is that here in Australia departments such as the Australian Customs Service are not doing so and the effect is that the model is being used to prevent local vendors from even taking part in the tendering process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a clause in the specification for the ASC which allows for another industry, and that could be approved by a contract manager. But in this case no contract manager was ever appointed and there was no opportunity to change this minimum requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government might argue that the purpose of the model is to minimise the risk to organisations when making purchases, but that is not in fact reflected in some of the recent occurrences with overseas organisations. I have a long list of those organisations that have failed to supply PCs and other equipment in a consistent manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry argues that, if this kind of approach to IT were used in, say, the banking industry, it would produce quite ridiculous results. It would mean that in this country the government would not be able to deal with our local banks and it would have to use overseas organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish quickly by saying that the industry is calling for a number of factors. It wants to see any supplier being able to produce, financial stability, market presence, local expertise, previous experience, industry initiatives and development, export potential, and quality of products and services. Those seem to me to be very worthwhile measures that ought to be replaced by the sorts of arrangements that we currently have which clearly discriminate against our local suppliers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6231"><TITLE>Newcastle and the Hunter Region: Job Losses</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in this debate to make a progress report to the Senate on the plans of the federal government for Newcastle and the Hunter region following the announcement by BHP to downsize its steel making operations in that city. This will lead to the loss of 2,500 direct jobs within the next two years and over 1,000 additional contract positions, with an estimated flow&hyphen;on effect of a further 3,000 jobs. To give the Senate an example of the impact of this on one area, in the city of Lake Macquarie there are likely to be over 900 displaced workers and their families resulting from this announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6232">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the decision by BHP to cease steel making in Newcastle has given this region a priority in terms of the national interest. Quite appropriately, the people of the region have looked to the federal government for leadership and direction in relation to the future of the region as it refashions its economic base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to report to the Senate that the Howard government has provided and continues to provide leadership to Newcastle and the Hunter region. On 16 and 17 July this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a highly publicised trip to Newcastle and the Hunter. The two-day visit focused the nation's attention on the current plight of this region, and John Howard used the authority of his prime ministership to wipe out the national perception that this decision by BHP had crippled the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having identified Newcastle with steel for so long, people probably do not realise how enormously diverse the economy of Newcastle is with, for example, its equine industry and the horse studs in the Upper Hunter&mdash;we have more of those than the Kentucky bluegrass country&mdash;and the winery industry. It has the best wine growing region in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting some conflict on this view from one of my colleagues, but in the Hunter we will claim that. Certainly the recreational areas of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie have so much to offer. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people do not often realise is that BHP is not really the biggest employer in Newcastle; it is actually the Hunter Area Health Service, followed by education, BHP and a very wide range of wholesale and retail outlets. The city and the region employ 70 per cent of its work force in the services industry. I just say that to put this problem, which is indeed a major one, in perspective. If you lose that many jobs out of any region, it is a major problem. I just point out to the Senate the resilient nature of the region.</PARA>

Let us go back to your government&mdash;and I assume you are talking about things like the textile, clothing and footwear industries&mdash;and look at the absolute devastation it wreaked on these industries over a period of 15 years. It dropped tariffs from 105 per cent to 35 per cent over 13 years. There was absolutely massive downsizing in that area. We have shown through our decision on car tariffs that we are a little more sensitive than the last Labor government was and that is now reaping extra investment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised you brought that up because John Howard showed during his visit on the 16th and the 17th that this government is prepared to focus on regions that are having difficulty, and he has signalled support in a wide range of industries in an area that has been developing a very broad&hyphen;based economy over the last 200 years. I would like to make the point to the Senate that last week Newcastle turned 200. There are not too many areas of Australia that have actually done that, and I think Sydney's is the only region. This is the second&hyphen;oldest region in Australia. It is a region that has experienced many hardships, like the earthquake in 1989 in which 12 people were killed and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6233"> 32,000 buildings were damaged. But like that event, the earthquake created by BHP will be coped with by the people in the local region and they will come through that like they have come through many problems in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to show you how the city has turned things around in the last 50 years, if you look back to what the region had in 1947 it was at that time called the `dirtiest city in Australia'. It boasted no art gallery, university or conservatorium. The port was on the verge of closure due to the silting&hyphen;up of the harbour. But at this time of the city's bicentenary, many of these negatives have been turned around and it is now one of the cleanest industrial cities in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has the largest regional university in Australia with world renowned reputations in several disciplines, including medicine and engineering, and one of the largest graduate business schools in the country. It has many successful art galleries, a symphony orchestra, a professional theatre company and a conservatorium. It has&mdash;and this surprises many people&mdash;in terms of cargo bulk handling the second&hyphen;largest port in Australia, second only to Sydney. So, much has been achieved over the last 50 years up to the point of the bicentennial celebration last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the whole thing has been clouded by BHP's announcement. Certainly, even though BHP is ceasing steelmaking in the country, as the region faces its third century there are many opportunities for it to move forward. It is a great pity that the Labor Party, in its reaction to this closure, has not looked towards this forward looking vision for the Hunter&mdash;as exemplified by the announcements of the Howard government&mdash;but has tended to look back. It has wallowed in the past. It has called on BHP to continue steelmaking in Newcastle using grossly outdated plant and so losing millions of dollars each month. That certainly would not have worked.</PARA>

On top of that, in conjunction with the New South Wales government and with BHP, we are announcing another $25 million for specific projects to give this region a real boost.

The scheme aims to achieve a gender balance, participation of Aboriginal young people and an intake of school leavers and unemployed young people, on the basis that many would gain employment ultimately within the South Australian Government. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The scheme has received significant Commonwealth funding in the past. From 1995/96 to 1996/97 the Commonwealth committed up to $9M to the scheme for the recruitment of 1500 trainees. The exact amount payable is not yet known as the funding period continues until the last trainee has completed his or her traineeship, which will be April 1998. In addition, the Commonwealth has recently agreed to provide up to $2.5M in 1997/98 for a further 500 commencements.2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) An approach was made by the (then) Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education, the Hon Dr Bob Such, to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in October 1996 about the expansion of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) According to the SA Office for the Commissioner for Public Employment (OCPE), the scheme is an ongoing initiative to increase the representation of young people in the South Australian public sector and to address training and employment issues for young people and has no specified term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The SA OCPE reports that, since its inception in December 1993, the scheme has resulted in employment and training positions for more than 4000 young people. The Federal Government has been involved in the scheme since February 1996 when the recruitment of 1500 young people into the SA public sector commenced, with many of those trainees still in training. A further 500 trainees are expected to be recruited from September 1997 to April 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The SA Office for the Commissioner for Public Employment considers the scheme to have been very successful. The SA OCPE considers it to be the single most significant initiative for youth training and employment through the South Australian Government which complements other State initiatives through the South Australian Department of Employment, Training and Further Education (DETAFE). The SA OCPE expects up to 80% of trainees recruited under the scheme to remain in employment at the completion of their training, either in the South Australian public sector or in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The Federal Government has agreed to assist the South Australian Government in respect of a further 500 trainees. Any further representation from the South Australian Government will be considered at the appropriate time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Federal Government has agreed to support the scheme in respect of a further 500 trainees. The Commonwealth, through the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has agreed to contribute up to $2.5M for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The experience of the scheme in South Australia is of interest to the Federal Government and may provide a basis for further projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I assume that the honourable Senator is referring to the proposal by TNN Cairns Pty Ltd for a residential resort and marina development north of Yorkey's Knob at Caims, Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the prevention of serious environmental harm for the proposal rests with local and State Government authorities. The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over the site. Most of the development is to be located well outside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), which extends to the low water mark. A small component comprising possible dredging of a marina entrance channel and possible dredge spoil disposal is proposed within the GBRWHA. While no permissions are required from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Authority has been consulted as part of the State assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand from media reports that the development has been "mothballed" for 12 months. No dredging or spoil disposal below the low water mark has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Environmental impact assessments were undertaken by the local and State Governments in accordance with Queensland requirements at that time. Following an application for foreign investment by the proponent, the Foreign Investment Review Board designated Barrier Reef International Co Ltd as proponent for the proposal in accordance with the Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the then Minister for the Environment determined on 16 June 1995 that there was no requirement for a Commonwealth Environmental Impact Statement or a Public Environment Report. This was in view of assessment action undertaken by Queensland authorities. The Minister made recommendations to the then Assistant Treasurer on measures for environmental protection, including requirements for monitoring and reporting, control of acid sulphate soils, water quality control measures and measures to protect conservation values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) See my answer to (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Foreign investors are required to comply with the recommendations for environmental protection that attach to the foreign investment approval.</PARA>
