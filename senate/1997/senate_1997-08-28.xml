<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5890"> Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator Calvert</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>and <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME><FROM>(from nine citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1997 cotton production has achieved over $1.2 billion of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive studies will be undertaken in relation to economic viability. It is estimated that direct employment would be available to 3,000 people and 7,500 would benefit from indirect jobs. New business opportunities will be available for service and support industries and from improved public service and infrastructure expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be no direct cost to the state and the success of the project will result in $900 million of export income per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive studies will also be undertaken in social areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be greater family security because of future job opportunities generated for the younger generation and young people of the West Kimberley won't have to move to Perth for employment purposes as jobs would be available in the region. There would also be an added boost to the tourist and scenic value of the region in that tourists will be able to go on day trips to see how cotton is grown, harvested and processed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Studies will also be conducted in the areas of technology and environmental sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a climatic advantage for irrigation, and crops such as cotton, rice, sugar and wine grapes have been very successful Australian export industries.   
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5893">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As previously stated, the West Kimberley has abundant water and consistent high temperature that will allow a diverse range of other crops such as sugar, horticultural crops, and tropical fruits to thrive. And further processing opportunities will be examined for these crops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Kimberley pastoral industry will be boosted by the availability of feed from by products and rotational crops that may allow value adding through local meat processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to state that a research station (subject to the EIS) will be constructed in the West Kimberley and managed by CSIRO, Agriculture WA and WAI to research all agronomic and associated environmental aspects of production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the West Kimberley will be introduced to new sophisticated technologically advanced systems and this is expected to achieve new international benchmarks in environmentally sustainable agriculture. For example, the use of sub&hyphen;surface irrigation tape will be used to achieve maximum water use efficiency. Water applied `fertigation' application of nutrients and the development of the industry away from the Fitzroy River floodplain will avoid the use of flood irrigation and flood levee banks will not be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chemical applications have been reduced in the West Kimberley by the use of Monsanto INGARD transgenic cotton varieties, and the implementation of CSIRO's Insect Pest Management (IPM) technique is expected to also contribute to reduced chemical dependency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very important to understand that it is not proposed to grow cotton on the Fitzroy River flood plain, so there is no possibility of polluting the river with chemicals from cotton crops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trials of Roundup&hyphen;Ready plant varieties are expected to reduce herbicide applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive studies will also be conducted into the effects that the damming of the Fitzroy River will have on Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WAI's policy is to achieve a negotiated agreement with the traditional people; respecting their laws, customs and traditions. Studies will be undertaken in full consultation with Aboriginal representatives. I am advised that WAI have had cooperative discussions with the Kimberley Land Council about this project and that discussions are also being held with other interested Aboriginal groups such as with Dickie Skinner of the Council of Elders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, unemployment of indigenous people in the West Kimberley is of a very high level. Many Aborigines are dismayed by the current welfare dependency.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for this government's commitment to two initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is its commitment to lift the requirement for at least 10% of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program (IESIP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic school and a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic vet institution and for there to be a minimum of 5 students in a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expense of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also avoid the situation where there will be little or no benefit to individual students from the provision of small grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of indigenous students, but these students represent less than 10% of total enrolments, to qualify for funding under the act. Experience has shown that the 10% requirement has excluded some institutions from receiving supplementary funding in respect of their indigenous students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases, for the period up to 30 june 2000. The appropriations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5900"> for these years are in subsections 13B(4), (5), (6) and (7) in the principal act. Inclusion of a cost supplementation provision in the principal act will bring the program into line with other education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SEARCH AND RESCUE SERVICE) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 (AMSA Act), Air Services Act 1995 (Airservices Act) and Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Civil Aviation Act) to facilitate the amalgamation of the Commonwealth's civil maritime and aviation search and rescue coordination functions into one national centre. The bill also amends the AMSA Act to increase the number of ordinary members on the Board of AMSA and make the appointment of a Departmental officer to the Board discretionary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's civil search and rescue coordination functions are presently divided between state/territory Police Services, industry and volunteer groups and at the Commonwealth level, between two agencies, Airservices Australia (AA) and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of search and rescue coordination activities relies on successful communication between these agencies. One of the first acts of this government last year was to initiate an independent review into the costs and benefits that could arise from a rationalisation of the Commonwealth's civil search and rescue functions. The review was to also recommend on the best administrative organisational model and location of a search and rescue coordination centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review concluded that the present dual Commonwealth civil search and rescue coordination system lacks a clear and unified strategic and operational focus, with no clear accountability for systems failures. The report recommended the establishment of a single civil search and rescue coordination centre to be managed by AMSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister for Transport and Regional Development announced on 15 January this year the establishment of a new national centre for the coordination of civil maritime and aviation search and rescue. This centre will bring together the search and rescue coordination functions of AA and AMSA. The national centre, to be called "AusSAR, the Australian Search and Rescue Organisation", will be located in Canberra and managed on behalf of the Federal Government by AMSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Search and rescue functions will be better coordinated and more effective through improved communications and responsiveness under the new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centralised structure. This initiative will strengthen Australia's already formidable international reputation in search and rescue. Both AMSA and AA support this amalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the AMSA Act make clear that in addition to its present maritime search and rescue service, AMSA will also provide an aviation search and rescue service. The provision of the amalgamated service will be performed in a manner consistent with Australia's obligations under applicable international conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airservices Act will be amended to reflect the transfer of responsibility for aviation search and rescue to AMSA. AA will continue to manage any liabilities that arise out of its present provision of search and rescue services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Act will be amended to enable the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to continue to have a role in setting safety standards and making regulations relating to the performance of search and rescue services by aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA Board</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also increases the number of ordinary members on the AMSA Board from three to four given the increased responsibilities of AMSA and to enable the appointment of a member with aviation experience. This is consistent with the government's aim that members of Boards have relevant experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMSA Act will also be amended to make the appointment of a Departmental officer to the Board discretionary. This will provide the minister with the flexibility to appoint a Departmental officer for specific periods where particular expertise is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes arrangements for the transfer to AMSA of assets associated with AA's search and rescue function. The value of these assets is to be determined by the minister following independent valuation. The assets transfer will not be subject to capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional arrangements also enable the minister or his delegate to transfer rights under contracts from AA to AMSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A regulation&hyphen;making power will provide for regulations to be made in relation to transitional matters arising from the transfer of the search and rescue function from AA to AMSA.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE (PATHOLOGY SERVICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997 gives effect to several Government initiatives relating to Medicare benefits for pathology services. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5901">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill would allow the Governor&hyphen;General to make Regulations to give the Health Insurance Commission power to directly impose penalties for the less serious infringements relating to pathology. It is envisaged that the proposed system of penalty notices, operating in a similar manner to traffic infringement fines, would enable the Commission to deal more efficiently and expeditiously with these infringements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes an amendment to the licensing scheme for the collection of pathology specimens. It introduces a requirement that the owner of a licensed collection centre must at all times display a notice clearly visible from the outside, to let the public know that the centre is licensed. The bill increases the maximum penalty for infringement from $100 to $1000, to be in line with other penalties relating to collection centres. The intention of this is to provide a deterrent to the operation of unlicensed collection centres and to protect consumer interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the Act restricts pathology providers from entering into arrangements for the occupation of premises with medical practitioners or entrepreneurs, except for the establishment of licensed collection centres, accredited laboratories, or the rendering of professional services. The aim is to prevent arrangements that constitute inducements to medical practitioners. An amendment in this bill clarifies the wording of the provision to establish beyond doubt that professional services must be performed by the pathologist in person. In other words, the arrangement cannot be one where the medical practitioner receives payment for providing, for example, storage space to a pathologist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also seeks to streamline administration of approvals for accredited pathology laboratories, approved pathology practitioners and approved pathology authorities. These are renewed annually, or very three years in the case of the laboratories. Currently, Medicare benefits are not payable where these approvals lapse simply as a result of administrative carelessness on the part of the pathology provider, for example, posting the application forms a few weeks after they are due. This can result in major financial losses to the pathology provider and in patients being deprived of Medicare benefits. The amendment will allow backdating of approvals in limited circumstances, to ensure that Medicare benefit payments are not disrupted in instances that do not warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures we are introducing in this bill are important to the maintenance of the Pathology Agreement which was introduced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, and which limits pathology expenditure under Medicare to pre&hyphen;determined levels. They will strengthen the Agreement by reducing inappropriate practices which undermine its basis. They have the support of the pathology profession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill which the Senate is considering proposes to appropriate the funds and to issue the securities to effect Australia's membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, commonly known as the MIGA. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, signed the MIGA convention, which is contained in schedule 1 of the bill, on behalf of Australia on 30 September 1996. This act, though significant, did not attract much attention back in Australia. The reason for this was that his trip was the embarrassing first trip to the US for the new Treasurer&mdash;the trip where the world got to know Mr Costello as an indiscreet Treasurer, amongst some other characteristics that have become apparent in respect of his behaviour in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators will remember that the Treasurer had a meeting with the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Mr Alan Greenspan, wherein they discussed, amongst other things, the future prospects for US interest rates. Mr Costello then, very improperly, divulged the contents of that meeting and the market&hyphen;sensitive information arising from the meeting to a group of journalists. Mr Michael Stutchbury, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, correctly realised the significance of the Costello indiscretions and reported them on page 1. The rest is history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had the embarrassing scene of the Australian Treasurer trying desperately to disavow the report. Then a tape of the meeting surfaced, showing clearly that the Treasurer had fibbed in his earlier denials of the reported contents of the interview, where he

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressure became so great that the Treasurer had to cancel a planned press conference because of the huge international embarrassment he had become. That is very unfortunate in the context of this important piece of legislation we are considering now. The other events, which I have referred to, did overshadow his signing this very important agreement on behalf of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the headline from the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 3 October 1996 summed up the matter very well&mdash;`Costello gaffe echoes around the world'. We have recently seen the Treasurer's next foray into international affairs with the embarrassment at the South Pacific Forum economic ministers meeting. This time it was not loose lips that embarrassed the Treasurer but sloppy organisational practice. Again Australia's reputation is diminished because of amateurish procedures and incompetence. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Needless to say, the signing of the MIGA convention was overshadowed somewhat due to the Treasurer's indiscretions. However, the matter is finally before the Senate and the bill is supported by the Labor opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MIGA is an institution of the World Bank. It was established in 1988 by international convention. Its purpose is to foster foreign investment in developing countries and transitional economies by providing insurance against various risks and advisory services, such as legal advice, concerning the facilitation of foreign investment. These services complement the programs and activities of other international institutions such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MIGA was created on the premise that investors, especially in projects in developing countries, were inhibited by fears of non-commercial risks and lack of local knowledge and technical assistance. MIGA could assist these investors by issuing guarantees, including co-insurance and reinsurance against non-commercial risks in respect of investments in a member country which flow from other member countries. MIGA can offer protection against losses arising from non&hyphen;convertibility of currency but not devaluations and various other risks, such as losses of ownership or control over the investment, losses arising from an inability of the investor to enforce a court decision concerning an investment contract against the host country and losses arising from damage to tangible assets arising from disturbances, including revolution, terrorism and sabotage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its inception until 1996, MIGA has considered 215 projects. Forty developing countries have benefited from these projects and more than $US15 billion of direct foreign investment has been generated from investment guarantees issued by MIGA. This means jobs and opportunities for often the most disadvantaged peoples in the world. Eradicating poverty in the world, which I am sure is a shared goal of all members of this Senate, means facilitating economic development throughout the developing world. MIGA provides one piece of the international frame 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5903"> work to facilitate increased economic investment by assisting investors to have the confidence to invest in nations which are considered to have significant sovereign risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 128 developing countries of MIGA and 21 industrial country members or signatories to the convention, including all of the G7 nations. As well as assisting the laudable aims of MIGA, Australian membership should also assist Australian firms doing business&mdash;for example, through obtaining an MIGA guarantee or through obtaining political risk insurance. I say as an aside that this is one aspect that some critics of our international involvement often do not choose to highlight. In addition, Australian membership should be viewed positively by other nations in terms of fulfilling our international development obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total cost of the shares in MIGA are around $25 million, of which 10 per cent will be paid in cash in 1997&hyphen;98, a further 10 per cent by way of promissory note, with the balance being a contingent liability which is on call if required. The bill appropriates the necessary moneys under clause 4 and authorises the issue of securities under clause 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the benefits of joining MIGA were in excess of the costs and that therefore Australia should join. I reiterate the economic advantages of being a member of MIGA exceed the economic costs. That is obviously as well as the important contribution MIGA makes to assisting in the eradication of poverty in those 128 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask Senator Kemp at this stage if he could confirm for the Senate the financial implications of the legislation for future Australian governments. Specifically, is it correct that the maximum amount of additional contribution beyond the $2.5 million pledged in cash and the $2.5 million to be covered by promissory notes is actually around $20 million? I reiterate the Labor opposition's support for the passage of this legislation as swiftly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The development of the global economy means that Australia must direct its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> foreign affairs policy towards not only protecting our own interests but also working with other governments to ensure a cooperative approach to solving common problems. A few of those common problems include controlling international speculation, ending the exploitation of women and children, protecting the environment, raising workplace health and safety standards, solving the growing refugee problem, addressing the growing global levels of unemployment and income polarisation, reducing the concentration of economic and technical power and ending the use of the land mines. These problems can only be overcome by governments working together to set the national and international standards under which the new global game will be played.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a middle ranking power and there is obviously a limit to what it can do. Australia can, in fact should, take a stand on these important matters of great principle. This is the spirit in which I propose to move an amendment to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to appropriate funds and to issue securities to affect Australia's membership to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. The MIGA is an institution of the World Bank and it is designed to foster foreign investment in developing countries by providing insurance against risks and by providing advisory services regarding foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia signed the MIGA in September 1996. That was after the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that we join the MIGA because the benefits outweighed the costs. Those benefits which they nominated included the encouragement of economic growth, that membership would provide part of the rationale for our policy on overseas aid and, importantly, that it also provided for facilitated commercial opportunities for Australian business operating in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the foreign affairs white paper is tabled today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) it is likely to recommend that Australia focus its energies to expand our relationship in Asia. Presumably, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5904"> this will refer to a growing economic relationship. Considering the dreadful damage that the government has inflicted on our people-to-people relationships with Asia through the closing down of Radio Australia's Darwin transmitter, it really cannot be anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this growing economic focus, the Democrats believe that Australian business must take responsibility for ensuring that our investments and the employment practices of Australians working overseas recognise the rights of workers and the need to protect the environment. The federal government should make it clear to all Australian businesses operating overseas that it expects that they shall act at all times in a manner consistent with international human rights and in accordance with Australian domestic law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will not be news to my fellow members of the foreign affairs and human rights subcommittees of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade because it is something that I raise with them all the time. In fact, it is something for which I have, I am sure, a good deal of sympathy inside that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australian workers are protected by occupational health and safety rules and regulation in this country, then why should Australian businesses be allowed to drop those standards merely because they are operating offshore? Similarly, if Australian companies have to undertake an environmental impact statement before they undertake, for example, infrastructure development in this country, then why should those standards for environmental protection not be undertaken in overseas developing countries, especially those whose rules and laws are not consistent with our minimum standards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not only for the protection of the workers or for the protection of the environment of those developing countries within which Australian businesses seek to operate. These standards would also indicate that Australia is still a good global citizen, willing to comply with at least minimum standards for workers and environmental protection. That is something that we need to reinforce very much at the moment. So those are the reasons why I am moving my amendment to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the second reading motion of the bill today. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate is of the view that all Australian companies operating overseas should adhere to the minimum environmental and occupational health and safety standards that would apply to the company in Australia or to a company registered and operating in the relevant country".</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R95">Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill</XREF>  is designed to accept an international convention and join the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, a part of the World Bank institutions. The agency is intended to protect foreign investors&mdash;and that should be understood as private sector investors&mdash;by insuring them against various risks. The idea is that foreign investment is the same as development and that what is good for Union Carbide is good for Bhopal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Bank hardly has an unblemished record on human rights and environmental issues, even in its own programs. It has supported large infrastructure projects which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being forcibly relocated from small subsistence farms to urban shantytowns. It has supported numerous badly planned projects, such as dam projects that did not fulfil their objective of providing good physical infrastructure because they were poorly planned and silted up quickly. They did not fulfil their social objectives: they mostly provided power for exploitative industries at subsidised rates while not providing any substantial benefit to ordinary people, resulting in dislocation of large numbers of people and the flooding of communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dams were also frequently environmentally destructive, again due to poor planning, not only destroying waterways that were biotically important and affecting things like fisheries as far as the ocean but also being reservoirs of disease, creating conditions downstream which favoured parasites that live in the snails of slow moving waters. In relation to dam projects, schistosomiasis seems to be something of an environmental disease that continues to affect people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5905">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Bank's poor environmental and social record has resulted in various cosmetic and, later, serious efforts to make their loans and the projects that they supported less environmentally and socially malign. They even had Herman Daly, as well&hyphen;known theorist in the area of ecologically sustainable economics, on their staff to monitor their performance. He remained highly critical during his time at the bank. He decried their lack of action and resources for their environmental unit and their failure to apply the environmental standards they had developed as criteria for loans in their own activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they have made some improvements since Daly's time, but they are not huge. There has been substantial criticism of the World Bank for its support of the International Monetary Fund and the IMF&hyphen;like structural adjustment policies requiring the wind&hyphen;back of regulation governing foreign investment and imports, and requiring cutbacks in the delivery of availability of social programs like health, education and the provision of clean water. So it is with reservation and suspicion that I see that this agency will be administered by the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency is part of a push to protect the investments of global companies and to allow them to invest in ways that give little or nothing back to recipient nations. Most of the international measures in trade fora, such as the World Trade Organisation's consideration of trade&hyphen;related investment measures&mdash;TRIM&mdash;and APEC demands, particularly by the United States, try to force nations to eliminate any regulation of foreign investment through the use of the trade sanctions cudgel. Along these lines, we have seen the United States push for Australia to eliminate the Foreign Investment Review Board, in spite of the totally innocuous and ineffective nature of that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the so&hyphen;called developing world, the push for freedom of foreign investment takes the form of restrictions or prohibitions on any nation requiring a company extracting forest to actually do some of the downstream processing in the country. They prohibit any requirement for a percentage of profit to be reinvested within the nation where profit is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made. They prohibit any requirement by a so&hyphen;called sovereign nation to say that goods produced in a country must be made available at competitive prices within that country. They prohibit any restriction on the transfer of assets or profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we are told by the same World Trade Organisation that we cannot apply similar environmental or sustainable process standards on imports as we do on our own products because that would be infringing on the sovereignty of other nations. Though this is administered by the World Bank, the investments they wish to eliminate risks from&mdash;using donations from Australia and other developed countries, paid for by their citizens&mdash;are private sector investments made on a for&hyphen;profit basis. They are not development assistance. They are not in any way or form in order to benefit the people of the country in which the investments are being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see in the criteria for eligible investments, article 12, that investments can be new greenfield investments. They can be investments to modernise, expand or develop existing investment. They can therefore be used for something like CRC expanding an HCFC plant in China, even though China produces excellent, indigenously developed refrigerants that do not add to global warming. Under 12(c)(ii) guaranteed expenditure can be any use of profit within the country, presumably from the non-use of the term, whether or not that use is investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The things that the agency must satisfy themselves about, as included in 12(d), are minimal. An investment must be economically sound, that is, be likely to turn a profit. It must not be a criminal operation. That is reassuring given that their risks are being guaranteed by the taxpayers of the so-called developed world. It is nice to know the World Bank will not support drug cartels or sale of female sex slaves, at least where those are open purposes of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another criteria is that the host country already has a legal framework prohibiting most of the things this agency is supposed to prevent the risk of, that is, legal protection of the investment. A fourth criteria is that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5906"> investment be consistent with the declared development objectives and priorities of the host nation. Now that criteria has some potential to assure there is some benefit to people. It depends how it will be interpreted. Unfortunately, the World Bank has never been strong on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Bank does, however, have criteria and guidelines for social impact, social justice and equity, environmental protection and ecologically sustainable development. We hope that our government will argue that these be explicitly included in the criteria for giving a private sector investment a multi-governmental public sector guarantee against economic risk. We think that the World Bank, in all of its agencies and institutions, must be made much more responsible and its policies applied more consistently and transparently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second element we seek to see as a criteria is that investors should apply the standards of environmental protection, occupational health and safety and public health and safety at the level required in their home countries or standards which apply in the country whose standards are highest, where a company is equally at home in several countries. I do not think this is a lot to ask. These investors are being presented as worthy of international support on the basis that they are part of the international development effort. But today's international development effort takes account of the legitimate social goals of nations receiving assistance and stresses the need for measures that reduce absolute poverty, increase equity and specifically help the poorest people and communities. It takes account of the relationship between poverty and environmental degradation, and exploitative investment. It embraces the principles of ecological sustainability in some form or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore entirely inappropriate to support the sort of investment based on reduced costs because there are lower standards of protection. Part of the principles of development is the application and transfer of improved technology, particularly technology which makes a project safer; safer for workers, safer for the public around a plant and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safer for the environment on which the poor in a developing nation depend far more heavily than those in developed nations. The principle of profit maximisation through exploiting lower standards in a poor country runs diametrically opposite to these principles of development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, I would like to point out that one of the stated objectives of this agency is&mdash;from page 20, line 8&mdash;to seek to remove impediments, in both developed and developing member countries, to the flow of investment to developing member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have Bhopal as one of the major testaments of profitoriented investment. This agency, with its guarantees, would, on my understanding, insulate Union Carbide from India's attempts to wrest some compensation from them. If India sought to freeze accounts or hold profits and assets in the country, that is precisely the sort of risk this agency would protect a corporate investor from and it would use Australian money, and the money of other developed nations, supposedly provided for development purposes, in order to do this. This is not a fanciful scenario; these things are happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agency would protect investors against risk&mdash;including companies like BHP, RTZ/CRA, Western Mining or Century Zinc&mdash;in investments like Ok Tedi, Bougainville or Mindanao. Any attempt by nations involved to prevent the repatriation of profits, even to assure that they do not just flee pending a court action, would seem to be covered here under article 11(a)(i) which guarantees against loss resulting from:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any introduction attributable to the host Government of restriction on the transfer outside the host country of its currency into a freely useable currency or another currency acceptable to the holder of the guarantee, including a failure of the host government to act within a reasonable period of time on an application by such holder for such a transfer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, this first measure is insurance against a company having its financial assets frozen. The second is a guarantee against having any material assets or activities frozen in any way. Work at Ok Tedi could not be ordered to stop for an investigation, since it would: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5907">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . deprive the holder of a guarantee of his ownership and control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, the fourth measure would insure Bougainville Copper against their economic loss from the civil disturbance there, in spite of the fact that they are heavily implicated in the disturbance and the conflict started in 1988 as protest against environmental degradation and social loss from the mining venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the rhetoric is about arbitrary moves by dictatorial leaders of banana republics, but this is more about making sure big transnationals do not ever lose a cent. What is not recognised is the inequality of power in relationships between global companies and the poor. I know that, in many cases, it is the governments of those companies which are very much involved in those decisions. That does not make it any better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For years now, we have had reports from South America and other countries of poor people, often displaced from their land, living in tin shacks amidst industrial effluent and heavily polluted land, seeing their children born with outrageous levels of birth defects, and people of all ages suffering from industrial diseases and cancers. Even when these people know they have a high chance of having children born without limbs or with various disorders, often both serious or irremediable, they move in because, when development of a dam, ranch, mine or forestry operation eliminates their farm and the farms of all their neighbours, there is nowhere else to go. These industrially blighted areas hold the potential of a job which may mean the capacity to survive, although the very low wages do not give a capacity to do much more than survive in the shantytowns. This picture is, after all, what developing world poverty is about. It is these kinds of situations that have created the passions of Susan George or Jacabo Schatan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The developing world can easily be the Navaho&hyphen;Hopi reservation in the US south-west, where the wonderful offer of jobs and opportunities in the uranium mines around Redrock resulted in the premature death of virtually all the adult men in the town. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> United States government then tried to cover the embarrassment by demanding that the widows move away to Flagstaff or some other major town before they got a pension. The Widows of Redrock campaign was born&mdash;the Navaho women's fight to stay on their own land, among their own people. That campaign was about the right not to be moved away, but the underlying theme was the utter contempt with which these people were treated, due to the ability to overlook a number of occupational safety and public health laws since it was on an Indian reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big free trade push of the last decade put a new wrinkle in this situation. We have seen situations in North America where the opening of the border between the United States and Mexico and the institution&mdash;though perhaps imposition would be more accurate&mdash;of a free investment regime has meant that a very large number of industrial enterprises moved from the United States to Mexico. They did not move deep into established Mexican population areas, but just across the border, so the managers could continue living in Texas, Arizona or California. The goods produced could be immediately sent to their intended market, which was the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial estates&mdash;in which the United States environmental laws did not apply, where waste was simply dumped into the surrounding countryside and rivers&mdash;became known as the Maquiladoras. I remember vividly an article about a relocated Zenith plant which makes colour TV picture tubes. It had moved from the United States. The author of the article talked with US workers who had lost their jobs and who had seen not only their own plant shut down and disappear but also many of the other industries in town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article also interviewed Mexican workers who lived in shanties near the factory, very near to waste tips. The workers talked about industrial diseases and the effects of being exposed to the chemicals that line picture tubes. They were not that ignorant, just poor and powerless. They knew that a job in a Maquiladora was one of the few opportunities they had to feed their families, and they were not going to imperil that by com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5908"> plaining too loudly about wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not long after that article, a year or so, there were news reports from southern Texas of whole towns where suddenly a very high percentage of babies began to be born with serious congenital birth defects. By serious, I mean born with part of their brain and spinal nerve chord exposed. Nearly all of the problems were nervous system skeletal development problems, and the cause was found to be pollution in the rivers from the waste of Maquiladoras across the border in Mexico.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are these the kinds of investments we are seeking to protect? Both the United States and Mexico used the rhetoric of development for pushing to create this sort of situation. I know that a clause in the covenant about being consistent with the development goals of a host country system is not going to prevent such investment. So we have here a program to use Australian taxpayers' money in the name of development to guarantee corporate investors against risks and loss in such operations. Do people really wonder why I do not consider this kind of bill non-controversial?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occasionally, people speaking for their party&mdash;these are parties which blindly support the free trade agenda&mdash;accuse me of not wanting poorer nations to develop. I think it is fine for them to develop. I do not consider it development when poverty forces poor people to live in working conditions which imperil the life and health of workers, their families and children in order to bolster corporate profits and make one gang of corporate capitalists slightly more competitive so that they can try to take over the market from their mates and win the market share or profitability game. That is what it is&mdash;it is a game for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not consider it development when this destructive exploitation of the poor and developing countries is used as a club to destroy living and working standards in so-called developed countries, including our country, or to prohibit any discrimination which recognises the cost imposed by allowing exploitation of people and nature to create competitive advantage.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just do not buy the explanation that the developing nations are underpolluted and poor families in India, Brazil or Mexico who live near these industrial towns need to have one child in four born with serious pollution-caused congenital diseases. I do not accept that situation made as a result of imperilled survival. Inequalities of power established by social relations of poverty equate to free choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus of both the Democrats' second reading amendment and my substantive amendments are simply to require that, if it is set up in the name of development, it should not be supporting the kind of situation where unsafe practices are used to disastrously exploit poor developing nation workers which, in turn, is used as an argument to reduce wages and conditions for battling workers in the north. My amendment goes a bit further and asks that the environmental standards be applied to avoid situations such as the Ok Tedi and Bougainville disputes.

I am able to say that, as I think was outlined fairly clearly in the second reading speech, Australia will be providing $2.45 million in cash, a further $2.45 million as a promissory note, and the remainder of Australian dollars&mdash;$19.6 million&mdash;on call. Of course, these Australian dollar amounts may fluctuate with changes in the Australian&hyphen;US dollar exchange rate. These US dollar amounts are the maximum authorised by the bill, which reflects the convention establishing the MIGA. In conclusion, I commend this important bill to the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give notice now that, unless my amendment is passed, I will oppose the bill.

I do not believe in undermining the sovereign right of nations to effectively decide on regulation and management of foreign investment when we claim that we can do nothing for the environ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment or workers of poor ex&hyphen;colony nations because it violates their sovereign rights. Does sovereignty apply only when it is for maintaining high levels of exploitation and never when it comes to social and environmental protection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that this measure creates a guarantee only for non&hyphen;commercial risks. My problem is that these are defined to cover virtually any regulatory action a nation might take to make a foreign investment more beneficial to it and any remedial measure it might take in the case of something like the Bhopal disaster. This is irresponsible, particularly as it totally ignores the need to address the fact that, in the global market, competitive advantages are created by the lack of consistent measures to ensure economic activities are ecologically sustainable and beneficial for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly irresponsible because it dovetails efforts through the World Trade Organisation to undermine any unilateral action by nations to ensure that their imports, competing with products for which appropriate environmental standards are developed, are not advanced in market terms simply because they are produced or extracted unsustainably. We are not allowed to discriminate against unsustainably harvested tropical timber. This is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures are also particularly irresponsible because they dovetail with efforts through the World Trade Organisation to undermine any unilateral action by nations to ensure that their domestic products are not subject to unfair competition based on the exploitation of child labour, bonded labour or prison labour such as that of the notorious Chinese laogai camps. Political and social prisoners are forced to work for many years making hardware and other products, including diamond brand products, that flood our hardware stores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been prevented from dealing unilaterally on these issues, which are basic issues of global responsibility and human rights. Now we are preventing nations from effectively attempting to regulate foreign investment. Make no mistake: a nation may still be allowed to do something like freeze 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5911"> assets, but this will be fairly ineffective if the assets are guaranteed by an international agency like MIGA. This is a corporate agency, not a development agency. It has nothing whatsoever to do with decreasing poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international labour standards issue is a large one. The agenda of the major international agencies&mdash;the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank&mdash;are all in opposition to it. My amendment would say that, before even thinking of supporting this covenant, Australia should at the very least ensure that it is in accord with the very basic guidelines and criteria of the World Bank designed to ensure that development is not destructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Australia supports this covenant, we should ensure that the covenant requires corporations to use good environmental management technology and practices and should use decent public and occupational health and safety measures, as it does in developed countries. This would apply equally to all corporations wanting a MIGA guarantee to all competitors seeking that protection for investment. Of course it is not giving anybody an unfair advantage unless they wish to operate outside that. It is a measure designed to ensure that free investment in a global economy, if it is to be considered development, must raise the level of protection within developing countries, not translating to an excuse for corporations to lower their technical standards of safety and protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see this covenant as part of the push for more free ranging corporate power at the expense of civil and political power. I see it as part of the battle between a vision of competitive economic warfare with the winners writing the rules and a vision of human and humane development which includes providing for ecological survival. The intention of this covenant is right in line with the World Trade Organisation, IMF and World Bank push for dominance of global capitalists. My amendment seeks to subvert this covenant and make it part of the struggle represented by the United Nations, UNCTAD, and UNCED push to ensure that all people on earth can live sustainably in peace and with material sufficiency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when the debate was interrupted I was pointing out that the National Party is very much in favour of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R192">Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997</XREF> , although it is well known that the National Party opposes voluntary voting and the majority of the party and the party's position is for the continuation of the constitution as it stands at the moment. I put those two issues very firmly on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government went to an election with a very clear proposal that we have a convention and that the convention be made up of a number of elected delegates&mdash;a number of women, a number of Aboriginals, a number of young people; a good mix representing all sections of the Australian community. I think the government has been very honest. It is no secret where the Prime Minister's position is on the constitution. He has continued to progress this bill, although he could have very easily said, `All bets are off. We have put it up twice; it has been rejected twice so just let it disappear into the ether.' But he has not. He has met his commitments, not once, not twice but now three times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party seems to be holding out. I cannot quite understand this. I usually can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> follow the logic of the Labor Party, but it seems to be holding out on some spurious objection that this is a sort of stalking horse for non-compulsory voting for the rest of Australia. There is a very big difference in voting for a government&mdash;voting for 148 members of parliament, voting for 76 senators&mdash;that is going to stay in office for three years and govern the nation. If that were the proposal I would not be supporting non-compulsory voting, but that is not the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal is that we elect 36 delegates to the convention and that the convention sit for approximately 10 days at some time in the future. There is a huge difference between compulsory and non-compulsory voting for a convention and for the election of a government. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting this bill. I am on the record as a very strong supporter of compulsory voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the election and we came up with a convention that would give fair proportional representation to all Australians. The opposition's obstruction to this is very hard to understand. I believe they are denying the people a say in the progress of the Constitutional Convention. They are denying the opportunity for democracy to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest proposal of the Australian Democrats is to have a Senate committee go out and take evidence right around Australia. I thought that was an absolutely stupid idea, and I thought it was one that only the Democrats would come up with. But not to be outdone by stupidity, the Labor Party proposed exactly the same thing this morning. It just shows that you really do need the big man on the frontbench. I do not think he would allow you to get into so much trouble. Senator Robert Ray is a good tactician. If he was on the frontbench, I would find it very difficult to see how this would ever happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the proposal of the Senate inquiry is to work, where is the appropriation going to come from to go to a referendum, or to put the yes or no case, or to have the election? It is just a nonsense. It is just a grandstanding nonsense that will absolutely drive this debate nowhere. The objection of the Labor Party to non-compulsory voting or voluntary voting is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5917"> very hard to understand when they elect their own delegates on non-compulsory voting or voluntary voting. ATSIC delegates are elected by voluntary voting. Senator Nick Minchin nominated a few other points, particularly that Senator Kernot gets elected to her leadership of the Australian Democrats by a voluntary vote of all members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, it is very difficult to understand where the Labor Party and the Democrats are coming from on this issue. It is a denial of what was put forward in the policy of the then opposition that we would have this convention when we gained government. It is a convention that will appoint 40 parliamentary delegates made up of 20 state and territory delegates and 20 federal parliamentary delegates, and 36 non-parliamentary delegates including groups such as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and representatives from local governments, and at least 10 will be between the age of 18 and 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is a pretty broad church that will be able to get in there and debate this issue if this bill goes through. It will be able to come up with whether or not Australia should become a republic, which republic model should be put to the electorate to consider against the status quo, and the time frame and the circumstances under which change may be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is very commendable. It should go to a convention where a whole number of issues can be debated by people that are able to put some research in. That will no doubt be reported on by all the major newspapers and television stations. That message will go out. No doubt there will be a case put for the constitution to remain the same. There will also be a case put for the republic to take place, but at least it will be an informed debate by all sectors of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal that the Democrats and the Labor Party are putting up today will be just a Senate inquiry going around Australia. It will have no support from the government at all. It will be run by the opposition. If this is to be successful, one way or the other, it has to have the government behind it. It is a complete and utter nonsense to go out there with a Senate inquiry. You are absolutely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> devaluing the currency of Senate inquiries with this sort of situation. I support the bill on behalf of the National Party. I hope Senator Harradine can bring some sense into the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been agonising over the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R192">Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997</XREF>  with colleagues in the Greens party both in Tasmania and the mainland for the last week. We have twice put to the government proposals which would have allowed the convention to proceed with very minor concessions by the government. I spoke with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) two days ago about this and he was adamant that they would brook no conditions whatever. The strong impression I gained in those talks I had with him and his colleagues, despite their denials, is that they do not want this legislation to pass and that they do not want the republic to progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my talks with the Greens around the country, there have been great misgivings about whether I should vote to ensure that the convention does proceed. I thank everybody who has expressed those misgivings but who have ultimately given me the support to make a decision based on a consensus coming from the Greens around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in the Senate at the moment the ranks of those opposed to the republic supporting this legislation and the ranks of those supporting the republic opposing this legislation. They are the ranks of absurdity. Somebody needed to break from those ranks, and I have decided to do so. I have decided to do so in the interests of this nation because Australians want a republic. They want to be involved in the path to the republic. They want a republic as we move into the new century. They want a republic for this nation. They want a republic for the Olympics. To pass this opportunity is to kill those aspirations of the Australian people. I will take it on my shoulders when the critics come out, but I firmly believe that, in the interests of Australians, it was necessary for me to change and to support this legislation, and I will be doing so by supporting this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so, I want to say this: the one thing that the debate and the intransigence on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5918"> both sides of this Senate indicates is that we need to give the republic back to the people. For all its shortcomings&mdash;and they are considerable&mdash;this convention is a means of doing that. I hope that the assent to the convention will mobilise all Australians for or against the republic so that they come forward in good faith for this country, express their opinions and become involved in this debate, not simply leave it to the delegates but ensure that their voices are heard as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great stumbling blocks put in the way of assent to this legislation has been the formulation post&hyphen;election by the government of a postal vote system. I spoke strongly against this matter in the Senate when it was considered before. I have not changed my mind about the fact that there ought to be a full and compulsory vote. We had the situation of two competing principles, both held strongly by the Australian Greens. One was that we should be moving expeditiously to a full and rounded republic. The other was that we should protect the system of compulsory voting, which is so important to Australian elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that this convention is an advisory body with essentially no powers, except those galvanised through the Australian people and through the republic. We have to remember the impulse, the power of that voice, on government to act and the promise of the government that there would be plebiscites or a referendum if there is consensus before the year 2000. It is not a parliament that is being elected. They are not people who can make definitive decisions. It is a once&hyphen;off constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, and knowing that there is no way that this government, or any government in the foreseeable future, has a hope of changing the compulsory voting system while this Senate has the configuration that it does, including the National Party, and opposes such a voting system, it became clear that the republic should not stumble on that impediment placed there by this unwilling Howard government. I am going to support this principle, this once&hyphen;only opportunity in this period of conservative governments, to progress the republic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel strongly that we will not see a change to the voluntary voting system. I note that I am not the only one who has changed position on this. The Labor Party has as well. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), as late as March, when this legislation was coming before the parliament, said that he would not block this legislation&mdash;shortcomings as it had. Labor is now blocking it, and we Australian Greens are opening a way for it to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember also that half the delegates for this convention are to be appointed&mdash;no vote at all, not even a free vote. Maybe there has been too little emphasis on the shortcomings of that. I believe that all the delegates to this convention ought to be voted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the republic, we Greens are concerned that the major parties have their focus too narrow. We want to see this opportunity seized to make changes beyond the head of state for Australia as it moves into the next century. Why should we not take this opportunity to recognise and celebrate the indigenous nation of Australian peoples at the head of the constitution? Why should we not take this opportunity to recognise local government in our constitution? Why should we not make this the opportunity to take into the constitution a bill of rights and responsibilities for all Australians, for this nation of ours, forevermore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we not recognise the responsibility of the nation and its national parliament and government for the environment of this country and put it into the constitution? It deserves to be there. These are just some of the matters which ought to be on the agenda of the constitutional convention and, as an outcome of that, put to the people of Australia in the plebiscite or referendum that follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, why should we not take up the finding of this parliamentary committee that section 44 of the constitution should be altered to ensure that all Australians have a fair opportunity to stand for parliament? I think most Australians do not recognise that more than a million citizens are denied that opportunity because section 44 puts a question mark over people being able to stand for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5919"> parliament if they have dual nationality or if they are recipients of an office of profit, including, potentially, even pensions. That is blocking their way to being able to stand for office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These considerations have loomed hard and high in my consideration. I feel strongly about this. I feel it is the right decision. I feel it moves the roadblock. I again thank my colleagues in the Australian Greens for coming with me down this difficult path to this right outcome for this nation and for 18 million Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating whether we should insist upon our amendments to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. The motion that is currently before the chamber is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee does not insist upon its amendments which the House of Representatives has insisted on disagreeing to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would first of all like to acknowledge the very fine speeches that have been made not only over the last couple of days in the Senate and the House of Representatives but also on the previous occasion that this matter came before us. A considerable amount of thought has gone into all of those speeches. They are interesting reading and have assisted me considerably. I believe everybody is interested in who should be the head of state in Australia. The constitutional convention that is proposed by the government is to consider that matter. The speech by Senator Minchin yesterday was a very strong speech indicating the strength of view of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Minchin and the cabinet about this particular question and about the right of the people to consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night Senator Margetts also made a deeply considered speech. That set me thinking a little bit about what matters would be considered by a constitutional convention if such a constitutional convention or if a parliamentary committee were to go around the place and consider other views. Senator Margetts was saying that there are other matters to be considered which are not included in the agenda in this bill. The agenda of the constitutional convention as set out in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bill would provide a forum for discussion on whether the present constitution should be changed to a republican one; in particular, which republican model should be put to the electorate to consider against the status quo; and, in what time frame and under what circumstances might any change be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of you who have studied my speeches on the convention&mdash;I suppose none of you have done that, and that indicates your sense&mdash;would find that over the years I have been concerned to ensure the preservation of parliamentary democracy as we know it. There should not be further moves&mdash;as was proposed by a frontbencher of the Labor Party at the time&mdash;to introduce into the constitution by referendum, for example, a bill of rights or measures that would take away from this parliament the duties to be performed on behalf of those who elect us. For example, that would be a broadly based bill of rights which would be able to be interpreted by judges. This country would then have a system of judge made laws, as there is to a certain extent in the United States at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the things that concern me. The issue as is put forward on the agenda&mdash;it is a limited agenda; I think the people of Australia believe the agenda should be considered before the year 2000 or around about the year 2000&mdash;is, namely, who should be the head of state. That is a very important question. How do we progress this matter? Certain proposals have been suggested. Ultimately, the parliament is the organisation which will have to determine the question that goes to the people. It is the parliament's prerogative&mdash;and, indeed, duty&mdash;to do that. If there is a constitutional convention, the parliament will no doubt be assisted by what occurs at the constitutional convention and in the lead&hyphen;up to the constitutional convention. If not, a suggestion has been made by both the opposition and the Australian Democrats that a committee of the parliament should be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that at some stage that will need to take place. At some stage, members of the parliament from all parties, and others in the parliament, should with goodwill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5920"> consider what provisions ought to be included in a referendum bill. That will have to be done at some stage. It has been put to me, and people have said so in their speeches, that if there is no constitutional convention the puff will go out of the debate on the republic or who should be the head of state. Of course, that is a matter which needs to be considered. I am still concerned about the major questions that have been raised; that is, the precedent that might occur as a result of the voting provisions in this particular bill. That is a very important problem, a very important matter, that has been addressed by everyone in this chamber. It does concern me&mdash;I have previously expressed my view on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that does concern me somewhat is the nature of the proposed composition of the convention. Frankly, as we all know, in previous days when there was a constitutional convention there was equality of representation from the states. Clearly, the government has got equality of representation when it comes to politicians, but it does not have that equality of representation when it comes to those who will be elected and those who will be appointed. That does worry me a little bit because this is a specific convention for a specific purpose, but it is not a matter which weighs heavily on my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that under section 128 of the constitution the Senate has the power to vote for a referendum bill and have that bill referred to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives rejects that legislation, it is put to them again after three months. If the House of Representatives rejects it again, under the current provisions of the constitution the Governor&hyphen;General may put the matter to the people for determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be a constitutional argument as to whether the Governor&hyphen;General could do that without the support of the government. In any event, you do need the support of the government, at least for questions to go to the people. Unless you get that support there will be a negative vote by the people. Look at the history of constitutional referenda in this country. I would not like to be betting on the outcome of constitutional referenda, having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regard to the form for the outcome in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having regard to all those matters and the need to continue to have public debate about the matter, I am inclined to support the proposition that is currently before us: that we not insist upon the amendments. However, the matter that concerns most people about this is the voting provision under this act. It is of great concern not only to me but also to a broad number of people&mdash;probably the majority of the people in the parliament. I expect that that is so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under those circumstances, I had discussions with a number of people about this. I am proposing an amendment to the current motion before us&mdash;the amendment would be at the end of the motion. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate is of the view that having regard to the fact that the system of voluntary voting provided for in the bill is for the election of delegates to a specific Constitutional Convention for a limited and temporary purpose in special circumstances, the system should not be seen as a precedent for elections of members of parliament or for any other ballots including referendums".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the proposition that I am putting to the Senate. I will at a later stage be moving an amendment in the committee of the whole to amend the bill by inserting a declaratory statement that it is not the intention of the parliament that the method of voting for election under this act should be taken as a precedent. I do hope that that will receive the unanimous support of the parliament. It is, of course, for the government to say, but I understand that the government would support the amendment to the motion currently before us and the amendment to the legislation itself.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have always maintained, and I think people have always had a view of Senate predictability, that trying to work the numbers in the Senate is a bit like dancing with wolves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to acknowledge that Senator Harradine did, in fact, contact me and warn me about what he was thinking, as he has all the way through, I must say, and I am appreciative of that. We will vote for the Harradine amendments. Obviously, we think that it would be a bit naive to expect that they may carry some weight in terms of an ongoing crusade by some to have voluntary voting imported into our system, but I do thank Senator Harradine for the advance notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take an opportunity to congratulate Malcolm Turnbull for a successful turnabout. We have worked very closely with him over recent months; we have obviously disagreed over latter days, but the resilience of the Republican Movement is such that we are mature enough to continue to work with each other in order to maximise the vote for the republican cause into the future. Senator Brown also has been discussing this with me. From time to time we lost contact, but I am sure he will also be in the cart in terms of the quest for a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We obviously have some firm views about the inadequacies of the government's proposals for the procedures of the convention. We do not think it is the best way to progress the republican issue but, more importantly, we think it is flawed in many ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now faced with the reality of an election for this convention. In this context, the leader, myself and, in fact, every spokesperson for the opposition, has made it clear that, though we have always thought that this process was flawed, we have said that if it proceeds we would participate in the process as part of the Australian Republican Movement. We would not run our own tickets but we would join with others who are like&hyphen;minded in wanting Australia to become a republic, as well as encouraging involvement from other groups. Under the broad umbrella of the ARM, with Democrats, with members of the Liberal Party, with Independents, with Greens and so on, we would work to maximise the outcome. That, of course, will still be our position with the passing of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that disappointment, we will be in the cart to maximise the return for the Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tralian Republican Movement and to ensure that some constructive thinking and constructive agendas are set so that there is a continuation of pressure on government and so that we move towards a republic referendum before the year 2000, and to realise the aspirations of so many millions of Australian people. We will do it with the labour movement, we will do it with the Republican Movement and we will work with other organisations. It has always been our view that the plebiscite was the most appropriate way to go. With the authority of the Australian people expressed in a plebiscite, that sort of impetus would ensure that the republican road was more certain than the one proposed by the government. But we do know why the government is proposing this one; it is because they do not share the conviction that Australia should be a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will participate under the ARM umbrella and within the ARM umbrella with other organisations. But the focus now is also going to be on the government to make this work&mdash;to make it work fairly and to make it work in a way that reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Australians who have made up their minds on whether Australia should become a republic. We will ensure there is scrutiny so that the appointed members reflect fully the expressions of the Australian public. We will scrutinise to ensure that all Australians have a fair and equal say and that the process is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that the process is fair, I think that the ultimate test on what the government is doing is twofold: they will have to reach that benchmark of ensuring participation of all the Australian people at all stages of the process. We do not think that they can realise that, but that is the benchmark that has been set for them by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and that is the benchmark that we believe should be the appropriate one and we will ensure that they are tested against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second benchmark against which they will be tested is the fairness of the process. I think the ultimate test there is that the process should and must deliver an outcome which does reflect the overwhelming support by Australians for Australia to become an inde 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5922"> pendent republic by or around the year 2000. They are the two tests that you have set for yourself, Senator Minchin, and they are the two tests that we have set for you as well, and we will ensure scrutiny through the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This convention will now be held next year. There is likely to be an election next year as well. I think it is important that this election be held in the lead&hyphen;up to a general election. The closer the better, as far as the opposition is concerned, because for us it will focus people's attention on a clear distinction between the unity on our side of politics for a republic and the disharmony, disunity and disagreement on the government side in terms of a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the pre-election 12-month period pressure will be on the government to ensure that the process is fair and it does not fall apart and that those millions of people who have moved addresses will be contacted and will be able to understand the new system of voting that the government is proposing. The burden is now on the government. We are very disappointed with the outcome. We have been thinking very hard about how to proceed in the event that this legislation got through.

We have pleaded with the ALP and the Democrats to see it in those terms and to examine electoral systems based on the particular circumstances. This is an election of delegates to attend a convention to discuss the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic. We are not electing a parliament; we are not electing a government. In those circumstances, as is the case with so many other organisations in Australia, the most appropriate method is a voluntary postal ballot. We have done that purely on its merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that has been advanced in this chamber repeatedly that this is somehow some kind of Trojan Horse has always been nonsense. Only this parliament can change the Commonwealth Electoral Act to the previous position that elections be voluntary. The Commonwealth government has no proposition for the parliament to do that. If that question ever arises it should be dealt with on its merits and it would be a decision for this parliament alone. We have always asked the chamber to consider the question of the voting system for the election of delegates entirely on its merits and therefore we have no difficulty in accepting Senator Harradine's amendment to this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my gratitude to Senator Harradine and Senator Brown for their decision to now support this motion and presumably the bill. That means that the government and the Australian people can now proceed to have an election of delegates and to have a convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite true, as many in this chamber have said, that the coalition is not committed to Australia becoming a republic. We went to the Australian people saying that we thought the current constitutional arrangements had served Australia extremely well and that the case for change had not be made out. That was a clear statement of our position. So to attack us for saying that we are not committed to a republic is a nonsense because we made our position quite clear and we got elected on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that position, we put down a process which we believed would recognise the fact that there are a many Australians who have a contrary view and who want to consider this question. We thought about it long and hard and believe that the process we put up is the best way to involve the Australian people and to resolve the question of whether or not to become a republic and, if so, what sort of republic. The election process we have in mind does give all Australians the opportunity to be involved, but on the principle that they will have the right to choose whether or not to vote for delegates to the convention. That is their fundamental democratic right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the convention will be a terrific national forum. It will be in Canberra, the nation's capital. Australians from all over the country and from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and interests can come together to discuss these fundamental questions in, I hope and the government hopes, a very constructive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be asking the convention to discuss the up-front question of whether or not Australia should become a republic and then, if so, what is the best republican model for Australia. I hope that supporters of the current arrangements, as I am, will constructively engage in that debate and discuss the question of which model is the best for Australia if we are to make the move and also to have the convention discuss the best timing and circumstances under which such a change should be made if it is to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are quite sincere and positive in our wanting this convention to be a success in that sense. We would not be going through this process of a major national election and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a convention if we were not sincere in wanting something constructive to come out of it. My great regret is that we could not achieve this position at the end of June. If we had, we would now be completing the election process and moving towards a convention in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obstruction we have faced in the Senate on this question has meant a six&hyphen;month delay in the process and, of course, it has meant that the whole issue was killed stone&hyphen;dead by the hands of those who support a republic. As Jeff Kennett quite rightly said during the recess, this whole debate has been killed by the republicans themselves. That is, of course, what panicked Mr Turnbull and the Republican Movement into requesting the Senate to change its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue completely disappeared because the republicans in this chamber voted to kill it off completely. So I think it has backfired badly on those who have advocated a change to a republic. I think the wiser ones have seen the light and realise that, if we are to progress this debate, we should get on with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly disappointed by the position that the Labor Party and the Democrats have continued to take. They are going to vote against this for the third time. For parties that have actively campaigned for Australia to become a republic, it does seem extraordinary that they would keep on insisting that the process not proceed except according to their rules&mdash;an absolute objection to the procedures laid down by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can legitimately say that you think that the election should be conducted under other rules and argue that case. But, at the end of the day, I would have thought that the government of the nation, having listened to your arguments and rejected them, has the right to proceed to hold the convention based on the rules which it proposes. I accept that in principle you are committed to compulsory voting&mdash;a principle that I think is wrong&mdash;but to allow your obsession with forcing people to vote, to deny advancing the process of discussing the question of the republic, seems very much the action of an ostrich sticking its head in the sand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5924">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that Malcolm Turnbull has realised how ridiculous that position is and has pleaded with you all to change your position. We are grateful that at least Senator Harradine and Senator Brown have acted in a responsible manner in wanting to allow the process to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments against allowing this legislation through simply have not been persuasive. It is one thing to come in and state a position of principle&mdash;that you do not like voluntary voting&mdash;but to actually vote in a manner to deny the government of the day the opportunity to implement its policy on this matter does seem to us to be the kind of obstruction that Senator Kernot referred to in her speech yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole debate seems to have been conducted on the basis that we are talking about changing the method of election of parliamentarians&mdash;that has never been the case. Why you cannot agree&mdash;in the way that the parliament did in relation to the ATSIC elections with voluntary voting&mdash;that voluntary postal voting is the most appropriate method for delegates to a convention, who are there for only 10 days, completely escapes me, particularly given that any change to the constitution will involve a compulsory attendance ballot of all the Australian people. That is the only way the constitution can be changed, and there is no proposition to change that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party and the Democrats have been very pig&hyphen;headed on this and have reflected their unfortunate attitude of not wanting to cooperate at all and of trying to deny the government the opportunity of trying to implement a policy on which it was elected. In the event, I think they have locked themselves out of this debate. Despite their objections and obstructions, I am grateful that we are able to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the ALP, has said that they will involve themselves in the debate. I trust the Democrats will do the same. This national election deserves to have the support of all parties. We should all be out there encouraging all Australians to exercise their right to vote&mdash;I will be doing that, and I look to you to do the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same&mdash;encouraging candidates to nominate and to run for an election and ensuring that we have good constructive participation by all Australians in this quite exciting process. I think it is exciting. I think the election of delegates and the convention itself will allow that national forum to convene to discuss these important questions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They essentially relate to three areas. In recognition of the recommendations of the Senate committee that procedures for overseas voting should more properly reflect current arrangements in relation to federal elections, there are amendments to that effect, so that overseas voting will be facilitated in the way it is in federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 3 was an amendment put to the Senate committee by Malcolm Mackerras in relation to the number of below&hyphen;the&hyphen;line preference boxes for territories and smaller states. Again, that had bipartisan support and it is one that is acceptable to the government. Amendment No. 4 arose in the Adelaide hearings of the committee and was supported by Senator Bolkus. It is an amendment which the government is quite comfortable with in relation to the format of grouping candidate names.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 5 to 15 are the detailed amendments recommended by the committee in a bipartisan fashion in relation to overseas voting and which also the government is happy to accept.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be that others would be able to give you legal advice that referendum appearing here, as it does, could cover indicative plebiscites&mdash;a quite separate procedure. I guess that will have to lie in the eye of the beholder. The only  indicative plebiscite that I think we have had in our recent history was the national song plebiscite, which was conducted at the time of the 1977 election. While that was voluntary, it was conducted together with a federal election, which was of course compulsory, and therefore everybody voted. I would imagine that it would be the case by and large that most governments, in wanting to conduct plebiscites on any particular issue as an indicative process&mdash;maybe not on the republic but on most issues&mdash;would want to ensure a cost-effective testing of public opinion in that way by doing it together with a federal election, which is of course compulsory. So the question becomes somewhat academic. I do  not think I can add much more to that answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand what Senator Sherry is saying. I do believe at some stage there needs to be a shot across the bow of the World Bank by the parliament. I know this has been of concern to Senator Margetts. On the face of it, the motion that is currently before us does include, I believe, policies which are attractive. The statement was made by Senator Margetts that the World Bank hardly has an unblemished record on human rights and environmental issues even in its own program. That is a statement of fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts also stated that there has been substantial criticism of the World Bank through its support of IMF. IMF likes structural adjustment policies requiring the windback of regulation governing foreign investment and imports and requiring cut 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5930"> backs in the delivery or availability of social programs like health and education, even the provision of clean water. That is why she indicated that she had reservations and suspicions about this Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency by the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that we in Australia, particularly Treasury officials, need to have a good look at what is happening in the World Bank. They say that, yes, they do have a look at what is happening. Taking clean water as an example, I had the opportunity to take up this matter of clean water, which is so vital in many developing countries to the health and well-being of those countries, in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs on 21 August. I was asking AIDAB about what it was doing on the clean water front. Of course that is a matter I have been asking about before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked them specifically about PNG. I had previously asked them questions about the PNG, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and AusAID population and family planning project in Papua New Guinea. I raise this for the Minister representing the Treasurer because I think the Treasurer and the Treasury officials should have a good look at some of these programs and see what is in fact being done, whether or not we are adopting a paternalistic, almost a dictatorial, policy in areas in which we are funding World Bank activity.</PARA>

Are we there to generate a greater demand? `These poor ignorant PNG citizens; they don't know what's good for them; there are too many of them anyhow, so we'll pursue a greater demand.' What does Treasury think about that? What does the Treasurer think about it? There are innumerable areas and I could go on, but I will not. As a policy

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R232">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , which is before us, allows Australia to participate in the IMF's new arrangements to borrow, commonly known as NAB agreements. Australia played a key role in the development of the NAB following the Mexican financial crisis of late 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world characterised by massive flows of international capital, the IMF needs the capacity to draw on considerable resources in order to intervene effectively to deal with financial emergencies when they arise. The Mexican crisis highlighted the IMF's inadequate supplementary financing facility to deal at short notice with a major international financial emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now, the IMF's principal source of supplementary funds for intervening to stabilise financial emergencies has been through the general arrangements to borrow, known as the GAB. The members of the general arrangements to borrow are the G10 group of major industrialised countries&mdash;that is, the G7 plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. That adds up to 11 by my count. I do recall asking about this. Maybe the parliamentary secretary can tell us why it is 11 and not 10. The GAB provides special short&hyphen;term loans to the IMF members facing a currency crisis. The present GAB quota is approximately $US26 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the Mexican currency crisis of late 1994, the Australian government played 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a leading role in supporting moves to expand the GAB and its membership. At the IMF's annual meeting in October 1995, former Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis expressed Australia's support for a doubling of the GAB and stated that Australia would be prepared to participate in a wider scheme provided that, firstly, all participants had the same rights and responsibilities; secondly, contributions were based on the relative economic standing of the participants; thirdly, all members were able to participate fully in activation arrangements; and, fourthly, voting rights were determined by the shares of commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event, some of the smaller members of the G10 resisted attempts to expand the membership of the GAB as they wanted to protect the privileges they enjoy as members of the G10. In effect, expanding the GAB would have meant opening the membership of the G10 to a wider group of countries. The Australian government was instrumental in finding a way through the impasse by proposing the new arrangements to borrow as a new supplementary financing facility for the International Monetary Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NAB does not replace the GAB, so the G10 countries continue to maintain their exclusive club. But it is expected to be the IMF's supplementary financing facility of first and principal recourse. In recognition of Australia's role in establishing the NAB, it is expected that Australia will be the first chair of the group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has no budget implications. Any future payments made out of the consolidated revenue fund would be classified as a financial transaction and would therefore not affect either the headline or underlying budget balances. In effect, Australia would be making a loan to the IMF. Given the IMF's status, this would obviously be a very low risk transaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the bill proposes some minor changes to streamline the Australian government's financial dealings with the IMF. As it stands, the Commonwealth is currently required to make all its transactions in special drawing  rights&mdash;known as SDRs&mdash;with the IMF via the Reserve Bank. Under the new framework, special drawing rights will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5932"> bought and sold by the Commonwealth without the need to transfer to and from the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing my remarks, I certainly hope that in respect of the appointment of the chair of the first group&mdash;if, as I am informed, Australia is to be the first chair&mdash;we do not have the unedifying spectacle, and I believe totally inappropriate spectacle, we had recently of the appointment of then Senator Jim Short to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I would certainly seek some comments from the parliamentary secretary about the appointment process with respect to this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to once again acknowledge the role of our former Labor Treasurer, Ralph Willis, who did play a lead role on behalf of Australia in establishing these arrangements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R232">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  proposes measures, as we have just heard, to allow the Commonwealth to make about $1.5 billion available to the IMF. The IMF has potential to bring great relief and great benefit to the communities of the world. However, in its present position and with its present resources, it is really just the workhorse of the financially powerful nations and a diversion from their own financial policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF has come to prominence with the decline of bank lending and the decline in the ability of the developing nations to pay interest and the principal on their own loans. It is arguable that the banks recognise that they cannot enforce repayment of those loans. They need a third institution with international muscle which can enforce repayment and round up enough money to make ongoing repayments possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent examples in Mexico and Thailand illustrate this clearly. In Mexico, the banks loaned huge vats of money, about 80 per cent of their debt, and they were very possibly going to lose all of it. In stepped the IMF with a rescue plan and funds to add to the banks' emergency funds, and the Mexican economy was rescued. The salient factor in this example is that the IMF's contribution to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rescue package was about $1.3 billion, and that was partly our money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Thailand over the last few weeks, the $15 billion organised by the IMF is&mdash;to use the words of Peter Hartcher in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 August 1997&mdash;`aimed chiefly at protecting the assets of big banks and international lenders'. Mr Hartcher then goes on to say that the rescue `represents an attempt by the governments of the lending countries to use public resources to protect the assets and the interests of their private sectors'. Attached to this money are requirements for privatisation, tax reductions and the lifting of restrictions on the supply of offshore currency. We also have to ask ourselves why Thailand got into this trouble over their currency. That was not because of the machinations of other countries playing with their dollar. It was because their dollar became the plaything&mdash;as everybody's currency all over the world potentially is&mdash;of business and of currency speculators. I often wonder if in fact we should make the larger transnational corporations sign a few ILO agreements and basic human rights agreements, because they have far more power than many small countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is our money&mdash;and it is&mdash;we should make sure that it is being provided for a good purpose. The IMF has the potential to give money for many good purposes, and these amendments should ensure that our contributions to the IMF satisfy our humanitarian concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps another example is the goings&hyphen;on in Zaire. The IMF was a keen supporter of the now ex&hyphen;President Mobutu Sese Seko. His excesses are now legend as he lives off the benefits of his country and the trade supported by international sanction and financial support. We have most probably bought part of one of those European palaces for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we are also concerned that the objectives of the IMF in its present structure impose financial regimes on countries that do not march to the financial beat of the financially powerful nations. As a last resort of credit, countries are forced to comply with criteria that the IMF imposes to ensure free trade and comparative advantage or, more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5933"> precisely, to ensure the abolition of trade barriers. This is not necessarily to the advantage of the particular nation involved, and we have to recognise that so-called free trade has a good side and also a bad side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating here the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R232">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , another of those bills which goes to provide money to the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. Given the huge contention within the development community, international social justice organisations and among nations of the south about IMF loans and the conditions placed upon them, I think this bill can hardly be considered to be non&hyphen; contentious. It was the intention of the government to shove this through without debate at the end of last session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this particular bill is to provide funding for the NAB&mdash;the acronym for the `new arrangements to borrow'. The NAB is set up to get extra money for the IMF for really substantial bailouts of large economies. It comes as a result of the collapse of the Mexican economy, as was mentioned, a few years ago. The NAB allows the IMF to call upon member nations such as Australia to throw in extra contributions. This bill would authorise the Treasurer to take that money out of consolidated revenue or to borrow money in order to meet our obligation under the IMF. In our case the amount of money we are talking about is $1.5 billion, plus any amount extra that is needed should some members not be able to meet their obligations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that we do not need to pay if we cannot. This is true, but I cannot imagine Australia in any but the most extreme circumstances going to the IMF and saying, `We're in crisis and we would like to be audited in evidence that we really can't afford it.' No, I think we will make our contribution even if we have to borrow it. This bill gives that power to the Treasurer. It is not a new power in respect of IMF loans. At any moment the IMF can ask for $1.5 billion, and it will come out of consolidated revenue. This amount is more than the Commonwealth pays directly for secondary education, at a time when all sorts of sectors of the Australian community are being denied benefits, including higher education, because we do not have enough money.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government disingenuously says that this is only a loan, which is true. The money is nonetheless not here and available. For the five years until repayment we will have to find the money from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The authorisation of the power to take $1.5 billion from revenue, whenever it is asked, is not our primary objection to this bill. The real problems for the Greens are the purpose for which the money is lent and the implementation of that purpose. IMF loans are not loans without strings. They are not loans to help people or to aid development. Under schedule 4, item 10 of this bill it says that the loans will be made under the terms covered in article 5, section 3. This basically allows the IMF to impose so&hyphen;called economic discipline or structural adjustment policies on recipient nations as conditions of the loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such structural adjustment policies go by the acronym SAPs&mdash;these debates always seem to develop a certain amount of acronym mania. SAPs impose control over government policy by the International Money Fund. The effect of such control is to maximise export income and loan repayments, often at the expense of social welfare. A frequent result of IMF SAP conditions is that the recipient nation is forced to wind back programs for basic education and health, wind back minimum wage legislation and suffer increased unemployment and poverty. The other aspect of SAPs is that they usually have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5934"> conditions requiring the recipient nation to drop barriers to imports and overseas investment. Such barriers may have been designed to provide some minimal shelter for the development of indigenous industry or industries of national significance. They may have been designed to prevent abuses of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you several examples of these situations in my subsequent comments. First I would like to tell an illustrative joke. One day a man came to the door to find Fred, someone he knew as a person who was very active in the community, at the door. Fred explained that a member of the community had fallen on hard times and was unable to pay his debts. He was taking a collection to help this unfortunate. The man of the house was moved by Fred's charity and gave generously. As Fred was leaving he asked, `Fred, if it's not offensive, can you tell me the name of our unfortunate brother?' Fred replied, `The debtor is me.' A few months later Fred returned with a similar story of collecting for an unfortunate. The man was incensed and asked, `I suppose you are the poor person in question?' `No,' said Fred, `it is the poor farmer Susan.' Fred outlined her plight: a large and a demanding lender. The man again contributed generously saying, `I feel ashamed. I'm sorry I doubted you, Fred, but after last time I thought you might again be the debtor and the recipient of my charity.' `Ah, but I am the recipient; this time I am the creditor.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the IMF loans meant to serve? Many analysts looking at the loans and their outcomes have concluded that their purpose is to ensure lenders continue to receive a flow of cash from southern nations regardless of social and environmental costs or issues such as sovereignty. How cynical. The emphasis on export incomes rather than domestic production, the emphasis on loan repayment at the expense of social programs, the elements of coercion and imposition of policies that are domestically extremely unpopular are all evidence that the purpose of the IMF loans is not to serve the recipient nations. Of course, the entire thing is masked in economic fundamentalist rhetoric that states that only through 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the imposition of laissez&hyphen;faire capitalism can people actually get ahead through the mechanism of the trickle&hyphen;down theory. There are other ruder versions of that, but I am not going to mention them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results bear this out. The Special Rapporteur for the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Commission on Human Rights, Danilo Turk, who was given the job over a five&hyphen;year period of examining the impact of debt and SAPs, noted in paragraph 66 of his final report that southern debt was between $1.4 trillion and $1.45 trillion at the end of 1991&mdash;double its level at the beginning of the debt crisis in 1981. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the debt situation has resulted in an unprecedented reverse flow of financing from developing to the industrialised world. Total resource flows from the South to the North between 1982 and 1990 amounted to at least $US432 billion, equivalent to more than six Marshall Plans, evaluated in 1991 dollars. Between 1985 and 1990, Brazil paid out $54.5 billion more to its creditors than it received in new loans. According to the World Health Organisation, it would take slightly <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">less</EMPHASIS>  than that amount to provide safe water and sewers <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">for all of Latin America during the next decade</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IMF loans do not address the debt situation; they perpetuate it by attempting to force servicing of debts rather than addressing the fundamental inequity of the terms of debt. Debt, in being serviced, is often not discharged. Several studies&mdash;the Brandt report, the Brundtland report, the Turk report, the report of the Commission on Human Rights in 1992&mdash;have all outlined debt as a fundamental problem. They identify debt and the structure of lending&mdash;including the IMF and World Bank loans and their role in perpetuating the debt cycle&mdash;as a major source of poverty, inequity, environmental degradation, violation of human rights and what has been described as a recolonisation of the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of conditionality mentioned was the fact that IMF loans usually require opening the economy to international investment and imports and deregulation of the financial sector. This has several outcomes, including an increase in capital flight as barriers to taking money out of developing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5935"> countries are removed, and an increase in the importation of luxury goods. These are both consequences of the internal or intranational inequities in distribution of wealth. They are often exacerbated by unregulated foreign investment and the undermining by SAPs of policies to promote social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that at least a third of Latin America's debt problems would disappear if capital flight was prevented and reversed. Capital flight reduces the money in national savings to meet a country's own capital needs. Going to northern banks adds to the injury of the loss: the insult of being offered the money as foreign loans. In terms of the importation of luxury goods, the IMF is reported to have demanded deregulation of such areas as imported alcohol, toilet tissue and so on in a high level mission to Brasilia in August 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some argument might be possible that restrictions on imports of productive equipment are bad for a developing country, it can hardly be claimed that development is assisted by importing Johnny Walker! A third consequence is the displacement of development plans in favour of corporate plans. As an example, in India in 1964&hyphen;65, a famine was used by the US and the World Bank to impose liberalisation of investment terms on the Indian fertiliser industry as a condition of providing food aid.</PARA>

We do not believe that such a change should be entertained at a time when there is a major review of those rules taking place in secret, behind closed doors, under enormous pressure by the media organisations and the media magnates. We think it should all be out in the open and, if there are to be changes to the rules, there should be a public discussion before such changes are made.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5939"> investment. It is good news which is directly linked to the government's sensible and pragmatic decision on tariff arrangements for the car industry. These new arrangements announced by the Prime Minister on 6 June this year are designed to secure investment by the major car manufacturers in the lead&hyphen;up to the APEC free trade region in 2010.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by Toyota to make large scale, long&hyphen;term investment in Australia is confirmation of the success of the government's strategy for industry. Highlighting Toyota's decision will be the direct creation of 400 jobs and hundreds more indirectly. A doubling of exports of the Camry motor vehicle will be achieved by the year 2000. There will be $1 billion in new investment. There will also be the manufacture of a new V6 family car and the location of a research and development facility in Australia. Japan's leading car manufacturers have a very positive view of Australia and of the government's approach to industry. In fact, the President of Toyota, Mr Okuda, said at that announcement last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision on future policy arrangements signals a genuine commitment to the continued development of Australia's automotive manufacturing industry.</PARA>

This is something that the Labor Party never did when it was in office. We are very serious about providing the right climate for growth, increased competitiveness, increased exports and the creation of jobs. It is a commitment which we have but clearly the opposition does not have. Their comments after the Toyota announcement amount to little more than sour grapes, because we have just delivered more for the car industry in one decision than they had in 13 years.</PARA>

If there is anything that can be provided on those two matters, I imagine that you will hear about it in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the government is conscious of the need to take account of the impact of cuts, but what I think you continue to ignore&mdash;presumably because it suits your own political purposes&mdash;is that the government is committed to a new legislative framework which will ensure greater efficiency, greater accountability and, ultimately, better results for the public, whom the Public Service are meant to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked me about Dr Kemp's remarks yesterday. Dr Kemp was releasing a report by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, which had been commissioned by the Management Advisory Board and its Management Improvement Advisory Committee as part of achieving the cost-effective personnel service project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It found that the proportion of human resources staff to total organisation employees for public sector organisations surveyed was 3.98 per cent, whereas best practice in the private sector was 1.02 per cent. I do not know why you want to ignore these things. You somehow just want to throw your hands up and say, `Shock! Horror!' because there seems to be a significant disparity in the figures which suggests that there are much higher levels of inefficiency in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direct costs of delivering HR services in the APS agencies surveyed was, on average, two and a half times that of best practice. The finding was that it takes about four people in the Public Service to perform the same personnel functions that can be provided by one person in the private sector under best practice. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5941">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is my understanding of what Dr Kemp was saying yesterday. It seems to be a very valid point arising from those findings. It deals with the effectiveness of the provisions of human relations services to staff in the public sector. I think the finding is that, whilst the private sector has a strategic view of the role of human relations, in the public sector it is almost seen as an end in itself, and the obsession is with the inputs rather than the outputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you would be doing everyone a great service&mdash;including taxpayers and those who want to work in an efficient environment&mdash;if you focused on outcomes, rather than saying, `Shock! Horror! Isn't it tragic that a couple of jobs were lost,' irrespective of whether there might be very significant benefits to taxpayers, because the more you promote inefficiency in the public sector, or anywhere else involving public funding, the less capacity we have to deliver a whole range of very important social services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are not really interested in that, then I presume you are in the same boat as that crowd opposite who were happy to turn a blind eye to a $10 billion budget deficit and go on saying, `Hang on! We can find another area of need somewhere else where we would like money spent. We will not care about the bottom line. We'll just go on handing out the money.' That is how you put up taxes.

In view of the direct threat to 1,000 jobs in Burnie and Wesley Vale, and in view of the threat to 4,000 other jobs on the north&hyphen;west coast of regional Tasmania, what action can be taken to speed up the anti&hyphen;dumping inquiry process?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Senator Harradine's great interest in this matter as he has raised it with me previously, and I thank him for the notice that he gave me on the matter. At the outset, can I say that the government is well aware of the importance of the paper manufacturing plants at Burnie and Wesley Vale, which contribute an enormous amount, both in employment and purchases, to the Tasmanian economy. My Tasmanian Senate colleagues have brought this home to me as well. I am also well aware of the potential effect on paper manufacturing operations in Tasmania and the social impact that it may have on the community there should there be any dumping of coated wood&hyphen;free paper in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, can I say that the previous government allowed 245 days as the time frame for the investigation of a dumping complaint. My predecessor, Geoff Prosser, commissioned the Willett review and, as a consequence of the recommendations of that review, the time frame for investigation was reduced by 30 days to 215 days. This time frame for undertaking anti&hyphen;dumping investigations in Australia is very good when compared to other major practitioners. Australia's time frame for initiating dumping complaints and reaching a decision is a total of 215 days. This comprises 20 days for an initial examination to determine if a prima facie case exists, and then there are 85 days allowed for Customs to come to a preliminary finding. After that the matter then goes to the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority and that has a time frame of 110 days to make a final finding and then a recommendation to me. Currently the matter of dumping is on reference to the Productivity Commission and the terms of reference are being settled by the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, my colleague Minister Moore.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5943">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case we have a complaint by the Australian industry which manufactures coated wood&hyphen;free paper. It is against the exports of this paper from 14 countries in Asia, Europe and South Africa. The application for dumping notices was lodged with the Australian Customs Service on 19 June this year and on 9 July Customs initiated an investigation of the allegations made in the application. The time frame in this investigation has been extended from the normal 85 days to 120 days because of the complexity of undertaking concurrent inquiries in 14 countries. I might say that some of the inquiries involve Customs officers going to countries in Europe. Europe is now on holidays and this is making it very difficult to get information from those European countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what has to be found is that there has been dumping, then that there has been a material injury caused to the industry, and that the material injury has been caused by the dumping. In arriving at a decision we have to make investigations in countries as to the pricing of the goods concerned. Adding to the complexity is the fact that we are dealing with 14 countries and Customs will be visiting at least 22 companies. I can assure Senator Harradine that the Customs Service is using every facility available and I have asked them to examine in every way possible how this time frame may be shortened. Other than that I will keep Senator Harradine and those other senators interested as to the progress of this matter.</PARA></ANSWER>

As for resources, I can assure Senator Harradine that there are over 20 Customs officers involved in this investigation.

To get an answer from these European countries is very hard at this point in time.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Bolkus, for your question in relation to the tighter targeting of Abstudy introduced in this budget. What I indicated to the Senate yesterday stands. You are asking me now specifically about changes to Abstudy regulations. As I started to indicate to Senator Denman&mdash;I said I would come back to her but I will take the opportunity to give a little more information now; I will, nonetheless, come back to you, Senator Denman, fully&mdash;there were some savings to be made in relation to Abstudy in this budget. They were in the vicinity of $10 million a year which I think compares very favourably, if you like, to the sorts of expenditures that we are outlaying on indigenous education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That $10 million a year is made up of 13 individual changes, one of which I freely admit we have had some difficulty with. That relates to students travelling away from home for their courses. As soon as we realised that that was a problem for them, we were in discussions with the relevant institutions and I believe we are very close to resolving that situation. Senator Bob Collins raised it with me. I indicated to him, as I recall, that we were already on the job attempting to make sure that those institutions were not particularly disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I give you an idea of the sorts of changes that we have made, so that you understand why we made them. For example, students in Abstudy are entitled to compassionate travel&mdash;that is, to return home. That is a perfectly reasonable requirement on behalf of Abstudy students, but the government does not believe it is reasonable to not have a cap on that. For example, the number of trips that could be taken was unlimited. The government has put a cap on that and students will now be limited to two return trips a year for full&hyphen;time, away&hyphen;from&hyphen;home students; and compassionate travel cannot be used for students suspended from school and those attending away&hyphen;from&hyphen;base activities.

Independent and pensioner students who use travel entitlements for dependents will not be eligible for fare allowance during the year for themselves or for their dependents. Graduation travel will be limited to students approved for fare allowance to undertake their course away from their permanent home. These are all perfectly reasonable changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you went to the man in the street and said, `Do you believe the Abstudy entitlement should include an unlimited opportunity for compassionate leave to return home?' the answer would be, `No.' If you then said, `Do you think two trips a year is reasonable?' the answer, in my view, would unquestionably be, `Yes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an allowance in Abstudy for some ancillary expenses that I do not have the specific details on, but I will just give you this one example. The vast majority of Abstudy applicants taking advantage of that had ancillary expenses of under $2,000. As I am advised, there was a very small number&mdash;in the vicinity of 10 but, I think, fewer than that, sharing 87 or three&mdash;in the vicinity of $80,000. That is unreasonable. Nobody would expect that to continue. So a limitation of $2,000 was put on in the ancillary expenses.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5948"> special interest in the needs of the people who live around us, which have not always been accommodated in the past and, certainly, under the previous government did not get much attention. The youth allowance is a significant social policy reform, as I have said before in this place, and it is going to simplify and improve the income support arrangements for young Australians wherever they might live. It has many positive aspects, and I am pleased to note that many of them have been acknowledged by some of the welfare organisations I have consulted with as well as by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will be paid to more than half a million young Australians who are in education, training or jobsearch. For the overwhelming majority of young people currently receiving income support&mdash;about 378,000&mdash;their entitlements will not be changed under the youth allowance. In fact, many of them will be eligible for more assistance than they currently receive&mdash;by that I mean about 137,000 more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is all about providing incentives for young people to take up education and training opportunities because that is the best prospect for them to secure a job. We simply cannot continue to send a message to young people that they are better off on the dole than in education or training. Young people who leave school without any qualifications are three times more likely to be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will be particularly appreciated by families in regional Australia because it provides real incentive and support for young people living in regional and rural areas who might have to move away from home to take up education, training or look for work. This is not about keeping unwilling students in school. You can acquire job skills in a variety of ways. It is about providing incentives to take up appropriate education and/or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Kemp's plan for $550 million for at least 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships gives an indication of how committed we are to encouraging young people. Dr Kemp has said that 3,650 inquiries have already been received on the hotline about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new apprenticeship scheme, which he released under a national campaign. In one week that has been the interest from around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, some 70,000 young people who need to live away from home for study or jobsearch will be eligible for rent assistance, and that is up to a maximum of nearly $75 a fortnight. It will make a massive difference in the living standards of young people who have to go away to study or to work. The parental income cut-out point for a family with one dependent living away from home and getting the full rate of rent assistance will be $58,658, and that will increase for additional dependents. That is more generous than the current situation with Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people under 18 living away from home will also receive an increased rate of payment&mdash;and that means about 15,000 unemployed and 19,500 thousand students. Under the youth allowance, the requirement under Austudy for a minimum entitlement of $1,000 a year will be abolished, and that will help an estimated 41,200 students. The abolition of the education leaver waiting period will benefit another 19,900 former students. Youth allowance recipients will also be eligible for the remote area allowance and also for a pharmaceutical allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government on a number of occasions acknowledged the need to keep young people acquiring skills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Hogg asked me a question on the firearms buyback. The question he put had five parts to it. The first was: what does the government anticipate the spending for the final month of the firearms buyback will be? The answer to that is that it is not possible to give an accurate estimate, but advice from the states and territories indicates that up to an additional $50 million may be paid in compensation to individual firearm owners by the end of September. Each state and territory is also assessing claims for compensation for loss of business from licensed firearms dealers, and that assessment process will continue for several months. Because of the relatively complex nature of those assessments, it is now not possible to provide a final figure for compensation to be paid to firearms dealers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next two aspects of this question were in relation to the anticipation of a surplus from the Medicare levy and the size of that surplus. My advice is that, at this stage, because of the answer to the previous question, it is difficult to assess whether there will be a surplus and, if so, what size it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part of Senator Hogg's question related to the $63 million spent on administration. The government believes that the administration costs are not too high. These costs include not only the cost of administering the compensation program but also funding for new licensing and registration systems and for public education. These funds were provided by the Commonwealth in response to representation from the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final and fifth aspect of Senator Hogg's question was whether, when the government conducted an audited scheme, it would include an audit of the administration expenses incurred by state and territory governments. To that I can say, yes, part of the agreement with the states and territories for funding of their buyback and other systems was that there would be a final audit to ensure that the substantial taxpayer contribution to this process was properly spent.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5949"><TITLE>South Pacific Cruise Lines Ltd</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been contracts which were signed on 16 May between the department and this cruise line company to provide $2.8 million to the company for training at a rate which is exceptionally high, which is effectively providing this company with funding of $800 per trainee per week for a training program. That is an exceptionally high figure. Payments have been made&mdash;unacquitted advances to this company, a company which apparently has very little in terms of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Queensland parliament&mdash;I am surprised the minister has not been watching the Queensland parliament&mdash;it has been revealed that the shares in this company are held by individuals on behalf of another company. That company, which is known as Chancellor Australia Pty Ltd, was evicted from its Sydney premises in April of this year for failing to pay its rent. So the company that the Commonwealth is funding to the tune of $2.8 million is owned by a company that cannot afford to pay its rent and it has directors who have very, very dubious business backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister adverted to my comments about the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> today where the principals of the company admitted that they were seeking finance&mdash;I believe to the tune of $5 million&mdash;from US casinos for this operation. Apparently they cannot get it from traditional lenders, probably because there are not assets there to justify an investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ship that the company is pursuing, as I understand it, is not known as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alloura</EMPHASIS>&mdash;as they say. It is still in dry dock in Singa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pore, as of an inquiry on Monday. The authorities in Singapore are not aware of any intention to move it. But perhaps there is an intention&mdash;one never knows with these things. William Angliss, the trainer, said on 8 July that the ship might not materialise. The general manager of the company, Mr McGregor, announced that the vessel that they announced they had in February is the MS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alloura</EMPHASIS>, but it is not the same vessel. They have changed tack since they told the Queensland government&mdash;and apparently this department&mdash;that they had a vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in the Queensland parliament Mr Davidson, the Minister for Tourism, stated that an agreement had been struck by the shipping line, South Pacific Cruise Lines, and DEETYA, for about $2.7 million. We know it is $2.8 million. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that there has been a further allocation of funding to South Pacific Cruise Lines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the same matter; that is, the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in response to Senator O'Brien's question today. I think it raises very serious concerns about accountability, and the accountability of the minister to this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has within her portfolio allocated $2.8 million of taxpayers' money to a private company with no corporate record and with directors who have extremely questionable backgrounds to their business dealings. The minister has been unable to account to this parliament the measures taken to ensure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5951"> that that money has been spent correctly and that taxpayers have got value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if the minister has not had warning of this issue. The money was handed over to this company&mdash;$2.8 million of taxpayers' money&mdash;on 5 June this year. As early as 11 June concern was raised in the Queensland press about the qualifications of the directors of this company to receive public funds, given their corporate record. Since that time there has been a range of speculation and concern raised within the Queensland parliament and by the press in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 August this year, Senator O'Brien and I both raised with the minister our concerns about the expenditure of this money. We asked her and her department to account for their actions in relation to this grant. The minister was unable to assist us. The department, unlike its usual high standards of competence, was unable to give satisfactory responses as to their handling of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, Senator O'Brien quite rightly sought to pursue that matter with the minister, and asked for her explanation as to the expenditure of these funds. Not only did he raise the concerns that have been raised in the press and raised by Senator O'Brien and me at estimates, he raised a further allegation. The allegation is based on information we have received that, in addition to the $2.8 million already allocated to this firm, since that time the minister and/or the department has approved even further funds to be given to this company. They have thrown good money after bad, it seems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite unacceptable for the minister to fail to provide an answer to Senator O'Brien's question. She has had, as I say, since estimates on 19 August to address the concerns raised with her. Her department admits they have been aware of concern about the bona fides of the directors involved in this company since 11 June. It really is unacceptable that the minister is not able to provide answers about what has  happened to the taxpayers' money and what processes have been put in place by her to ensure proper accountability for that money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This money has been allocated as a grant from a program called training for employment; the idea being that the training funds are provided by the government in return for a guarantee of jobs&mdash;jobs for young people in Queensland. It seems unlikely that the company will be able to provide those jobs. If they default on that contract that money has largely been wasted. We want to know what the minister is doing about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not been unreasonable. We have asked her at every opportunity to investigate and report back to the parliament. She keeps ducking the issue. The buck stops with Senator Vanstone: at least $2.8 million of taxpayers' money; an allegation that either she or the department has approved even further funds; no explanation about what checks were made into the bona fides of this company; what guarantees there are about the use of the money and the protection of the taxpayers' interests; what action the minister has taken to ensure proper processes; and what action she has taken to allay concerns raised at estimates about those processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, the department could not provide a satisfactory explanation of their processes before they handed over $2.8 million of taxpayers' money. The best they could say was that they did a company search and that the company was a listed company. It had only been in formation, I think, since December last year. The company does not have the necessary company record or financial base to be involved in the sort of exercise that they embarked upon. Now Senator O'Brien has raised very serious concerns about the bona fides of the directors; bona fides that would have every Australian, I think, most concerned about this use of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister must be held accountable. She must come into this parliament today, in my view, and provide answers. That is not unreasonable. If more money has been allocated to this company since these concerns have been raised, the minister will be hard pressed to defend her actions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Its publication reflects the government's commitment to a foreign and trade policy which the Australian community understands and supports.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This White Paper puts the national interests of Australia squarely at the centre of Australian foreign and trade policy.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Its fundamental message is that, in all that it does in foreign and trade policy, the government will apply a basic test of national interest:  does it advance  the security of the Australian nation, and the jobs and standard of living of the Australian people. The answers to these specific questions must always be yes.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A clear sense of the national interest, an understanding of what is important for Australians and confidence in the capacity of Australia to shape its future internationally define this government's approach to foreign and trade policy.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The starting point of this White Paper is that an active foreign and trade policy is crucial to Australia's future security and prosperity.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It is crucial because Australia has global interests. It is part of the global economy. Its prosperity is tied to its performance as a trading nation. Its security is closely tied to the security of its neighbourhood. But our horizons must extend well beyond our immediate region. This is the experience of our past and it is the key to our future. For Australia, the alternative to a foreign and trade policy of broad scope is irrelevance and decline.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The policies and strategies set out in this White Paper represent both change and continuity.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The national interest does not change with a change of government. The priority accorded to the Asia Pacific, the commitment to further trade liberalisation, and the strong support for the World Trade Organisation and APEC are among the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5953"> important elements of continuity in the government's policy framework.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They have been continued precisely because they advance Australia's interests.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In other areas, however, this government will continue to rebalance and refocus Australia's foreign and trade policy so that Australia's interests are more effectively advanced.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A feature of the government's approach to foreign and trade policy is the importance it places on bilateral relationships as a means of advancing Australian interests. Strong bilateral relationships are not an alternative to regional and global efforts, but they are the basic building block for effective regional and global strategies.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In pursuing these strategies the government will continue to accord the Asia Pacific its highest priority. This document is our declaration of commitment to our neighbourhood as we begin what will surely be the Asia Pacific century. It reflects the weight of Australian interests which are engaged with the Asia Pacific:  with the region's three major powers and largest economies&mdash;the United States, Japan and China&mdash;and with our largest near neighbour&mdash;Indonesia. It reflects the significant Australian interests which are engaged in Australia's relationships with the other ASEAN states, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. It reflects the effort and priority we have attached to Australia's relationships with PNG and the other island states of the South Pacific. And it reflects the initiatives this government has taken to deepen Australia's ties with South Asia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Linked to the government's focus on bilateral relations is a more selective approach to the multilateral agenda. Australia must concentrate its involvement in multilateral issues on those areas where its national interests are closely engaged.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National interests cannot be pursued without regard to the values of the Australian community, including its support for fundamental human rights.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central to these values is an unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating discrimination. Racial discrimination is despicable whether it is overt or clothed in isolationist nostalgia. The rejection of racial discrimination is a moral issue of the first order and it is fundamental to Australia's engagement with the region where its vital security and economic interests lie.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This White Paper is also about the confidence Australia should have in its capacity to shape its future.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians should not underestimate the assets which characterise modern Australia. Ours is among the most East Asian oriented economies in the world; an economy larger than any in South East Asia. Our objective is to build a partnership

This is the jobs foreign and trade policy. Nothing else will do. Our commitment to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region  and the priority we give it will ensure that thousands of jobs are created for all working&hyphen;age Australians, and of even more concern to them, real jobs for their children. Real security means more than the defence of our borders. It also means the chance of jobs and a decent standard of living for all Australians.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The government's strategy for advancing Australia's security interests is based on a hard&hyphen;headed assessment of the security of the Asia Pacific region. Its key components are maintaining a strong national defence capability, the alliance relationship with the United States, expanding Australia's bilateral, regional and multilateral security links&mdash;including through expanded security dialogues&mdash;a task on which the government has recently made great progress&mdash;and strengthening Asia Pacific&hyphen;wide regional security institutions of which the ASEAN Regional Forum is the most significant. The government will also be working to ensure that the international regimes covering weapons of mass destruction&mdash;nuclear, chemical and biological&mdash;are implemented and, where necessary, strengthened. One of the government's proudest achievements was the key role we played in bringing to life the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The government's trade strategies will focus on bilateral efforts, APEC, and the World Trade Organisation. Each has a contribution to make to increasing Australia's standard of living through expanded trade and investment.

This is located 120 kilometres south-east of Darwin and comprises l 14,000 hectares.

For example, the restoration of the seriously degraded Puckapunyal Training Area in Victoria which has taken place over three decades has, according to Defence, produced a remarkable result.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I seek support for this motion in the Senate from government members as well as members of the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, so that this Senate, a chamber that represents the states of Australia, can speak with one voice about jobs in an important industry sector for Australia, an industry sector which is employment rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, by and large, a labour intensive sector of the Australian economy. It is also a sector which has, as a distinguishing feature, its presence in regional Australia. Industries in the textile, clothing and footwear sector relate closely to the primary production of cotton, wool and other fibres. They are, therefore, not surprisingly found in major rural centres of Australia and help underpin the nature of rural employment and the development of rural and regional economies in our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plight of regional Australia is one which is not often debated in this chamber. There is a tendency here to talk in macro terms at a national level. But if one looks at regional Australia, there is a lack of development in that part of the nation, with a worryingly high level of unemployment which means that anything that adversely affects its interests damages the national good in a severe way. But, more importantly, it continues the sense of isolation from capital cities that rural Australia feels and the hopelessness that job seekers feel being confined geographically to their region with little capacity to move out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The textile, clothing and footwear industries have those two significant characteristics which, when you consider them against Australia's principal and major economic concern&mdash;the level of unemployment&mdash;have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a particularly telling force in dealing with issues of protection and industry assistance for this important sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn in a moment to the Industry Commission's report on the textile, clothing and footwear industries. This report was brought down by the Industry Commission to recommend to government steps that should be taken, in the Industry Commission's charter, to&mdash;as the Industry Commission would put it&mdash;reform this sector. This is a report that has created massive unease within this industry, not only among the workers in this industry but also among the employers. This is a report which has come at a time when a major underwear manufacturer, Berlei, has announced that it is moving offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a report whose timing has coincided with the announcement of other exits from Australia of major companies and also small companies in this industry sector. In short, it is a report whose timing, in terms of when it was brought down, coincides with a reduction in employment opportunity and manufacturing capacity in this sector. It is a report which finds that there would be more widespread unemployment if the findings of it were implemented further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way that anyone can look at this report and the future of this sector is through the needs of this economy to grow, to create lasting jobs and to be more competitive. It is the contention of the opposition that this report, if implemented, would not do that. It would reduce opportunities, reduce jobs, and reduce the capacity of industry to make the transition to a more competitive base which would secure the future for it in the foreseeable period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to a detailed analysis of the Industry Commission's report, might I say that at question time today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You don't mean the report; you mean the draft report, don't you?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mean the draft report, Senator, and I thank you for the correction. The draft report is what is available to the public for comment now. But having sat in cabinet, can I say that there is often very little 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5958"> difference between what is exposed for public comment as the draft report and what, after hearing public comment, becomes the final report and the report upon which governments adjudicate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me not be thrown off what I was saying. In question time today, Senator Hill attacked me for statements that I had made as industry minister. Those statements related to a reduction in protection for various industry sectors and a growth of competitiveness of Australian industry. On page 8 of the white paper tabled today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the National Interest&mdash;Australia's Foreign and Trade Policy</EMPHASIS> there is a time series graph which I hold now for display in the chamber. This graph actually emphasises my point and proves the contention that I was making. The red line shows growth in export capability from Australia. The yellow line shows the reduction in protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was said in a cheap way by the Leader of the Government in the Senate that there was something inconsistent about the Labor Party's position on this issue. I want to say that there is nothing inconsistent about the Labor Party's position on this issue. The questions of industry adjustment and industry competitiveness are fundamental questions for intelligent debate in this country. Unfortunately, it is impossible to have an intelligent debate if one side&mdash;in this case, the government&mdash;insists on being dumb and unintelligent about what that issues are that are required in terms of adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the motion I have moved should be carried and that there should be a pause in tariff reductions. It has been said that that is inconsistent with what we were saying when we were in government. When we were in government we had a series of industry policies and programs to support this industry, to protect employment, to offer retraining opportunities for people thrown out of employment who need to make an adjustment for new jobs, to provide assistance for the acquisition of capital equipment to make the industry more efficient, to encourage the industry to grow, and to open export markets for this industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the industry is an exporter. The total value of exports from the textile, clothing and footwear sector in Australia over the last year was in the realm of $500 million, equivalent to the amount of wine exported out of this country&mdash;a fact that most people do not appreciate. This is increasingly a sophisticated, highly skilled sector that is engaging in top end of the market production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to make those adjustments, you need the supports to have regard to developing the skill levels higher, to developing greater employment security, to offer incentives for the maintenance of production facilities onshore and not wave them goodbye on the dock as they flee overseas, to help regional Australia meet the particular needs of those industry sectors in their regions as well, and to provide investment so that there can be a basis for reinvestment in this industry and its competitiveness can rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had those programs in place. In the 1996-97 budget, the first budget of this government, those programs were substantially abolished. Programs that offered job security were thrown out the window. Programs that took a particular approach to encouraging research and development were thrown out the window. Export incentives were removed or reduced. Job insecurity was enhanced by removing regional initiatives as well. A whole raft of things that help in the transition of an industry, that work with the industry and that assist the people in the industry and meet their needs were removed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You reduced the supports necessary for this industry to reinvest and develop, and you did a range of other things like that. No wonder companies say that they have no faith in you. No wonder they choose what they regard as more congenial investment climates overseas. That is a travesty and is close to a traitorous act by this government&mdash;traitorous to Australian workers, traitorous to Australian industry and traitorous to our capacity as a nation to be competitive in an area and a sector in which we are world class.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not come to me about what we have done. We had a holistic program. You have chopped away the supports and the struts of that program and want to blindly go barrelling on down the road to more and more tariff cuts without any basis for this industry to make adjustment and without any concern for the human needs of the workers in this industry to be able to look forward to some prospect of job security for themselves in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission brought down its report on 30 June this year and, as has been pointed out, that is its draft report. A final report on this industry is due in September. A key recommendation of the report was to reduce all TCF tariffs to five per cent by the year 2008 by continuing the current schedule beyond the year 2000, regardless&mdash;and this is my emphasis&mdash;of what our competitors do. That means that Australia unilaterally disarms itself while other nations do not move to remove protection for their industries, leaving us, given the changes that have been made by this government, to face the fierceness of international competition without the necessary levels of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation was as above for clothing and footwear, but with intermediate goods&mdash;fabrics and yarns&mdash;reduced to zero in 2001 and a compensatory bounty 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> applied to these goods, reducing from 10 per cent in 2001 to two per cent in 2008. That is option number two. We know what happens with bounties with this government. This government says, `The bounty cost is too high. It is an outgoing expense on the outlays side of the budget. We will cut those too.' Any industry sector in receipt of a bounty is on notice that that is a temporary thing. As soon as the cost cutters of Treasury can get their hands on it, so too will that benefit go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recommendation of the report is to end the import credit scheme on 30 June in the year 2000. That scheme has served this industry well and it is necessary to encourage a competitive industry to export&mdash;something that the government has done in the case of the automobile industry. But despite the government's decision there&mdash;a decision made by the government at the urging of the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACDONALD" NAMEID="YW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You had no part in it at all.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take that interjection, that we had no part in it. For the record, Kim Beazley and Simon Crean went to Adelaide before the government made its announcement and put down their plan on the Australian automotive industry&mdash;this was a key feature of it. When the Prime Minister was finally dragooned into our position, of course he did not acknowledge it but, nonetheless, substantially adopted all the points we had proposed. The point I make here is that the import credit scheme is fundamental to this industry sector becoming internationally competitive. The Industry Commission report recommends its abolition on 30 June 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back to the report: it also recommends no further review of assistance for the industry and no further sectoral assistance to the industry; that is to say, the gate is slammed shut. While there was no formal dissenting report, the agreement of Mr Phillip Brass, who was the industry representative on the panel, was conditional on there being a bounty applying to all TCF value&hyphen;added reducing from five per cent in 2001&hyphen;02 to two per cent in 2004. The commission argued that its recommendations will directly lead&mdash;this seems to have escaped the attention of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5960"> government&mdash;to 5,000 job losses in the industry; that is, 5,000 jobs out of a current employment level of 96,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also notes that a GST would damage the industry because a large proportion of the companies are so small that they are exempt from payroll tax and most TCF goods are exempt from wholesale sales tax. The government's flirtation with bringing back the GST is, again&mdash;this time by the Industry Commission&mdash;revealed as a direct threat to this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having noted the recommendations in this report, there are a number of observations that can be made. The first is that, in reality, it is not 5,000 but about 100,000 Australian textiles, clothing and footwear workers who stand to lose their jobs if the Productivity Commission's recommendations are adopted by the Howard government. At least 50,000 of these Australian jobs will go offshore and many of the remaining workers will be forced into low&hyphen;paid backyard operations. In 1994&hyphen;95 the TCF industries accounted for five per cent of total manufacturing employment&mdash;these are in similar proportions in other OECD countries. That level of employment would fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TCF industries encompass a diverse range of activities. Firms within the industry operate in a variety of different markets and with varying levels of vertical integration; that is, links between various stages of production such as spinning and weaving. Many firms are also involved in horizontal integration; that is, links between different types of TCF products, such as making both industrial and household textiles. The majority of these firms are located in Victoria and New South Wales, although many of these factories are located in outer regional centres&mdash;DuPont in Bayswater in outer eastern Melbourne, and Berlei in Lithgow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying: if the government is dinkum about this industry, if it has a scintilla of concern about the future of the workers and the development of Australian industry, it will vote for the motion which I have moved in this chamber. If it does not vote for it, workers and industry people in Australia will see exactly where this government stands. This is an opportunity not to hide behind your 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hands but to come out in the open and declare your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope you do better than the minister and the department have done because, despite massive cuts in assistance to industry programs in Australia in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism underspent their budget allocation by $131 million. An allocation of $7 million was made in assistance to textiles, clothing and footwear but they spent only $3.3 million. They could not spend the other $3.7 million, not because there was not a need but because the government's own cutbacks in staffing meant that they could not get the assistance where it was needed&mdash;at the coal face, to the workers and to the companies concerned in this sector. That is an example of performance which has sabotaged this industry as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Senate supports this motion. If it does not, it will be a blow for job security and justice for this industry sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What point are you making?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just quote back to you a couple of things that you said while you were minister, Senator Cook. Before I do, I will start with a quote from the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. On 15 May 1995, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We have really opened the economy up. We started reducing tariffs in 1988 and they will be at 5% by 1997, that is 2 years time. National economic policy is savoured. So tariff reductions work you do it in your own best interests.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then in 1994, when referring to motor vehicles, Senator Cook, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It was said that if tariff reform was attempted in these areas&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the transport sector, including manufactures of motor vehicles&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">both sectors would be killed off entirely.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They have not been; they are flourishing. Then on 7 June in 1995, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">If we had left the tariff wall intact, the old poor quality, high&hyphen;priced, inefficient Australian vehicle would have been overwhelmed and we would have no car industry now.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then in November 1995, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Therefore, our thrust as government has been to push for opening up the economy, internationalising it through tariff change . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1994, on sectoral assistance, Senator Cook, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I am not a fan of sectoral planning.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Cook, have you changed your mind? If you were not a fan of sectoral planning in 1994, what are you now? Senator Cook, on the area of assistance, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I must repeat, however, what my predecessors have said: The era of "handout" mentality is dead.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . As a Government we are committed to tariff reductions and continuing micro-economic reform. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Our task is to further the internationalisation of the economy and to consolidate and build further on our export success.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . Our focus will therefore increasingly be on best practice, bench marking and the demonstration effect of successful business.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, Senator Cook, it is no wonder that you tackled today's notice of motion with such little enthusiasm in the light of the statements that you have made in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talked about the draft report. The Industry Commission's final report on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries is due out on 9 September. The government then will be making its final recommendations. It has not taken a decision. Exactly the same attitude is being taken by you and some irresponsible members of your party and other parties; that is, to try to force the government into a position before the Industry Commission has even put its final report down. That is due on 9 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is meeting with joint delegations of unions and representatives of companies involved in the textile industry in Sydney on Friday. He will then meet with another delegation next week. Senator Cook, that is how this matter should be handled, not with a cheap shot through a general business notice of motion such as you have done today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to remember one or two things, Senator Cook, because you mentioned the DuPont situation. We need to remember what you said when you talked about your handout mentality and the things that have happened before. You only need to read today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, and I will quote from an article there. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The chemical giant that will cut Australian operations and slash 160 jobs was paid almost $60 million in government aid to keep manufacturing textiles as tariffs were reduced to zero.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were paid $60 million in government aid in order to keep manufacturing textiles. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agreement DuPont made with Labor in mid-1990 promised its newly acquired Fibremakers synthetic fibremaking business would operate without the benefits of tariff protection or bounties in a trade-off for a $59.34 million cash handout. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5962">  </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">DuPont was the first company to apply under the capitalisation grants program, gaining the largest share of the $141 million paid out to firms under the scheme.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, Senator Cook, in moving this motion, you choose to ignore the facts as they are presented there today. You choose to ignore that and highlight that it is a decision of this government that is costing 160 jobs when, in fact, no decision has been made by this government. Up to now, DuPont have made all of their decisions working on the tariff regime that your government put in place. They also had the hide to accept $60 million of government aid on a promise that, as a trade-off, they would operate without the benefits of tariff protection or bounties in order to receive this handout. The then Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Simon Crean, at that time in June 1990 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">To assist in integrating Australia into the global synthetic fibre market, the Government has approved a one-off, after&hyphen;tax grant of $36.2 million to Du Pont . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was just the first tranche of aid to DuPont. So do not bring up DuPont as an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard your colleague Mr Crean in the other place talking about how 160 people at DuPont would not be happy after the government's actions of this week. Let me say that the 160 people at DuPont want to remember that they received $60 million of aid to carry them through this process of a reduction of tariffs and the removal of bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DuPont was only acting under the rules as they were set out by the Labor Party. They were no-one else's rules&mdash;not the Industry Commission's recommendations in the draft report, nor the coalition's tariff regime. If DuPont were serious, it ought to wait for the final decision of the government on the TCF industries and not close its Bayswater plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had Berlei's decision, which has been mentioned over the past week, to move their manufacturing offshore, which affects over 200 workers in Lithgow. That decision was made under the tariff regime that was put in place by the Labor government&mdash;no other government&mdash;because the tariff regime has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not changed. So that decision was made because of decisions that were taken when you were in government, and it has nothing to do with decisions that this government has made or might make in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make one or two comments about the government's position. Only yesterday, 27 August, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assured workers in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries that the government had taken their concerns on board. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . when the government receives the final report, it will take a speedy decision&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">it is not going to hang around and leave people wondering what is going to happen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">as it did with the motor manufacturing industry. And in taking that decision, it will certainly pay very strong regard to the interests of employees in the industry.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I regard the closure of factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the employees, a tragedy for the City of Lithgow, but a tragedy for the region.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So let me say that the Labor Party is being totally hypocritical in its stance by calling for tariff protection now. When it was in government, the arguments focused on no more government handouts.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COOK" NAMEID="RF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You never mentioned a freeze when you were in government. When in government did you ever talk about a tariffs freeze? I am very pleased that Senator Murray will be speaking afterwards, because I know Senator Murray's position on this: he will see through your arguments and your telling this present government what it should do today when you had 13 years to do something about it&mdash;and still saw jobs slip away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your situation has changed because you lost an election. Some of the people on your backbench&mdash;those new Young Turks that are talked about so often&mdash;want to change the direction the Labor Party is going in, and they want to bring us back to the bad old days. Senator Cook, I understand your lack of enthusiasm for this motion, because I heard you speak so enthusiastically from this side. You did so on many occasions with the full 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5963"> support of the then opposition, the Liberal Party, who approved of and supported what you were doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enthusiasm you showed for this industry while you were on this side was appreciated but now that you have gone to the opposition benches I can understand your lack of enthusiasm: you had a chance to do something about it and you did nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your shadow industry minister Simon Crean is calling for the exact opposite of what the then Labor government was calling for. Just two weeks ago he was calling for direct government involvement&mdash;exactly the opposite what you wanted. Calling for direct government involvement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I think that if you look at a number of the programs that Labor put in place&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he was talking about the MTIA report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">this report (MTIA) says that many of them were very effective.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What we've got to have a suite of potential programs which have identified the barriers, having got a commitment from industry that if they get the assistance they will invest, they will create jobs, they expand exports&mdash;it's that commitment from them that really has to be the driving force to qualify for any assistance.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">DuPont got that assistance from this government from 1990 onwards. What have they done? They have turned their backs on that assistance, gone back on the agreement and decided that they are going to move offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, you and your shadow industry spokesman, Simon Crean, have the gall to suggest that it is this government that is responsible for the loss of those 160 jobs at DuPont. Mr Crean has had a few other things to say, which I think are worth quoting. Of Labor's policy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">No one understands better than Labor how that the tariff war has been fought and won. After all it was Labor that fought and won it.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You fought it and started to win it, and now you are trying to abandon it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor is not proposing to restore the high tariffs barriers of the past or keep them at existing levels indefinitely.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Instead we are seeking firm commitments from the textile, clothing and footwear industries on jobs, new investment and increased exports. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If DuPont is any example of what government handouts or assistance to industry can do&mdash;and the assistance that was given by your government&mdash;to ensure that this company stayed in Australia and maintained its fabric making operations here, then I can say that it is one of the greatest failures that you have ever seen. If you think that those things will be easily forgotten, I can tell you that they will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of colleagues who wish to make many points in regard to the issues you have raised. I look forward with interest to what Senator Murray has to say because, having been involved with him on a number of industry inquiries, I know his position on a number of issues. It will be interesting to see what his reaction is to the sort of thing that has happened in the case of DuPont where decisions were taken by the previous government&mdash;where agreements were made and still did not work because this company has now decided that it will move offshore and 160 employees will lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with interest this motion that we are debating today and I go back to where I started. In moving this motion, Senator Cook talked about the 100,000 Australian textile, clothing and footwear workers whose jobs must be secured. I remind him that he is now changing direction on the issue of tariffs, high protection, quotas and all of those other issues which he tackled&mdash;quite fairly and harshly&mdash;when in government. Senator Cook, how many jobs were lost during your term in government&mdash;and here you are now talking about potential job losses in the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that Australia is well ahead of its international competitors in the reduction of tariffs in this industry. Why did you not say that 18 months ago? If we are so far ahead today, we must have been ahead 18 months ago. If that was the situation you should have made it quite clear then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge people to oppose this motion, partly because I think that the motion is ill conceived&mdash;because of a lack of enthusiasm by Senator Cook for this motion. Although he moved the motion, it goes completely against all the conditions that were put in place by the previous government. They have done an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5964"> enormous backflip on this issue. For that reason, and for many others which will be explained by my colleagues when they speak to this motion, I urge senators to vote against it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(d) there should be a freeze on TCF tariff reductions, effective immediately;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Ferguson was quite right: my party and I do have a long, consistent record of differing with the major parties on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this motion by the Labor Party concerning the TCF tariff cuts. I warmly welcome Labor's much improved tariff policy. I only hope that they improve it a lot more. I can only say that the Labor Party are the latter&hyphen;day saints of tariff reductions. They seem to have suddenly discovered that unilateral tariff reductions mean job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats' position has always been that tariff cuts must be measured against our competitors. For a decade and a half of Labor government it was the Australian Democrats alone who strongly opposed the unilateral cuts in tariffs and quotas pursued and implemented by Labor, all of them fully supported by the coalition. There is no inconsistency in the coalition's position. Labor is changing, and we are delighted to see it. Senator Cook was quite right in saying that the government adopted Labor's position on the car industry. The Australian Democrats' position was for a freeze now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact the coalition has always followed Labor on tariff policy. The coalition cannot escape the blame either. They are all now cheering about how they halted tariff cuts in the car industry, what a good decision they made and how clever they have been in completely ignoring the Productivity Commission on that matter. When I listened to Senator Alston today gloating when 17,000 more job losses are expected in the Public Service, I was reminded of what a cold, hard&hyphen;hearted, money&hyphen;mad cabinet he is a member of. When 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they changed car policy it was votes and elections they were worried about, not people and their lives. It was the coalition which when they were in opposition wholeheartedly supported Labor's destructive unilateral tariff policies and cheered them on from the sidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor government, with coalition support, do for the TCF industries and employees? It is thanks to the Labor Party that tariff reductions in the TCF industries are legislated until the year 2000. Surely, it is obvious that certainty of that kind needs to be tempered by an ability to adjust to competition and competitors. Unilateral is just not smart. I have found it very difficult to understand why anyone should have legislated us into a bind where we are forced to reduce tariffs on this basis. Tariffs in the TCF industries are currently at a maximum rate of 34 per cent, but they are multiple rates, depending on the particular product, and some are much lower. By the year 2000 they will be at a maximum rate of 25 per cent generally, but others will be lower. Tariffs in the TCF industries are currently falling at a rate of three per cent a year. By the year 2000, as I said, they will be 25 per cent, on average. These reductions are set to take place irrespective of what our trading partners do and irrespective of their impact on employment and investment in Australia. It really was a stupid law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says it is okay to cut unilaterally until 2000, but not after that. Why? Either it is right to cut unilaterally or it is not right to cut unilaterally. I am always surprised, when faced with the intelligence of people such as Senator Cook and Simon Crean&mdash;extremely capable people&mdash;why they cannot understand that to choose a date and to say that it is okay to be unilateral up to that date, but after that it is suddenly wrong, does strike people as a very strange approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition are right to be cross with their old tariff buddies, Labor. If a Labor government reduces tariffs somehow magically, our industries and jobs are going to be immune. But now that we have a coalition government which reduces tariffs, then devastation is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5965"> threatened. Our view is that devastation was always threatened under either party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Labor Party that it does not matter which party pursues unilateral tariff cuts, the outcome is the same, and that you must stop unilateral tariff cuts now. The outcome is bad for Australia. The TCF industries directly employ up to 100,000 people and a further equivalent number of outworkers. Hundreds of thousands of other employees are indirectly affected. You will recall that when 2,000 employees were advised that their services were to be terminated at BHP, 8,000 additional employees were affected. This affects far  more Australians than just the 100,000 conventionally spoken about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Liberal, Labor and National parties are fundamentally opposed to halting or even reviewing the TCF tariff cuts, which have been set in place until the year 2000. They are only open to negotiate tariffs after the year 2000, and by then it may already be too late. Why is it too late? Because the industries and the companies are closing now. The jobs are being lost now&mdash;not in the year 2000, now. Berlei has announced that it is going offshore and that is a disaster for the workers and people of Lithgow. But Berlei has made its announcement now. It has announced it under a regime of tariff reductions passed and implemented by Labor with the support of the coalition. The same goes for the decisions to close manufacturing plants by Gloweave and DuPont now, not in 2000. Those closures are happening now under the regime of unilateral tariff reductions implemented by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Labor is serious about revisiting its stance on tariffs, if it has learnt from the lessons of the past, then why not review the unilateral reductions in tariffs that are set to occur until the year 2000? Why won't you call for a freeze on tariff cuts now? Where is the intellectual, empirical or sensible economic justification for picking the year 2000? It makes no sense to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says tariffs should be frozen at year 2000 levels, at least until the year 2005. Now they are picking another year. Why? Why not adopt a policy that you evaluate what your competitors are doing? Sometimes your 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitors will go up; sometimes they will go down. But it should be relative to your market position, domestically and internationally. It is just not good enough in terms of your current policy. If you are serious about protecting jobs, then tariffs should be frozen at current levels and there should be no reductions in TCF tariffs unless reciprocal reductions are forthcoming from our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tariff cuts pursued by Labor went far beyond our obligations under the World Trade Organisation. Moreover, they were undertaken without similar measures by our trading partners who have continued to protect their industries by tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers. They must be saying out there in the wide world, `Wow! Those Aussies are really nice people, but they are pretty dumb.' How can we be so dumb as to give away our competitive advantage in that way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These Labor policies, supported by the coalition, have placed Australian manufacturers and workers at a disadvantage to overseas firms operating with strong tariff and non&hyphen;tariff assistance, and which have significantly lower labour, environmental and occupational health and safety standards. These economic rationalist policies were responsible for flooding Australia with cheap imports, for decimating Australian industry, for countless job losses, and for huge national debt increases. They were bad policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of Australia's major parties seem to again agree that tariffs can be reduced on a quid pro quo basis. That is the new accord, the new pact, between them on this matter. Yet unilateral tariff reductions are still legislated until the year 2000 for two major industries directly employing tens of thousands of Australians. That is when we have eight per cent recorded unemployment&mdash;I am one of those who thinks it is far higher&mdash;and growing long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of tariff assistance for the car industry is set to fall from the present 22&half; per cent to 15 per cent. The maximum rate of assistance for the textile, clothing and footwear industries is set to fall from 34 per cent to 25 per cent. The general rate of assistance for most other industries is currently set at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5966"> five per cent. In many other instances, this is significantly lower compared to that of our major trading partners. Why the National Party allowed their own constituency to be thumped with the tariff decreases in that sector is beyond us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of tariff rates beyond the year 2000 for the textile, clothing and footwear industries is to be decided by the parliament later this year. The ideologically blinkered Productivity Commission&mdash;known as the old `Industry Assassination Commission'&mdash;has recommended they fall to five per cent by 2005. They want to sign their death warrant. This recommendation has to be ignored. I project that it will be ignored, but we must go further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program tariff cuts in both the TCF and car industries from December 1996 to the year 2000 would have cost us $2 billion in lost revenue. Tariffs are taxes. They are no different in the tax regime than any other tax that we have. When you cut them, you lose revenue. This saving of $2 billion should be ploughed into industrial development programs targeted at generating jobs and export opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been engaged in trade liberalisation negotiations and should continue to do so. However, further trade reductions must only occur if reciprocal trade liberalisations are pursued by our major trading partners. Australia must no longer proceed with tariff reductions further than what is required in the multilateral agreements unless our trading partners do likewise and also address the use of non&hyphen;tariff barriers. So-called unilateral disarmament must cease immediately, not just after the year 2000, as the ALP and coalition are advocating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should produce comparative reports on tariff and non-tariff barriers between Australia and our major trading partners. It should ensure these are prepared on an annual basis as a service to the community and as a source of information for policy formulation, because you cannot evaluate the effect of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on a particular industry unless you produce those comparative reports. They were not produced by Labor in the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government; they are not being produced by this government. This is a government which said that they do not even need cost&hyphen;benefit analysis&mdash;the very thing that Mortimer says that you do need. We have to have comparative reports.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of sorrow that I find myself joining in this debate, because I think we are already seeing the results of the Industry Commission's report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These industries have seen the furore that the car industry and the car components industry had to undertake to pressure the government into rejecting a number of the very hard line, cold economic rationalist views of the Industry Commission in relation to the car industry. It was only after a lot of very heavy lobbying by very senior people, including senior supporters within the Liberal Party, that we saw that Industry Commission report not agreed to and a more sensible approach taken&mdash;the recognition that that is an important industry to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess the textile, clothing and footwear industries are saying, `Oh, dear, not again. Do we have to go through it?' This Industry Commission report is sending bad signals to the industry but what is sending even worse signals is the government's do nothing attitude. It is like everything else this government does&mdash;it does nothing. It just lets it slide along. They do not do anything to correct the mistruths and the misinformation that are appearing in the Asian press about one member for Oxley. The Prime Minister does nothing to dispel those sorts of inaccuracies or to rebut them. Again, you see this with the TCF industries report&mdash;nothing has been done to rebut it. It has been left to the industry to have to conduct a very serious and large campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of Berlei in Lithgow has been announced. What the people of Lithgow are very concerned about is that when 2,000 jobs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5967"> were lost in Newcastle as a result of the steel industry changes that BHP has made the federal government came forward with a rescue package, an assistance package, to the area. Lithgow council and a number of other organisations that they are linked with have been asking to be considered also for a rescue package. The loss of 184 jobs in a population area of less than 20,000 is of significant importance to this community; that is a significant number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the Textile Fashion Industry Association that research studies show that only one in five retrenched TCF workers gain employment in another industry within four years of losing a job and only 50 per cent find any work. Those figures are taken across the country and include capital city areas where the job opportunities for people are much more significant. When you come to rural and regional areas there are not a great deal of alternative job opportunities available. This government is not offering to do anything, to introduce any training programs or any rescue packages. It is of major concern. This shows a lack of concern and a lack of caring on the part of this government towards this industry, and it is an important industry to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's policy is very clear: freeze tariffs from 2000 to 2005 and, before you reintroduce any reductions after 2005, have a review to see what our competitors are doing. It is all very well for this government to want to go on hairy chested and say, `Yes, we'll keep reducing tariffs. It's important to keep reducing tariffs.' But, if the rest of the world is not keeping pace or not doing what they have made their agreements to do and showing no signs of undertaking agreements they might have already made under the World Trade Organisation and GATT agreements, we run the risk of being left out there like a lonely little shag on a rock seeing the demise of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government had an industry policy, the industry itself would be able to plan and know what its future was and have some idea of what the parameters are that it is working within. This government has no industry policy. This is another industry that is having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to battle hard to try to get the government to have some sort of an industry plan. As I have said, we have already seen the car industry have to do it. We are seeing the TCF industries having to do it. We are seeing the gold industry having to struggle and suffer because the government just decided to sell off a lot of our gold reserves and sent the wrong messages to those markets and to our goldmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TCF industries have been able to work with the careful and negotiated reductions in tariffs that have taken place. They knew what the conditions were up until 18 months ago, and they certainly knew up until the Industry Commission report. They had some idea of what the future planning was and of what the future regimes were. They were able to work within those parameters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to receive letters from people within the industry. I received a letter that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The decision to change tariffs before the industry can prepare for further reductions will cause companies like ours&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is a small to medium family owned enterprise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">to retract in volume and size, downsize and contribute to the already high unemployment and social problems. Our protection levels for this industry are lower than many of our trading partners, particularly in South&hyphen;East Asian markets, and a further reduction will increase the movement of more Australian firms offshore. The government preaches that small to medium family businesses are the backbone of Australia, but the changes to the TCF industry will only advance the entry of multinationals.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are very convinced that the government is not concerned at all about family businesses and family enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about TCF, I think it is important to recognise the importance of these to the rural and regional areas of Australia. In New South Wales, 1,000 people are employed in the industries. In regional New South Wales, over 7,500 people are employed in the TCF industries. In regional Victoria, it is 7,700 people. That is 15,000 people employed in these industries in regional New South Wales and Victoria. These regional areas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5968"> cannot afford to suffer these cuts to their job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very fortuitous that I have a copy of the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS>, the newspaper that is published in Bathurst. Bathurst also has a TCF industry in J. Robin and Sons shoes. I would like to quote from this article by Sheena Frost from page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS>. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shoe manufacturer J. Robin and Sons could take its operations off shore if the Federal Government does not freeze textile and footwear industry tariffs from 2000.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manager of the Bathurst factory which employs 40 people, Chris Penniceard, said the company&mdash;the largest Australian owned shoe manufacturer&mdash;is planning for the worst, following recommendations by the Industry Commission that tariffs be reduced to between zero and five per cent by 2010.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier on I said the Industry Commission report was sending the wrong messages and the government was doing nothing about it. Here we have a manager of one of J. Robin shoe manufacturing factories saying that they are working on the worst case scenario. They are working on that because they obviously cannot trust the government. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . there was no guarantee the company would stay in Australia if the government adopted this recommendation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bathurst factory injects $1.1 million into the local economy in wages alone, and produces around 200,000 pairs of shoes a year. It is the only one of four factories located outside a capital city.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So three other locations in this country are having similar sorts of injections of funds and finances into their economy because of the fact that Robins are there. He continues:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">However the temptation to move overseas will "be at its peak" by 2000 if the government does not freeze tariffs.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">But, obviously&mdash;to quote this particular gentleman who is in the industry&mdash;they cannot do it if the government goes ahead with the Industry Commission recommendations or if the Industry Commission does not alter its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is of major concern. As I said, this company injects a $1.1 million wage packet into the community each year. Forty jobs will be gone. Communities in rural and regional areas of Australia cannot stand those sorts of losses. What does that $1.1 million get spent on? It does not just go to those people; it gets spread around the community. It affects everybody in the community. If you take out an income level of $1.1 million, you must have an impact upon those regional and rural communities, but the government does not seem to understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also does not seem to understand that the industries have worked very well, as this gentleman has said, with the programs that have happened to date and can cope until the year 2000. But it is the year 2000, the year that the Industry Commission report recommendations start to take effect, that they have the problems with&mdash;the uncertainty, the rapid reduction in tariffs and things like that. It is of major concern, and it would well do these government members to think very clearly about this because they are important industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government had an industry policy, we would not need to debate here sector by sector each industry sector. They would actually be able to understand and know where they come from. But this is a government that has actually attacked the rural areas. We have seen Medicare offices under threat, and we have reversed that. In recent times we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5969"> have seen AQIS inspection charges for meat exports rise. We have seen people laid off by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had abattoirs say they cannot cope with anything up to a 300 per cent increase in inspection fees. We have seen losses of tax offices in country areas. We are seeing reductions in FIS officers to the Department of Social Security. We are seeing reductions in ABC services. We have seen all these sorts of things and now we run the risk of seeing losses in our textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This also goes in conjunction with the fact that the government have removed, destroyed, done away with, the department of regional development at a federal level. They say there is no constitutional need for them to be involved in this sort of endeavour. I would put it to the Senate that it is of vital importance that we have an understanding at a federal level and an international level of the importance of regional development to this country, of its significance and of the need for the federal government to maintain that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the groups that Berlei has given great praise to has been the New South Wales department of regional development. Why was the federal department not in there helping them as well? This textiles, clothing and footwear issue is very important. They are very important industries to this country&mdash;100,000 jobs. They cannot be sneezed at, cannot be dismissed and we cannot send the wrong signals to the industries. The industries have to have some certainty. While this government thrashes around uncertain as to what the future will be, it will be sending the wrong messages. It will not be encouraging investment in industries that are of vital importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By freezing the tariffs to the year 2005, the industries will have some certainty by their understanding that the review will be taking place in the year 2004. They will understand what they need to be looking for and what sorts of issues will be included in the review, and Senator Cook's motion certainly outlines three of the important points that should be taken into consideration when that review is

Senator Cook was, of course, then a minister in the previous government. He is the very man who is today trying to push the exact opposite with this motion&mdash;Labor's hypocritical U&hyphen;turn on industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In direct contrast to Senator Cook and his Labor Party colleagues, the government is mindful of the concerns of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Just yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assured workers in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries that the government has taken their concerns on board. He said only yesterday, referring to the Productivity Commission inquiry on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">When the Government receives the final report, it will take a speedy decision as it did with the motor manufacturing industry.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I regard the closure of factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the city of Lithgow but a tragedy for the region.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We ought to remember that Berlei's decision to move their manufacturing offshore, affecting over 200 jobs in Lithgow, was made under Labor's policy prescription.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook interjects that we are in government, but he does not tell the Senate that this tariff policy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5970"> was laid down by the previous government to go through to the year 2000. Just remember that, Senator Cook. This is a policy regime that was laid down by your government to the year 2000. It is under that policy that these closures are occurring, not under any policy of the present government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also ought to remember that DuPont accepted some $59 million as an up-front payment from the then Labor government's capitalisation grants program whereby DuPont agreed that it would buy and operate its Fibremakers synthetic fibre making business without tariff protection or bounties. The up-front payment was direct assistance provided instead of tariffs to help finance new investment to make the plant internationally competitive. It ran for five years plus two one&hyphen;year extensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DuPont's Chief Executive Officer, John Foote, admits that the `best endeavours' objective of the contract has not been met. So DuPont, like this opposition, is being quite disingenuous in blaming the current consideration of future tariff policy for the cutback in operations and consequent job losses in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What DuPont's decision does show is that massive subsidies given at the expense of others in the community do not protect jobs. The only way to protect jobs is to ensure that our industries achieve world best practice in their operations, become internationally competitive and adopt an aggressive export mentality. That is why, unlike Labor's knee&hyphen;jerk, U&hyphen;turn reaction to the industries' difficulties, which arose under the rules that were established by the previous Labor government, the Howard government will give careful consideration to all of the factors relevant to a decision on future protection arrangements for the industries and make a balanced decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let me make it plain once again, for Senator Cook's benefit.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COOK" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't bother.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not seem to understand. The industries, including DuPont, are currently operating under rules laid down by the previous Labor government. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are not operating under anyone else's rules; they are not operating under the Productivity Commission's interim report recommendations; they are not operating under Howard government initiated tariff structures. They are operating under Labor's continuing regime. The industries, and most importantly their employees, have nothing to fear from the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DuPont, a foreign company which has been given so much by the previous government, owes it to the Australian people and especially to its employees to wait for the government's decision on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, rather than rushing to close its Bayswater plant, using the current debate as an excuse. The Productivity Commission's final report on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries is due on 9 September. Then and only then will the government consider the final recommendations of that report before making a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, it is clear that Senator Cook in particular and the Labor Party in general have learnt nothing from being unceremoniously dumped by the people of Australia some 18 months ago. Does Labor seriously expect people to swallow more of its scare mongering through the lies being perpetrated on this issue? Senator Cook, Simon Crean and the rest of Labor are completely without credibility with regard to policy on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. They pursued one policy in government when they at least had some responsibility and accountability for their approach. Now, out of government and unlikely to return for many years, they take a purely populist approach, which is a complete U&hyphen;turn on their previous position when in government, safely knowing they will never have to implement it because the good sense of the Australian people will keep them out of office for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor failed Australia's textiles, clothing and footwear industries. They failed the industries' work force; they failed the industries' export objectives. In particular, that was evident when, between 1988 and 1994 under Labor, factory employment fell by 32 per cent; overall employment fell by 20 per cent; and, manufacturing output fell by 24 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5971"> per cent. Labor's policies failed because they did nothing to secure export markets for Australian firms. Between 1990 and 1996 the trade deficit in textiles, clothing and footwear goods increased by almost $400 million. Labor's policies failed because they did not prepare Australian industry for the challenges of the tariff reductions which they had initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of crocodile tears today can rewrite Labor's appalling record. Senator Cook's remarks on this issue are therefore completely without credibility. Nothing can reverse the fact that it is Labor Party policies which have overseen the tragic closures at Berlei and DuPont and countless other factories in earlier years. It was the Labor Party's neglect of important micro-economic reforms which contributed to the fall in competitiveness of Australian industry and which made it so extremely difficult for firms to compete in an environment of tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be absolutely no mistake on this issue: it was the Labor Party which was detrimental to these industries; it was the Labor Party which increased taxes; it was the Labor Party which introduced the unworkable Brereton unfair dismissal laws; it was the Labor Party which allowed business investment to decline to its lowest level on record; and, it was the Labor Party which failed to ensure that Australian companies had access to rapidly expanding Asian markets. It is the Labor Party which, as I have already said, is responsible for the textiles, clothing and footwear policies which are in place today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to that, the government will be taking into account the responsibilities which it has to everybody concerned with regard to this policy decision, including employees, and will be giving full consideration to the industries' submissions. The decision, which as I said will be taken after the final report of the Productivity Commission is presented to the government, will be fully consistent with our policy objectives, which are: first, to secure investment; secondly, to encourage exports; and, thirdly, to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Industry Commission&mdash;or the Productivity Commission, as it is now known&mdash;will be only one of the factors 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considered by the government before making its decision. We are committed to consulting widely with the industries and others involved in the future of the industries, including trade unions and state governments. The government regards the retention of strong and internationally competitive textiles, clothing and footwear industries as being extremely important. It is the government's intention to encourage the development and growth of these industries, unlike the failed policies of the Labor Party, which have seen these industries shrink and decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is committed to ensuring that policies are implemented which will ensure these industries can reach their full potential. We are also committed to ensuring that the industries are in a much more competitive position by the year 2010, when the APEC region moves to free trade, and to ensuring that the transition to 2010 is properly managed and does not place Australian companies at a disadvantage. That is a direct contrast with the way in which the Labor Party operated in government which, as I said before, was to put in place its tariff reduction strategy without in any way creating the overall economic environment whereby the industries could cope with those tariff reductions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook, I have already been through your complete policy failure in this regard&mdash;your failure to push ahead with micro&hyphen;economic reform, with labour market reform, and all of the related reforms which were absolutely essential if industries were to be capable of not just surviving but expanding under a regime of tariff reductions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also mindful that the industries will not benefit from uncertainty. That is why we will be allowing the industries to make their post year 2000 business and investment plans in a predictable policy context. Of course, this is in direct contrast to the opposition, which believes that the only way to gain credibility on this issue is to perform a backflip, to undertake a policy U&hyphen;turn, to which I referred earlier in my remarks. What they do not seem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5972"> to realise is that that absolutely destroys their credibility; it does not restore it. A U&hyphen;turn of that magnitude completely destroys their credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The textiles, clothing and footwear industries make an important contribution to the development of Australian manufacturing. They employ over 100,000 people, many of them in small to medium sized businesses, and some of those in regional locations. In 1996, these industries provided some nine per cent of manufacturing employment. The industries have a significant impact on the Australian economy. In 1994&hyphen;95, the textiles, clothing and footwear manufacturing turnover exceeded some $9.5 billion, representing five per cent of manufacturing gross domestic product. The industries are also major exporters. In 1995&hyphen;96, they exported $2.7 billion worth of goods, which is greater than the exports of the automotive industry at $2.2 billion, and the computers and office machinery industry at $1.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that the Howard government has put in place a comprehensive process to review the post year 2000 arrangements for the textiles, clothing and  footwear industries. The opposition fear campaign is nothing more than a cheap attempt to divert attention away from their own policy failures during 13 years of government. This motion put forward as a general business notice of motion today by Senator Cook and his colleagues simply reinforces the fact that they are engaged in a scaremongering exercise and a further attempt to divert attention away from their own failed policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the motion in relation to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The TCF crisis is certainly important, but it is not a new problem. I have highlighted the situation during virtually the whole of my term. For a more detailed consideration of the issue I would like to commend the work of Elizabeth Peak, who worked for me as a parliamentary intern in 1994. She produced a very good report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The ignorance of implications: policy making 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries</EMPHASIS> . It was done in my office for the work that I was doing in the Senate, and it was tabled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say that it is very useful to look back now at the issues that were identified at that time. They included the fact that, during the time that former Senator Button was working with the car industry, he was also working with the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, but his way of operation with both those industries was different. It is hard to understand exactly why, considering the numbers of jobs involved and the importance of the industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chapman has pointed out how important the industries are in many ways employment&hyphen;wise and in terms of the actual level of the economy. But they are also obviously very important in terms of the fact that one would think it would be good for a country like Australia to be able to produce its basic food, clothing and shelter; not an unreasonable assumption, considering the distances involved between us and the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the days when Senator Button was working with industry to reduce tariffs, agreements were reached between government and the car industry on tariff reductions. There were also protracted agreements between the government and the textile, clothing and footwear industries. But there was a difference: the difference was that although the government respected the agreement between itself and the car industry, not once but twice they totally ignored the outcome of those protracted discussions and recommendations from the IAC and reduced the tariffs further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original agreement was to have an in&hyphen;built system to assess whether or not the policies were meeting their goals. You would think that was a reasonable thing to do. If what we are trying to do is bring about a certain level of efficiency in such a way as not to damage the industry too much at one time, we would have a method of looking back to see if we were achieving those goals. But, as I say, not once but twice this agreement was reneged on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point when I came into the parliament. Honourable senators who were here at the time may remember that I asked a number of questions of Senator Cook, who was then Minister for Trade. The questions related to the level of tariff reductions, whether or not the government was cognisant of their impact, and their relationship to Australia's signing of the Uruguay Round of GATT. If anybody remembers, at the time Senator Cook clearly denied that the reductions were anything to do with the Uruguay Round of GATT and that the subsequent major job losses in the industry had anything to do with the Uruguay Round of GATT because, as he pointed out, they were voluntary; they were as a result of a policy decision by this government, taken before anything was required under the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somebody might say that this could have been considered to be a naive approach. In hindsight, of course, it was a naive approach. In the rest of the world, along with the negotiations for the Uruguay Round of GATT&mdash;which, of course, is now the World Trade Organisation&mdash;there were many great words. But they have at least left themselves the leeway since the signing and the implementation of the Uruguay Round of GATT to make the adjustments which were then required under the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia did not do that. We actually pushed the textile, clothing and footwear industries in particular further than they were initially happy and comfortable to go. We left them in a situation where, under the Uruguay Round of GATT and the World Trade Organisation, they were required to go further. We are getting bleats from other parts of the world&mdash;where tariffs levels are greater than ours&mdash;saying that we should be doing more to reduce our current levels. That was not particularly bright of Australia at the time. The question remains: why were the textile, clothing and footwear industries treated so differently from the way the car industry was treated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the answer, if I was cynical, relates to the current treatment of the textile, clothing and footwear industries by some sections of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the media. I noticed the other day that one report of the closure of the Berlei factory talked about 200 pay packets, not 200 jobs&mdash;not the human impact of people losing their jobs, but 200 pay packets. Women are still not real people out there in the world of jobs. I think that has something to do with the fact that the industries have been treated differently over time from the way the car industry, the mining industry and other industries have been treated when job questions were considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The textile, clothing and footwear industries are generally industries where, in developing countries, worker exploitation is particularly rife. Cases such as a fire in an overcrowded Thai factory without proper fire escapes, or building collapses are not uncommon. There have been cases where women and children could not get out of the factories; they were virtually entombed in those factories. Use of bonded and child labour and wage levels well below minimum wages, even where minimum wages are $1 a day, are also strongly present in foreign textile, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children and women are frequently favoured for such work because of high manual dexterity and delicacy, and good eyesight. Under typical factory conditions of long hours, poor lighting and bad diet, eyesight goes quickly. Stories appear regularly of scams where poor, isolated women workers or young children are lured with promises of jobs&mdash;so they come from rural areas and then obviously become very dependent&mdash;only to find themselves imprisoned in factories and made to work without pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to compete with massive exploitation has led less scrupulous manufacturers here to institute as much exploitation as the labour market will bear. Exploitative work practices include: piecework production, requiring workers to have their own equipment and work from home; and common use of migrant and marginalised group labour at less than the effective minimum wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people would choose to work at home; other people find that the exploitation of the piecework makes it worse than working in a factory because it is harder for anybody 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5974"> to check that, whether they are unions or other industry inspectors. There, they are often paid by the hour or by the piece, so in fact the exploitation is set by the piece rate rather than by anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Levels of tariffs and other industry protection and promotion moves are common overseas. Most nations recognise that clothing is a necessity which will be imported on a massive scale if domestic industry is not healthy. If you look, for instance, at the trade figures between Australia and China, you will find that, about a year ago, they were worth roughly $3 billion each. The difference is that Australia is producing massive amounts of lower value, high volume goods and Australia is importing mainly fairly high value added goods, such as footwear, clothing and textiles, tools and other manufactured goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, various competitive pressures result in even more drastic exploitation as nations like Thailand use even cheaper Vietnamese labour and re&hyphen;label goods as `Thai' to circumvent trade barriers. At the same time, low Vietnamese labour costs were used to suppress an increased minimum wage push by Thai workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beneficiaries of this push are rarely workers, or even manufacturers. Distributors and large retailers decide what goods to import and do so en masse. Their decisions are based on which products are least expensive. Retail price, or prices to small domestic retailers, are established on the basis of profit maximisation. A result is that lower manufacturing costs through lower wages do not necessarily translate into lower retail price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an assumption that the international free market would bring a lot of such benefits to the consumer, but we need to look seriously at what exactly were the benefits to consumers in Australia. As I said, retail price, or prices to small domestic retailers, are established on the basis of profit maximisation. A result is that lower manufacturing costs through lower wages do not necessarily translate into lower retail price. They do not benefit either workers or consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is most apparent in things like designer running shoes&mdash;Nike and so on. Though the cost dropped to a small fraction of what it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might have been&mdash;it might cost $1 to produce them&mdash;when manufacture shifted from the US to Indonesia and other low wage countries, the prices of such goods did not come down markedly. Nike and similar type shoes are still expensive. So the distribution is where the money is made. Therefore, we cannot say that there are benefits passed on either to the workers, necessarily, or to the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another result has been that diversity has often decreased. Think about it: globally, there are few very inexpensive sources. All importers know who they are and that the best profit margin is likely to be on these goods. As a consequence, such goods proliferate and drive the vast diversity of goods manufactured by national, regional and local small and medium scale producers out of the market. Not entirely out of the market&mdash;some small businesses may stock them. But large distributors, department stores and retail chains will generally have what is effectively a very similar small range of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, because they are being pushed to be internationally competitive or even locally competitive, they only stock those goods which they think they will move most quickly. So the range of goods, for a number of reasons, as part of our jump into free trade, has reduced, in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if all tariff barriers were gone, we have a situation of disequilibrium between the mobility of capital and the mobility of labour. So the advantage for the owners of capital is that they can move from place to place. They can raffle down, bid down, the prices for labour from one country to another, just as they bid down the environmental conditions from place to place. Wages and conditions are being raffled down to the lowest common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The translation of that is that capital can invest wherever it makes the most money, but workers are less able to go where they make the most money. This means that human beings have needs but there is no reason for anyone to employ them, unless more money can be made by employing someone else. So they are more vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some sort of fantasy that if TCF jobs go, it will create a vacuum that will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5975"> filled by very high value intellectual and other service work. This has not worked. The evidence is that skilled manufacturing workers, when made redundant, move down the ladder of skills. They do work with less value added. Not only that, imports of value added goods increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that not everyone is intellectually or emotionally suited to be a manager, a researcher, a computer programmer or a provider of legal and financial services. Sacking people will not improve their prospects. On the other hand, a portion of people will be suited to manufacturing work. They will like it and will be extremely good at it. If employment is any kind of objective, it is important to provide a diversity of work since there a diversity of people. If we concentrate only on those industries where we believe we have a competitive advantage we are actually doing ourselves a disservice in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We continue to function in a very unequal situation. Other nations have both high tariffs and strong policies to retain a diversity of work, particularly in the production of high volume consumables. They also foster high value added work. Is it not ironic that Australia believed that we should be naive enough to reduce tariffs much more than was required in certain industries like the TCF industries on the basis that the rest of the world would follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same thinking says that we cannot take the lead and do the right thing to protect the environment through greenhouse gas reductions because we have to wait until everybody else does the right thing and we are not sure whether or not it is going to be a problem for the coal industry. Is it not ironic that in one area, the footwear, clothing and textiles industries, we can leap in with both feet naively and yet we sit with our hands behind our backs when we need to take the lead in relation to reducing greenhouse gas and creating employment through new opportunities in the energy efficiency and conservation areas. It is funny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China produces computers, computer components, TVs and various electronic audio equipment. It has no lack of capacity for the things we say we want to move towards to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> replace the things they now do for us. Failure to do this will virtually ensure a negative balance of trade. They also maintain a large number of direct subsidies such that clothing from China is essentially produced below cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have swallowed intellectual poison by accepting a purist version of free trade. Other nations argue such a line, but they do so when it is to their advantage. Their practice might be quite different. The United States is quite happy to bully Japan and to establish bilateral controlled trade agreements. The US and the European Union are very happy to use subsidies to act against our wheat and beef markets. Their rhetoric on free trade is usually impeccable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have award winning textiles, clothing and footwear industries. They need to be supported and fostered, not simply allowed to die in the interest of a counterproductive ideology. We have the capacity to build such an industry with far less in the way of trade barriers and subsidies than other nations have in place. We could improve our industry assistance and still be world leaders in deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, there may be a case for genuinely free trade, but before that occurs I think there is a strong case for a managed trade regime. I would also say that free trade requires a strong universal international regulatory regime. There is not one now. What we have is a very undemocratic structure. The World Trade Organisation is run by corporations, and that is not the same as free trade. In the meantime, there is considerable scope to develop a strong, flexible industry policy in which the promotion of import replacement for major consumables and industry diversity have a central place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of positive environmental and social implications of such a regime. Firstly, it would vastly decrease transport, dependency on exports and vulnerability to the global financial markets. It is truly a shame that in 1997 we have ships or even plane loads of the same goods going in different directions. That is not very bright. Secondly, it would also allow sustainable management policies to be more effectively 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5976"> put into place. Thirdly, it would provide a diverse job base. This is important in developing a robust economy. Without a strong set of manufacturing skills we lose the capacity to develop much in the way of closely or serendipitously associated industries. For example, skilled textile workers may shift to something like costuming for our film support industry. Many spin-off possibilities, such as high employment and high value added small businesses, result from having a healthy manufacturing sector such as the textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely pleased&mdash;no matter whether it was brought forward by Senator Cook or someone else, although the irony is amazing&mdash;that we are having this debate. I am very pleased that it is not just the Greens and the Democrats bringing this debate to the Senate this time. I am very pleased that we are beginning to talk about jobs in a real way and beginning to talk about the need for industry policy and the future for these very important industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This involves real people. Not only are they in a very important employment sector; they are in a very important strategic sector. The people who produce goods and services in Australia are also the people who buy goods and services in Australia. They deserve support. They are not just wage packets; they are real people. They are part of regional Australia. They are part of urban Australia. It is time we started looking, in a more holistic way, to our future in urban and regional Australia, to produce a smarter Australia. I think there is still time for us to get that right.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> confident that the case for the opposition has been made thus far, and it is a most unconvincing case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the Senate has a certain hollowness about it because only yesterday we were discussing an urgency motion brought to us by that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Weekly</EMPHASIS> senator, Senator Stott Despoja. There was a much quoted Attorney&hyphen;General's discussion paper and it was said that the government should pick up the recommendations in that paper. Today we have the debate that the government should not pick up the recommendations of the Industry Commission report. That is the hollowness of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reports or discussion papers are no more than that; that is their status and that is where they stand. The government takes their recommendations into consideration, but the cabinet makes the final decision. The government makes the decision. So do not elevate these reports, whether they are Industry Commission reports or discussion papers from departments, to give them any more importance than they deserve. That is the hollowness of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook comes in here with his motion urging us to reject the Industry Commission final report on the TCF industries, which is yet to even come down. You can see the political capital that he is trying to make, as he did with the car industry issue. He got a real shock when the government came down with the decision to freeze tariffs. I did not hear one speaker from the other side commend the government on its decision in regard to the car industry. We froze tariffs from the year 2000 to 2004.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the culture and thinking within the government at the moment. You would not think, listening to the previous speakers, that this government had made a decision to freeze tariffs in the car industry, yet it was the previous government that accelerated the reduction in tariffs. Quite frankly, they come to this debate with absolutely no credibility at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that I happen to have, by coincidence only, the same quotes that my colleagues have used previously in relation to Senator Cook's credibility on industry policy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5977"> and his calling for a freeze in tariffs. So allow me to quote Senator Cook, as my colleagues have. On 6 June, 1994 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was said that if tariff reform was attempted in these areas (transport sector, including manufactures of motor vehicles) both sectors would be killed off entirely. Well, they have not been; they are flourishing . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Only a day later he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we had left the tariff wall intact the old poor quality, high&hyphen;priced inefficient Australian vehicle would have been overwhelmed and we would have no car industry now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point there is that Senator Cook, in those days, had all the zeal of Roger Douglas. He had more zeal in his ministry than did the former Treasurer of New Zealand, Roger Douglas&mdash;and he is infamous for the zeal that he brought to New Zealand with his economic rationalism. In those days, Senator Cook was no different. He held the levers; he was the minister. He had all the information before him, yet he spoke with great zeal of reducing tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now Senator Cook comes in&mdash;and what a difference opposition makes&mdash;and calls for tariff freezes. He does not come to this debate with any credibility at all; in fact, he comes to this debate with opportunism and all the cynicism he can muster. He is not alone. The truth is that the Labor opposition are the tariff cutters. The member for Hotham, Mr Crean, gives weight to this claim. Mr Crean, a senior member of the opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one understands better than Labor that the tariff war has been fought and won. After all it was Labor that fought and won it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A better quote than that comes from 19 May 1990, when the member for Hotham said that the only people who have adjusted tariff levels have been members of the Labor government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975 and this Government are the only ones who have reduced tariffs. There was a 25 per cent cut under the Whitlam Government and there was a 35 per cent cut under this Government. Where was the cut from the opposition side?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that was when we were in opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not one cut in tariff at any stage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now they are calling for tariff freezes. Lindsay Tanner, another very prominent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member within the Labor opposition, has warned his party not to go too far in these tariff cuts. This is the inconsistency within the opposition at the moment. Lindsay Tanner has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a danger that Labor will allow tariffs to resume the unduly policy in the past. We cannot afford a return to the 1970's.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is a man who does not want tariff cuts&mdash;more like tariff acceleration. He just happens to be in the same faction as the next speaker, Senator Carr, so I will be interested to see where Senator Carr stands on accelerated tariff cuts. Will he be like the member for Melbourne, factional member, or will he be like Senator Cook in regard to tariff freezes? So the opposition has no credibility in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I interjected on Senator West, but she did not take up the interjection, so allow me to make my point now. The Labor Party introduced in 1989 the TCF tariff reductions, but in 1991&mdash;and we should remember the state of the economy in 1991; it was a time of deep recession, high interest rates and high unemployment&mdash;they decided to accelerate the TCF tariff reductions that they had put in place in 1989. They could not have picked a worse time to change their policy midstream. That did more damage to the TCF industries&mdash;and we are probably still seeing the effects&mdash;than anything else that they could have done. That is the inconsistency that we have in the opposition's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard also the false accusations today in regard to blaming this government, which has been in office less than 18 months, for the factory closures of DuPont, Berlei and Gloweave which have taken their business overseas. Far from it being this government's policy, it probably had more to do with the previous government's tariff regime which they accelerated in 1991, in the midst of a recession. So let us not forget the 1980s and the 1990s, the atmosphere and the economy that the TCF industries had to work under, with at the same time a reduced tariff regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government intends to react to the Industry Commission's final report on the TCF industries in the same way as it did with the Industry Commission report on the car 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5978"> industry. In that particular industry we recognised that the Industry Commission's report was but one source to cabinet. We would rely on many different sources. You will recall that we undertook very extensive industry consultations and party room debate. Moreover, the government did not keep the car industry waiting for its judgment long after the final Industry Commission report. It followed up very quickly&mdash;in less than a week. I outline this procedure because we will follow the same procedure in relation to the TCF industries once the Industry Commission's report is handed down. They can rest assured that we know the debate quite well. Our record, our form, can be seen in relation to the car industry and, more than that, we will give a speedy reply to the report. In fact, like my colleagues, I wish to quote the Prime Minister yesterday&mdash;27 August&mdash;when he assured the workers of the TCF industries that the government had taken all their concerns into consideration. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the government receives the final report, it will take a speedy decision, as it did with the motor manufacturing industry. And in taking the decision, it will certainly pay very strong regard to the interests of the employees in that industry. I regard the closure of the factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the employees, a tragedy for the City of Lithgow, but a tragedy for the region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That should be a fair and proper signal to the opposition and to the industry of the government's thinking in relation to TCF industries. Our decision within the car industry, as I said, to freeze tariffs&mdash;I have not heard one speaker from the other side give credit to this decision, but we have decided to freeze tariffs in the car industry until the year 2004&mdash;is a very pragmatic and sensible outcome for that industry. In framing that post&hyphen;2000 structure decision, the government sought to balance two fundamental objectives. We had to ensure that we were acting, firstly, to meet our international trade obligations and, secondly, to provide the right environment to secure the next round of investments within the car industry, therefore stimulating employment within the industry. The extent to which we have achieved that balance was illustrated only recently with the Toyota decision to make further investments in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Altona plant with some expected 200 new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point here is that the government is aware, better than the opposition, of the environment needed to create investment and employment in these very vulnerable industries&mdash;vulnerable to international competition. As we acted in the car industry, rest assured that a similar understanding will be given to TCF industries. It is worth mentioning that, in creating a very sound business environment for TCF industries, it just does not stop with the tariff issue. The government has supported the industry by bringing about a lower Australian dollar through a very sound fiscal management. One of the virtues of a balanced budget has been a lower dollar, putting our TCF industries on a far more competitive footing in regard to exports and, for that matter, import competition. Yet at every turn the opposition attempted to frustrate the government's budgetary process, being ignorantly unaware or just simply not caring how a balanced budget will benefit TCF industries in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was left a $10.3 billion budget deficit and $100 billion government debt by the previous government, in tandem with severe tariff cuts, and that had more to do with the root cause of unemployment in this industry and the closure of factories than anything else. As a senator for Victoria I am only too aware of the importance the manufacturing industry has in my state and, as has been mentioned in this debate, within the regional areas. I am sure we have all received the very fine Council of Textile Fashion Industries of Australia submission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pause for a cause: TCF 2000 and beyond</EMPHASIS>. That report is full of information on the TCF industries and quotes that they employ some 96,000 to 100,000 Australians, of which 8.5 per cent are within the regional areas of Australia, which is the area I am most concerned with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, the state which employs the largest number in TCF industries, there are some 49,600 people employed in TCF industries. In the regional areas, in Barwon&hyphen;Western district there are 1,900 employed, Central Highlands&hyphen;Wimmera area some 900 em 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5979"> ployed, Loddon&hyphen;Campaspe&hyphen;Mallee area 300 employed and in the Goulburn&hyphen;Ovens&hyphen;Murray area 3,200 people employed. So we are only too aware of the importance that these industries have for the towns and for employment where these people reside, and the knock&hyphen;on effect within those towns. In the town of Wangaratta alone there are three very important TCF industries. There is Bruck Textiles Pty Ltd factory, the Australian Country Spinners factory which was once better known as the Wangaratta Woollen Mills, and of course the well&hyphen;known trademark of Yakka also resides in Wangaratta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are only too aware of the employment benefits that these industries bring to the local area. We are not going to leave them to hang out to dry like the previous government did, crushing them with higher interest rates, debt burdens and ever accelerating tariff reductions. We are not going to change midstream from the 1989 policy to the 1991 policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to take into account the employment factors, the future investment factors and our trade obligations. We will come down with a decision not rushed by the opposition's motions. We are not spooked by this particular motion or, least of all, spooked by Senator Cook, the former minister, who had his opportunity to bring some benefits to this industry. We are not spooked at all. We will make a very swift decision within the month of September in regard to this industry once the IC report is handed down.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes initially in this debate to outline the importance of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries to my state of Tasmania. The industries there employ approximately 1,500 people and generate over $140 million in sales turnover annually. They provide significant value adding. This value adding is particularly important to agricultural products, including wool and hides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take a few moments to look at the importance and the structure of a number of these firms in Tasmania. We can look at Australian Weaving Mills, and I suppose no firm has been restructured more than Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ian Weaving Mills. It has a work force which has been reduced to 300 people. It is a major contributor to the Devonport economy. It has an annual turnover of $36 million, of which $21 million flows into the local economy. The loss of such an enterprise as this would be devastating to a city the size of Devonport, because it deals with over 100 companies in a significant way&mdash;most of which are located along the north-west coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same town, we have Tascot Templeton, which employs approximately 205 people at its east Devonport factory and a further 20 people in mainland offices. Like in so many textile mills, 54 per cent of the Devonport employees are female; 48 per cent are aged under 30; and 44 per cent have more than five years with the company. So any significant reduction that the draft report would suggest would have a devastating impact. This company spends $8.5 million in Tasmania annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the effect of the Industry Commission's recommendations if tariffs on carpets were reduced? May I remind you that they actually have been reduced from 35 per cent to the current 21 per cent. During that time, carpet imports have increased by 52 per cent, and the number of jobs in that industry have fallen by about 20 per cent. The number of firms in that industry has roughly halved. If the recommendations of the Industry Commission's report were adopted and tariffs were further reduced from 15 per cent in the year 2000 to five per cent in the year 2005, Tascot Templeton estimate a reduction of approximately a third of their work force and minimal future investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can then go to the opposite end of the island, to Blundstone footwear. They employ 320, and the company's future directly affects another 28 people employed at a local tannery&mdash;value adding. Blundstone consists of a highly integrated group of companies; that is, a tannery and two modern footwear factories owned and operated by a family whose continuous involvement in the manufacture of footwear spans 140 years. The company is highly specialised and is Australia's largest manufacturer of heavy duty work and protec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5980"> tive safety footwear, servicing markets in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the last decade has seen continuing heavy investment in new technologies and plant and unprecedented growth in production and sales. The modern footwear factory has the latest technology which ensures flexibility, high quality and efficient productivity. Blundstone maintains a strong and comprehensive program of apprenticeships and cadetships to develop its work force. In fact, this company's achievements were recognised with an Australian Export Award in 1996. Blundstone will continue to invest in new equipment and technology and become more competitive, but that relies on Australia's trading partners falling into line and all participants competing on a level playing field. They have indicated that part of their operation may be forced offshore if the recommendations of the draft report are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that no other country put its textiles, clothing and footwear industries under the sort of pressure that the Labor Party put Australia's industries under. Slow reductions are easier for the industry to cope with. With some slow adjustments, natural attrition can be relied upon to reduce some of the work force. But, with rapid adjustment, employers could be forced to retrench employees or close their doors. We have already seen some of that because of the fear of the Industry Commission's attitude towards textiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what is important in Tasmania&mdash;and this is generally true on the mainland&mdash;is that a large percentage of their work force are young and female. Should these people lose their jobs, they are not readily able to pack their families up and go to Melbourne or to another centre. Many of these people have husbands who work in other industries. Tasmania has the highest unemployment rate in Australia, and jobs are scarce for the unskilled. So it is rather difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to the Senate that most of the large gains to be expected from reducing tariffs further and at such speed have already been achieved. Australian manufacturers have been forced to improve quality and upgrade 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technology, and Australia's purchasers of TCF products are very much closer to world prices now than they were a decade ago, so gains to consumers in the future will be much more modest, but lower protection in the future will generate large job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate that the Australian textiles, clothing and footwear industries should not be expected to operate unprotected while transport, waterfront and communications industries, to name but a few, are reforming very slowly. If the TCF industries in Australia are to be internationally competitive, these other issues must also be addressed, and addressed at perhaps the same speed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very few companies would be in a position to achieve 10 to 20 per cent productivity increases in a year or two, and yet this is exactly what a sudden reduction in protection would require companies to achieve in order to survive. I remind the Senate that once an industry and factories are wiped out, it is almost impossible to re&hyphen;establish them. Time must be allowed for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries to adjust; otherwise increasing competition from imports will continue to cause them to contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission's findings fly in the face of the Mortimer recommendations. Mortimer says, `Go for growth and the role of the business programs in investment, innovation and export.' The Mortimer report provides a framework for the government to achieve a goal which all Australians can share in. There must be a level playing field. This is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a problem. The Industry Commission should pause further tariff reductions after the year 2000 at their 2000 levels until at least the year 2005, when there should be a re&hyphen;examination of the progress that has been made. I believe that many of the conclusions that have been arrived at by the Industry Commission were very subjective indeed. Only a small change in some of those matters which it relied upon could have a large impact in terms of output. At a national level, it is predicted that the investment between 2000 and 2005 could drop from a projected $84 million to $9 million if the IC's recommendations were to be adopted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5981">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another quick word on the assumptions on which the IC's calculations were made: they were very subjective and not scientific. Small variations in these assumptions could actually change the cost to Australian consumers from the IC quoted figure of $20,000 per employee to just $2,540 per employee. The other thing is that we must take into account the social, unemployment and underemployment costs arising from the IC's recommendations. It must have a wider concern across the whole community, taking into account other than just economic factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is disappointing is the crocodile tears which are now coming from the Australian Labor Party, because these come in respect of an industry which that party has done so much in the last 25 years to destroy. I admit much of what Senator Cook had to say; however, the textiles, clothing and footwear industries are not well set up to be the vanguard of world trade reforms. The difficulties so many businesses find themselves in today are the result of the policies imposed on them by the previous Labor government, in which Senator Cook was a major player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until very recently, Senator Cook was a prime advocate of continuing tariff reductions and the internationalisation of the economy, including the textile industry. While I welcome his change of heart, one must at the same time consider it hypocritical, particularly as thousands of people have lost their jobs as a result of those policies. Naturally, he was formerly committed to tariff reductions. Senator Cook and his colleagues are now trying to commit to a caring attitude towards those workers. I acknowledge that caring attitude, but where was that caring attitude 13 years previously&mdash;or even in the last 25 years&mdash;because between 1988 and 1994&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government, the coalition government, now has the task of providing for a caring, pragmatic policy for these industries which will guide them through the necessary changes over the next decade without sacrificing them to join the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people who became permanent fixtures in this country through 13 years of Labor government&mdash;and many more as a result of the policies of the earlier Whitlam government. As I said earlier, it is an important industry for Tasmania. Those people need respect from government. They expect to operate and to live in a dignified way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I naturally have a serious personal interest in this matter&mdash;and I suppose I must declare an interest&mdash;being a former employee within the textile industry. But these industries must be given a fair chance to survive, to prosper and to profit from the restructuring that has taken place. The result will then be that these people can work and continue to find satisfying employment and security well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I continue to have very vivid memories of the catastrophic results in my home city of Launceston, which suffered from the overnight reduction of the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cuts and revaluations of the dollar which cut a swathe through employment in Australia, and particularly in my city of Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the textile industry still survives. It deserves to survive. It has undergone many, many changes, with improved efficiencies. In fact, if you look at many of the efficiencies in textiles, they rank pretty high by world standards. And when you start comparing our performance with Asian performances per employee, Australian efficiencies rank well, even with the so-called lower paid Asian populations employed in textiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has nothing to gain and plenty to lose by being in the vanguard of further tariff reforms, so a pause is necessary. I believe our government will deliver a pragmatic outcome, somewhat similar to that achieved in the motor car industry where the motor car industry can now see a future. That was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5982"> certainly good news for Launceston, where the very efficient, export orientated ACL Bearing Company is actually putting on extra staff as a result of that decision, and the motor car industry generally has re&hyphen;invested. We have seen a good result from Toyota, which would never have been possible without a pragmatic decision by the Liberal&hyphen;National Party coalition in relation to the motor car industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must carefully monitor the reforms of our major competitors or we are seriously at risk of simply exporting the jobs of Australian workers. We have done that too often in the past and that must not be allowed to continue. So we must have a slow progress towards lower tariffs. At the same time, we must have a close monitoring of the ongoing effects which will permit the industry to adapt and plan for its future. As I mentioned earlier, many of the large gains possible through restructuring and reform have already been achieved. How much more are you going to expect from Australian woollen mills in terms of their restructuring, change of ownership, change of location and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australian businesses have now greatly improved technology and productivity, compared with some decades ago. There would be very few industries which could achieve this 10 to 20 per cent extra productivity over the period of a year or two at this stage. As a result, I believe that the industry should receive a pragmatic treatment, and it deserves such. It has done a lot to cope with the change, to keep alive, to keep going and to keep people employed. But unlike the opposition, who think they can gain short-term credibility from performing backflips, our government will provide a program on which the TCF sector can draw confidence into the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be part of this debate and, in particular, to be able to follow on from the comments made by Senator John Watson, because he, I dare say of anybody in this chamber, is acutely aware of the problems that have arisen in the past in relation to this industry, such as when tariffs were dealt with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the way they were under the previous Whitlam government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australians will recall what happened during the Gough Whitlam era in relation to the reduction of tariffs. If you want to know why the electorate of Bass fell at the 1975 by&hyphen;election and then was retained as a Liberal seat for so long, it was a result of the Labor Party's dealing with tariffs, because it was felt very, very severely by the people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems somewhat strange that the Labor Party should therefore come into this chamber with that sort of record and move a motion of this nature. What we need to do is remember what certain people in the past, such as Mr Crean, have told us. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one understands better than Labor that the tariff war has been fought and won. After all, it was Labor that fought and won it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the Labor Party in the past have tried to claim credit for changes in relation to tariffs. We were told also by Mr Crean that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is not proposing to restore the high tariff barriers of the past or keep them in existing levels indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor Party pursued a policy which was clearly a policy of reducing tariffs. Part and parcel of that was the deal that they did with the DuPont factory, which in recent times has closed down. Senators might recall that $60 million of taxpayers' funds were introduced into that factory to save 160 jobs and, because they did not stitch the deal up properly, the factory closed anyway. If you have a look at that for a job subsidy, it really is a very high level of subsidisation. The motion before us, as I have indicated, really is one that highlights the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party when it is put into the context of the way that Labor have dealt with this issue in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to set the record straight: everybody is talking about the recommendations of a commission which is a report to government, not of government. The final report is due out on 9 September. The government will then consider that final report and make a decision. The government has made no decision whatsoever at this stage. Any factories that are closing down, such as Berlei 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5983"> or DuPont, are closing down as a result of Labor policies that are still in force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a government, have studied the Industry Commission draft report very carefully. We will also study their final report very carefully. But then we, as the government, will make the final decision for the benefit of all Australians, and that is something that has to be recognised and remembered. There are certain elements within the community that are seeking to suggest that the draft report, which is the topic of discussion these days, is in fact a government decision. It is not a government decision and it is a decision that we will consider in detail and determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the people of Australia can feel confident that we will deal with this issue in a mature and considered manner. After all, there were similar recommendations from this commission in relation to the car industry. We, as a government, did not fully embrace those recommendations. We looked at them and factored them in with the socioeconomic factors as well and made a decision which will see a reduction in tariffs. We also ensured ongoing investment in the vital car industry to the extent that Toyota has announced a $1 billion plant and investment. They are the sorts of decisions this government makes. Sure, it gets reports to advise itself but then it factors in the socioeconomic matters as well to ensure that a good outcome is arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought be remembered that tariffs per se are not necessarily good economically. What you have to remember is that ultimately a tariff is a tax. Every product that is protected by tariffs within this country means that the consumer, the Australian public, has to pay more for that particular item. Therefore, you are making the consumers, our fellow Australians, buy product for higher prices. As a result, it is quite a sensible and responsible economic policy to pursue to try to seek a reduction in those tariffs no matter in what industry they might apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, you have to do it in a sensible way so that industry can adjust&mdash;readjust its work force and its investments and ensure that it is able to meet the competitive factors of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overseas imports once those tariffs are reduced. It is therefore appropriate, in my submission, that we reduce tariffs, not overnight, as the previous Whitlam government did, but wean industry off tariffs slowly but surely so that ultimately the Australian people can benefit with lower priced items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should remember that these tariffs do impact on our exporting capacities and capabilities. For example, the tariff on the car industry adds to the costs of a motor vehicle in this country. Therefore, every business that uses a motor vehicle in this country for the purposes of production for export has to factor that extra increased price into its cost when it seeks to export its product overseas. Therefore, by that extent, the product that they manufacture is so much less competitive than it otherwise would be. They are some of the factors that need to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in recent times that there have been newly formed political parties suggesting we ought to have tariffs in relation to virtually everything and nothing to protect Australian industry. Just keep in mind that if we were to go down that path it would in fact be a tax on every single Australian citizen who had to buy those products at inflated prices. Remember that if the people of Australia can buy those products at a cheaper price they would therefore have more money left over in their pocket to be able to spend on other domestic items, so that money would not simply be lost to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In typical style, I note that there is an amendment from our friends the Australian Democrats suggesting that there should be a freeze on TCF tariff reductions effective immediately.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray says, `You agree of course.' I have to say to you, Senator Murray, you are jumping the gun. All you are doing is responding to a draft report. It may well be that the commission makes that very recommendation to us as a government, but we do not know because they have not reported yet. The final report still has not come down, but Senator Murray can second guess the commission. He knows better and he is going to determine that that ought be the

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not say so in the motion, Senator Murray. That is one of the dangerous things with the Democrats: they will put one thing in a motion and say something different in their supporting speech. That is why you can never actually pin them down on anything, and they are a moving feast when it comes to policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ill behoves this parliament to try to second guess the final report. I think it is appropriate that the government be given sufficient time to consider that report and to come down with a considered opinion and policy response to that report. With respect to the amendment of the Australian Democrats, it really is jumping the gun and not wanting to hear all the evidence that might be available. I would hope and trust that the Australian Democrats will still have a sufficiently open mind that they are able to listen and consider the Industry Commission's final report and develop a response to that rather than closing off all options as they seem to want to do in their amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Democrat amendment is in the same vein as the comments made by the shadow industry minister, Mr Crean, who has sought to be critical of the government for, to use his words, `letting the thing drift; they failed to follow up and get commitments from the companies' then demanding that the government force DuPont to honour its commitments. How can we let the thing drift when the final report isn't even down yet? It really is a ludicrous suggestion to say, when you commission somebody and they put down a draft report, `We won't wait for their final report. We ought to come down with our policy decision before that commission has had the opportunity to factor in all of the community response.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that he made those comments in relation to DuPont which, in fact, is a classic example of what happens when you simply try to subsidise an industry such as DuPont and they close down anyway after $60 million worth of taxpayers' money for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 160 jobs. If you divide that $60 million by 160 jobs, it is an interesting exercise. How much subsidy per job is that? Have you ever stopped to think about that, Senator Murray? If you have a calculator, work it out and you would be surprised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is $375,000. It is a very challenging figure. When you think about that, you start to realise that trying to pick winners and losers in this industry game is not a very clever policy. What you need is a general policy but one that is sensitive to the social and economic needs of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a would&hyphen;be&hyphen;if&hyphen;he&hyphen;could&hyphen;be on the other side who interjects with the term `Captain Zero'. Undoubtedly he is looking at a portrait of Mr Gough Whitlam somewhere because that is exactly what he did to the industry which so devastated the people of Bass back in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it ill behoves the Australian Labor Party to think that somehow they have the right policy mix. If you have a look at the result of Berlei and if you have a look at the result of DuPont under Labor policy, they are closing down. They are the results of Labor policy. Yet have a look at what we did in the car industry and you get a $1 billion investment. That is a good result, a great result, for everybody and it will ultimately mean cheaper cars for the consumers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party is absolutely scared that we on this side of the chamber are going to do another good, sensible deal like we did with the car industry. So they are trying to get in first to try to champion the cause. But, of course, the Labor Party's record in this area is so abysmal that nobody is going to believe them or even suggest that they are going to regain any credibility in this policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our record is a very good record. Let me just remind the Senate of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said only yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the government receives the final report&mdash;  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5985">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I stress that that still has not been received yet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it will take a speedy decision, as it did with the motor manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are already on record as saying that we will act speedily as we did with the motor manufacturing industry. That was such a good policy result that you people are so upset by it. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in taking that decision, it will certainly pay very strong regard to the interests of employees in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the bottom line. The Prime Minister has given that commitment and the people of Australia can feel satisfied that that is going to be the policy outcome as it was with the car industry. As the Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard the closure of factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the employees, a tragedy for the City of Lithgow, but a tragedy for the region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is our concern. We have shared it and put it on the public record with the Australian people. We have shown our credentials in relation to the motor vehicle industry. We are accepted in the Australian community as doing the right thing in relation to tariffs. I am sure that everybody in their heart of hearts in this place knows that it is bad economic policy to simply perpetuate tariffs without giving consideration to their reduction to ensure benefits for the Australian consumers at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy, very simply, is one of responsibility, one of consideration and one of taking everything on board to ensure that whatever decision is taken will be one that factors into account all those competing interests&mdash;consumers wanting cheaper prices and consumers wanting a choice of a range of goods at affordable prices&mdash;whilst also ensuring the viability of Australian based industries which, at the moment, rely on tariffs, and which will be able to continue in a regime with lower tariffs if they are slowly weened off them to provide the sorts of results that we in Australia all look forward to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I highlight that this committee report on access to medical records was undertaken in recent times and is vitally important, because it deals with the issue of who owns medical records. There is a great deal of debate that has been going on in society as to who owns access to medical records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was the chair for the initial part of these hearings, and found this to be of a great deal of interest. There were some within the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5987"> medical profession who had a great deal of problem with this and who were adamant that they had ownership of the records. There was some hesitancy on the part of a number of people to give their patients access to records, because they had certain fears. Interestingly, some of these concerns were expressed by groups that you would have thought would express less concern than some other groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Psychiatrists deal with people who have mental illness and who may have a problem accepting and understanding their condition. They may well be in a fairly severe delusional state of mind which may include paranoia and psychoses. They may even have thoughts of self&hyphen;harm or harm to other people. However, psychiatrists were not as opposed as I think a number of people would have thought to their patients getting access to medical records. A number of psychiatrists wished to have support provided to the patient when the patient looked at the information that was contained in their medical record, and somebody available&mdash;maybe themselves or somebody else&mdash;to provide an explanation as to what the situation was. It was a very interesting situation in that the college and the psychiatrists understood and supported the need for their patients to understand their medical condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had some interesting submissions and evidence from lawyers. They felt that it could be beneficial if there was greater access to medical records in situations where the relationship between the doctor and the patient had broken down. At the moment, if patients want to look at their reports and their medical records and are unable to do so, sometimes the only way to do so is by instigating litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was concern on the part of the doctors that greater access to medical records would bring about increased litigation. But there was concern, and evidence was given by legal authorities, that people are often forced to undertake legal proceedings to get access to their medical records at the discovery stage of legal proceedings. If they were able to get access to their medical records prior to instigating legal proceedings, the situation would be explained to them: that there is no way 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that lawyers would advise them to undertake expensive and time consuming legal action. As this community becomes more litigious that situation has to be borne in mind. It is a very interesting professional judgment that a lot of people have to make. I have difficulty understanding why people are totally opposed to patients and clients knowing what is written in their medical and personal records, because what is written there is about the patient, about the person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given that people would use cryptic comments, would feel more constrained in what they write and would resort to having two sets of records. One has to wonder, though, about the medico&hyphen;legal aspects of this issue and the fact that all records can be summonsed or subpoenaed to be brought to court. One has to wonder about the fact that people are saying they will write less in records. There is a legal requirement for people to write full records. As someone who has written medical records, I would have thought it would be a polite requirement on the part of people when they do write their records that what they write is absolutely complete. There are ways to write some of these records: you do not have to make value judgments, and you should not make subjective judgments about people. You can write down the signs and symptoms and what the patient is complaining of without using whatever sort of slang term is current.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen medical records&mdash;certainly going back a number of years&mdash;with terms like `PF' written down. That means `purely functional' in polite terminology&mdash;it had other less polite terms. I was always concerned when I saw that sort of comment written on medical records, because subsequently there were a number of occasions when the patient actually did have a serious, complex or very discrete and obscure disease, and when the use of the letters `PF' would have caused quite significant problems for the medical personnel if they ended up in a court of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they had documented accurately and precisely the signs and symptoms about which the patient was complaining and left it up to people to make a judgment based on objective signs and the patient's subjective symptoms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5988"> of which they were complaining, then you would have got a more accurate picture of the patient. You would not have got a value judgment and you might have got a speedier diagnosis and therefore speedier treatment for some people who have required major forms of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue of major concern. I think people should have access to their medical records. I think many doctors these days are certainly very aware of this matter and do go to great lengths to make sure that their patients understand what is written in the files. That has to be the situation because we are wanting people to have greater compliance with treatment orders, and we are wanting people to have greater understanding of the treatments they are to undertake and the consequences and interactions of drugs, diagnoses and multiple diagnoses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way you can do that is if the patient has a significant understanding of their disease and of the treatment. Often, with some of the more obscure, rare diseases, it is the patient who develops a level of expertise about their own illness which many doctors do not fully have. If someone with an obscure, rare and difficult medical condition has spent 20 years having it diagnosed and finally settling on a treatment that works, the patient, in all likelihood, will know what the results of their tests should be, what their medications should be and what will interact with what for them, with their own idiosyncratic reactions. So I think it is vitally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to express some concerns about one or two of the witnesses who appeared before us. There were one or two who had very condescending attitudes, who said they would not tell a patient if there had been a little more bleeding than normal. They would tell patients a lot less; they would tell patients what they thought the patient needed to know. That is a very unfortunate attitude on the part of some in the medical profession. I am sure that Senator Herron, who is present in the chamber, would join me in saying it is the attitude of a very small number of doctors but, unfortunately, there are some out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is vitally important that patients do have access to their medical records and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the cuts that are taking place to the workloads of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner do not impact upon this government having a policy and implementing a legislative framework within which this can work. This is an issue of great significance to people, particularly those with chronic illness. For people who have only a one&hyphen;off illness, it might not be so much of a problem. Certainly, for people with chronic illness, the evidence we heard showed that it is a major problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words with regard to the second report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Australian legal aid system. This gives me a chance to highlight yet again the implications of government cuts to legal aid and the type of effect that has had on people's personal lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government seems to think that working people, women who have suffered domestic violence and so on, access legal aid to engage in average, day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day persiflage or to say to legal aid lawyers, `Look, yo&hyphen;ho, I'm here, I'm going to sue the next door neighbour because his or her dog barks at night.' The reality is that legal aid is far more serious than that. It ought to be a right. It is not in the nature of average Australian citizens to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5989"> finagle their way into a legal aid office and engage in frivolous litigation. It is a very serious matter. Many states have attempted to point out to the federal government that the cuts to legal aid have affected their budgets most seriously. We well recall the comments of many state premiers from both sides of politics in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth highlighting that one of the major difficulties with the cuts to legal aid is in the area of domestic violence. Many women now have nowhere to go. Many women now have no access to litigation. Many women now have no access to no&hyphen;cost legal care where they are in a relationship which has a domestic violence element to it. Of course, whether it comes under federal or state jurisdiction is still under debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great shame and it adds to the litany of woe that this government has perpetrated upon Australian women with regard to a number of regressive and retrograde measures. There are the cuts to legal aid funding and child care. I refer also to the new industrial relations bill, which impacts most severely upon women. I could go on and on. Cuts to higher education have impacted on women disproportionately, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth highlighting that this severe budget measure is having an impact now. It is impacting disproportionately on women. We regard this measure as regressive and retrograde. It is something that we will ensure will be addressed when we get back into government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard the shadow parliamentary secretary speaking on this subject and that is what brought me to the chamber. Senator Conroy was about to summons me. I thank him for that. I start by congratulating the Australian Labor Party for choosing Senator Mackay and Senator Lundy, an eminent senator from the Australian Capital Territory, as shadow parliamentary secretaries. I should add to the list Mr Kelvin Thomson, a member of the House of Representatives, whose selection is almost as good as the two in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Mackay has said, the issue of legal aid is very important. It is not simply a matter of trying to provide people who need 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representation with that representation but is a matter of how our legal system is going to work. We can take the criminal system as an example. By and large the prosecution in any criminal trial will be well resourced. The same cannot be said, in every case, for the defence of the accused. It is bad that a contest&mdash;and that is what it is in the adversarial system&mdash;which may well conclude in someone losing his or her liberties should be conducted unevenly between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the field of criminal law, it is that concept that makes it necessary that there is equality between the parties. In other words, society has an obligation not only to see that people who are accused of criminal offences are properly prosecuted but also to see that those people are also properly defended. Otherwise, the concept of justice which underpins the society we live in is denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now address some of the issues that Senator Mackay raised. There may be a contest where a woman has proper grounds for fearing for her life and limb and fearing for the life and limb of her children. Clearly, the woman and the children should be properly represented and so should the husband against whom the accusations have been brought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some fearful accusations can be made and unless people are properly defended that can cause great concern. Take for example the issue of paedophilia, which is a matter that concerns the public generally. That crime was traditionally called the crime of a rock spider. People who are convicted of the offence of violating young children are very badly treated in gaol. It is only proper that anybody convicted of that offence is convicted using the proper processes. It would be dreadful if someone accused of that crime were convicted of that crime&mdash;with all the consequences to his or her life&mdash;without the proper process being followed. The issue of legal aid goes to the question of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are budgetary restraints. There is always a demand for resources. I see that Senator Herron is in the chamber. In his area, indigenous people clearly need more resources. If there is one thing that a society should deliver its citizens it is justice. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5990"> England, and it is from that place that we generally derived the system under which we live, the king had three functions&mdash;making the law, carrying out the law and providing justice. Those three arms were separated out, particularly in the American constitution. That has set the modern plan for good government, which is that those three functions should be separated. Those three functions are basic to government. They are what governance is all about. If a society cannot provide those three basic elements it fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government does fail in providing justice if it allows people to go into a legal contest without there being some semblance at least of equality between the parties. You can never get absolute equality. There are going to be differences in the sort of representation that is available, but there ought to be a balance that is sufficient to satisfy a reasonable onlooker and make them say, `Yes, there is justice being done in this case.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not happening at the moment because people have not got the resources to properly exercise their rights, to properly make a defence of their position or, alternatively, to vindicate their position. It is important, therefore, that we as a national parliament keep wrestling with, not the issue of legal aid&mdash;that is part of what we should be wrestling with&mdash;but this necessity to provide a fair system under which we all may live. We are presently doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person who sits next to me, Senator McKiernan, is presently conducting an inquiry through the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on this very point. I hope it is productive. People across the party line are working very hard at it. Senator Abetz is the deputy chairman of that committee. I hope and expect that great things will come from that inquiry. They need to so that we can see that the government under which we live&mdash;when I talk about `government', I am talking about the three arms of government&mdash;is properly conducted in this country.</PARA>

This is not a reflection on any individual party and it is not a question of being partisan. The western suburbs of Melbourne have many roads that are unsealed, and many streets have lighting which would be of more use if they were just table lamps. People have ignored that situation for too long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen recommendations came out of this report and, unfortunately, not enough of them have been followed up. They talk about tree lines and a black powder mill, and existing structures which should be demolished. They look at expert advice on the remediation options. But there has not been enough commitment from the state and federal governments. The need to decontaminate this area is still there. I invite senators&mdash;including Senator Patterson&mdash;when visiting Melbourne to go to Deer Park, to have a look around and to see for themselves what has continued to be a waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine if children&mdash;young girls&mdash;went out there in their taffeta dresses in among all that contamination? It would be a tragedy. They have had to fence the area off and because of that it has become extremely run down and almost like a tip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge senators to read this report and to encourage their federal and state colleagues to get behind this project so that they can improve the lifestyles of people in the western suburbs of Melbourne.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that Senator Conroy raised the issue of Deer Park. The factories out at Deer Park were quite famous. During wartime, they did a lot of production which was necessary for the defence efforts of Australia, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I know that from personal knowledge because at that stage I was going to the Deer Park state school which was in the local hall, the former Deer Park state school having burnt down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember people used to go to work in the munition factory, as we used to call it, when they were 14.

That shows, perhaps, the dangerous enthusiasm of youth. Fortunately, I was not old enough then to work in a factory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to Senator Conroy brought back those memories and I think he is right. I think there ought to be a lot of work done to preserve a site in the western suburbs which is quite historic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on the development of Australia's air links with Latin America is important. It arises out of work which the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee started in about 1991&hyphen;92 when we did an inquiry into Australia's relationships with Latin America. Prior to then, a lot of people's understanding of Latin America was very persiflageous&mdash;one of Carmen Miranda and that was about it. People had no understanding of it being a very important conti 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5992"> nent and one that, in trading relations, can have a significant impact on and relationship with Australia. One of the findings from that initial report was that transport links, particularly air links, between Australia and Latin America are difficult. They are sparse and, I think it is fair to say, not terribly well pursued from the Australian point of view, particularly back then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report focused people's minds on a very important part of the world&mdash;our neighbours on the other side of the Pacific Ocean&mdash;and highlighted some of the difficulties that they were experiencing or that were impeding our relationships. There were about 11 recommendations made in this report and I am pleased to see that the government accepts and supports a lot of them, which will be important in continuing the important links between this country and Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, we have seen a significant increase in some areas of trade and manufacturing industry. We have seen the Australian mining sector discover Latin America and have a significant input into many of the mines over there and into developing relationships with the countries and companies to be able to exploit and bring to fruition many of the mines. You see BHP with l'Escondida and you see a lot of other areas where there is significant prospecting being undertaken. This is not just of importance to Australia; it is of significance to the Latin&hyphen;American countries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a tourism point of view, Australia is not a large tourism market. The number of people of Latin-American origin living in this country is not particularly large. One of the reasons for that probably does relate to things such as transport links between the two continents, but there is potential there for tourists from Latin America to visit Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This potential can only be realised if the air services do improve. There are several flights a week from Buenos Aires through to Australia via New Zealand, but the majority of people probably end up having to fly from Sydney or Melbourne into Papeete and Tahiti and then across. With the connection in Papeete, you may be faced with a 10- or 12-hour or an even longer delay, which is not the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most conducive incentive for people to travel. Business people also have many complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way to fly&mdash;particularly to the eastern coast of Latin America, the South American continent&mdash;is to fly from here to Los Angeles and then to Miami and then down, particularly if you are flying to Brazil. Those are long trips. It takes more than 30 hours to fly. That is very tiring, and it is not particularly conducive to encouraging travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect which needs to be taken into account in our relations is the language in Latin America. Spanish and Portuguese are the two languages spoken. I think this reflects poorly on Australians in that we do not have the correct attitude towards learning other languages. We expect and assume that people will all speak English. We forget that Spanish, English and Chinese are the three most commonly spoken languages in the world. Not necessarily this report, but I think the other report certainly highlighted the need for the Australian education system to undertake and encourage Australian students to learn another language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were issues of fifth freedom rights in relation to Aerolineas Argentinas and their being able to fly beyond New Zealand. The government will consider this in any market, based on an assessment of the additional benefits to Australia through the provision of lower fare levels, higher service quality and other gains. This is an area where the air fare costs tend not to be part of the large discounting that occurs in a number of other air routes that are operating out of Australia, such as to the UK and some of the Asian ports. So I think it certainly behoves the industry and the government to look to ways that can be conducive to a fare regime that makes it more accessible to people to travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the committee's report and the committee's ongoing interest in Australia's Latin-American relations has been significant in bringing this important area of the world to the front of people's minds&mdash;to encourage the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to focus on the importance of Latin America. We are certainly seeing at this present time that we are competing with them in a number of areas. As I said earlier, they have benefited 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5993"> from the expertise from our mining companies. We are a competitor, of course, in the mining industry. We are a competitor with Chile in the wine industry and the exporting of wine, particularly to Europe. It will certainly provide competition for the Australian vintners to meet that challenge. So it is an important industry. It is an important market for Australia. It is an important group of countries for us to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that this report has had quite a number of favourable responses from the government. It is an issue. Latin-American relations are something that the Senate committee has, as I say, pursued for about five or six years now. I think they will continue to pursue it, because it is an important area. Australians need to remember that it is reasonably close to us. It certainly is in the same hemisphere. Therefore, we understand a number of their climatic conditions and, because of their industry similarities, a number of the problems and the challenges that they face. So I would commend the report and the government response to people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While this response cannot be considered persiflage, it certainly is not a series of responses I would have expected. I would have thought that the government, in their response, would have been far more aggressive, particularly when we consider ourselves to be so close in a sense to the Latin-American nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the response by the government that they do acknowledge that there are significant future opportunities for increased business activity, tourism and investment. They do talk about bilateral air service agreements with both Chile and Argentina. There is also a draft agreement with Brazil. However, I do not believe that the response by the government, whilst it refers to things such as hubbing and opportunities that are there, really addresses the issues that are raised in the original report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, if one looks at chapter 3, for example, one gets an idea of the increasing market that is coming forth there. Chapter 3 is about passengers, and there are a number of questions that are raised: who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are they, how many are there and where are they going? You do not have to say, `Yo-ho, come over here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts speak for themselves. From 1981 to 1994, we saw a growth in passenger movements between Australia and South America: Argentina 8.96 per cent; Brazil 7.92 per cent; Chile 7.5 per cent; and others 4.56 per cent&mdash;with a total growth of 7.14 per cent. But specifically in the years 1993 to 1995 Argentina showed an increase of 45 per cent, Brazil 45 per cent and Chile 21 per cent. There is definitely no need for us to finagle our way into the Latin&hyphen;American market. They will undoubtedly welcome us with open arms as part of the broader Pacific community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe this is sufficiently well addressed in this report. I believe that the report shows a severe amount of verbosity, without getting down to the real central issue that&mdash;as my colleague Senator West has said&mdash;people currently have to go via Papeete, and that that is not good enough if we are to be an emerging nation not only in the Asian region but in areas such as Latin America which are vastly untapped by us. The report recognises the opportunities that are available there for the Australian people and the Australian government, and the response, whilst it goes part of the way to recognising that we need to do more, does not go far enough.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I address my comments to the annual report of the University of Canberra. I do so on the basis that this particular institution forms a significant part of Canberra's educational community. At a time when the Canberra economy is experiencing great challenges, it is our educational institutions that continue to be pillars, if you like, in providing some stability for the economic future of the town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra is unique in many respects. I would like to pay tribute to one of the programs that exists within the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5994"> Faculty of Management, and that is the Centre for Regional and Local Government Studies. This centre has done some incredibly important work in focusing some academic substance on the concept of regional studies and, in particular, on regional economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this government will continue to finagle the confidence of regional Australia, what we have here in the Centre for Regional and Local Government Studies is something which is getting out the nuts and bolts of the parts of initiatives that make up comprehensive regional development plans. Having previously been a member of the regional economic development organisation for Canberra and the south&hyphen;east region of New South Wales, the absolute importance of this type of work is clear to me. As part of my comments, I would first like to recognise the significant work of that centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another comment I would like to make with respect to the University of Canberra is about the student support structures on campus. Having recently visited the university during the University of Canberra's `Do you see green?' week, which focused on environment initiatives and a whole range of activities relating specifically to the university's environmental programs, it became very clear to me that the child&hyphen;care cuts initiated by the federal government have impacted severely on the student support services with respect to the child&hyphen;care centre on campus, Kirinari.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of the operational subsidy to that particular centre has put real pressure on the service it provides. It is the mature age students&mdash;predominantly women, but also many men&mdash;on campus who find the additional costs the straw that breaks their weekly budget's back when it comes to their choice or opportunity to enter tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to this government in that respect: how about you look beyond the persiflage of your own rhetoric with respect to child care and have a look at how it is impacting upon real  people, in this case the students, and particularly the mature age students, at the University of Canberra, and the disadvantages that they are now suffering as a result of those cuts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to recognise the fact that two people were awarded honorary doctorates at the University of Canberra this year&mdash;Donald Richmond Horne and Phillip William Hughes&mdash;in recognition of their work in that regard in 1996. Also, to everyone in the students association at the University of Canberra, I give a big yo-ho. You are doing a great job out there. I would like to say to everybody involved in the students association at the University of Canberra that you are doing a terrific job and your contribution to that particular educational institution is worthy of recognition in this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is a result of an inquiry that was conducted by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee earlier this year. When I last spoke about this report, I mentioned some concerns I had about the difficulties that were expressed to us in relation to the grief experienced by families as a result of deaths overseas. That was not the sole focus of the report. There were a number of other recommendations in that report, and I would hope at some stage to see a considered view of them from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those recommendations touched a number of issues which one could not take lightly but which a lot of Australians do not necessarily take great cognisance of when they travel. In particular, I refer to travellers taking out adequate insurance cover, because this can affect people, particularly if death is experienced overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that was drawn to our attention during the inquiry was the very heavy costs associated with bringing a dead person back from overseas. Whilst people do not like to think about that side of life&mdash;or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5995"> death to be more precise&mdash;nonetheless, it was very important that this issue came out in the inquiry as quite substantial costs are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this inquiry serves no other purpose or if my addressing this chamber this evening serves no other purpose than to draw the attention of the Australian public to the fact that they should take out adequate insurance, then something would have been achieved. In the recommendation, there is also an urging to have this done through the travel agencies, because it is something that people are just not in any way cognisant of, and it is something that is very important indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I found interesting in the report was the fact that the committee recognised there was a need to institute a formal counselling program for consular officers as soon as possible when they have been in touch with members of the public who have suffered a loss overseas. I think this was highly admirable, and I am sure it is one of the recommendations that the government will respond to in a positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a lighter side though, there were some interesting expectations expressed to us of how the Australian tourist overseas sees the role of the Australian embassy or the Australian high commission. In one instance, it was reported to us that some Australians had an expectation that, at grand final time, the Australian embassy or high commission would make available to them a direct telecast of the Aussie Rules grand final. Whilst that might be a highly laudable and praiseworthy task for the embassies and high commissions to undertake, it certainly is not one of their duties or roles. Some Australians, unfortunately, have a distorted view of the role and the function of our embassies and high commissions  overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the report in itself, which touches a wide range of issues, is something which is highly worth reading. I trust that the government will give us some very positive responses to a report that was arrived at in a fairly harmonious way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak to this government's commitment to listening to the women of Australia and to addressing the real issues for Australian women. Today and yesterday I had the great pleasure of meeting with women's organisations present here in Canberra for the national women's round table consultations, organised by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Jocelyn Newman. Never before&mdash;certainly never under Labor&mdash;have women had a two&hyphen;day opportunity to network and meet with members, senators, ministers, advisers and departmental officials. For example, today the minister had organised for advisers from various departments, and senior staff from ministers' offices, to come and meet with the women to discuss issues in an informal way over lunch. Every opportunity was used to make sure they had as much contact with government as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not hyperbole to say that many of the women attending have been frankly stunned that the federal Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women actually stayed and listened to what they had to say. The national women's round table is only one of the consultative mechanisms put into place by this government. The major mechanism for Australian women to put their concerns to government is the massive number of coalition women listening and consulting with their constituents all over Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own home state of Victoria, women make up the majority of the Liberal Senate team. And we had no dodgy quotas. We did not have to ask the union men or the faction hard men for permission to take our places here and in the other place. The coalition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5996"> rewards merit&mdash;and merit alone earned the record number of coalition women their places at the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has appointed a number of these coalition women to a parliamentary advisory group, of which I am the Victorian representative. Like all of my colleagues on the parliamentary advisory group, I have been busy meeting and consulting with women in my state, listening to the concerns of Victorian women and feeding them back to the minister. At the same time I have had the support of the state minister responsible for the status of women, who has sent either her senior adviser or one of the senior departmental officers to also list the issues of state and federal concerns or state concerns alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns I have heard from many of the women I have met with over the last few months has been the concern about older women in the Australian community. I have been pleased to advise them that this government shares their concerns and that we have addressed Labor's shameful neglect of older women. Older women were the forgotten women under Labor. In the glamour and hoopla of Mr Keating's smoke and mirrors women's policy, they were not even thrown the bone of a meaningless quota. After all, the biggest thing women ever got under Labor was a quota, with a commitment to fulfilling that quota entirely optional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to address this government's commitment to older women and particularly the ways in which we will continue to help them achieve financial security in later life. By 2020, one in every four Australian women will be over 55. As the number of older people as a proportion of the population increases, so will the number of older women as a proportion of the older population. Latest figures show that there are 76 men for every 100 women in the 65&hyphen;plus age group and only 42 men for every 100 women in the 85&hyphen;plus age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mass media, if she is mentioned at all, the older woman is often portrayed as a social vampire&mdash;frail, dependent and requiring expensive care in a residential nursing facility. Older women are depicted either as a collec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of symptoms or as an object of pity and scorn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who were at the dinner last night, hosted by Minister Newman, and saw the Older Women's Network theatre group performing would have realised that all those myths, all those stereotypes, are wrong. They are the most energetic, lively group of people who put through theatre their living of life, despite for some of them disabilities with arthritis and other health problems that may have reduced their physical ability. But their spirit was strong and the message they had for all of us there was that there was a lot of living to do if you were an older person and, in particular, if you were an older woman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 10 years I campaigned against the inequity of compulsory retirement in the Commonwealth Public Service. I introduced into this place two private members' bills across two parliamentary sessions and hardly raised a headline. I got no support from the Labor Party or from the Democrats. There was always some feeble excuse about the fact that we could not cope with compensation for people over 65 with Workcare, Comcare and whatever else. It was an inadequate response. All the other states had managed to do it. Yet always Labor came up with some sort of hurdle that meant they were unable or unwilling to do it, and the Democrats went along with it. I regretted that for a long time. I thought it was a private member's bill that had a great deal of merit. So the same groups who so noisily protested at any attempt at discrimination against young women or working women, as they rightly should, were inexplicably mute when it came to protecting the rights of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older women working in the Public Service, many of whom had interrupted careers with child bearing, wished to keep working to compensate for lost earnings due to caring earlier in their careers. Yet no group sprang to their defence, no&hyphen;one lobbied on their behalf and no-one supported me, other than my colleagues on this side of the chamber, in my attempts to redress what I thought was a discriminatory part of the  Public Service Act. More than anything, this proved to me the tacit acceptance of discrimination against 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5997"> older people which exists in Australian society and the deeper disinterest in the aspirations of older women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night when the Older Women's Network were doing their performance one line they used was that age is an activity practised by the temporarily young. I thought how right they were. The government has broken ranks with Labor inaction and implemented real and effective changes for older women. The new Public Service Act before this parliament will eliminate that discriminatory aspect of making people retire when they reach 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deferred pension bonus plan is also an important thing for older women. It was introduced in the last budget by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. It recognises that some women who have broken their careers with their caring responsibilities may wish to continue participating in the work force. Under the plan, people who choose to keep on working, defer the taking up of an age or service pension and continue to work for at least 25 hours a week, will accrue a bonus of 9.4 per cent of his or her basic pension entitlement. This bonus will accrue for each year of employment beyond age or service pension age up to a maximum of five years. The bonus will be paid as a lump sum on pension take&hyphen;up and will be tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential value of this to older women, particularly an older woman who has been widowed or divorced, cannot be overestimated. Sixteen per cent of women aged 60 to 64 years and 71 per cent of women aged 85 years and over are widows. Forty per cent of women aged 65 and over live alone with sole financial responsibility for the upkeep of their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum bonus of $21,251 for a single pensioner and $34,450 for a couple could be used to pay for major expenditures before retirement. We have also worked out that, if it was depleted over a period, it would provide a significant amount on an annual basis for the emergency things such as roofing, hot water services or whatever else that tend to breakdown and that are very difficult to repair when you are on a pension. Whether it is getting rid of the old clunker car and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> getting a new one or getting the house repainted or the roof repaired, this plan can be used by older women to make the major expenditures they could never otherwise afford, giving them peace of mind and security in retirement. Of course it will not be taken up by everyone, but it is there and it is a choice and it is an option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other developments that have come into place such as the guarantee for the aged pension, savings rebate and other measures which we have introduced. One of the other things is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has appointed a conference for older Australians to address the issue of the International Year of Older Persons in 1999. We will be consulting with the community to look for ways and means in which we can address issues that affect older people, particularly older women&mdash;issues such as flexibility in housing and other areas of concern. It demonstrates that we are a government which is concerned about older women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5997"><TITLE>South Australia: Leader of the Opposition</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to point out that yesterday, when the government whip refused me permission to table these documents because of orders on high from somewhere else, he in fact did my side of the story immeasurable benefit. Why? As soon as he refused to allow it to be tabled, the press and everybody believed that there is a cover-up going on here, and the reporting of the story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  today, I have to say, exceeded my expectations, particularly the headline `Howard covers up for Olsen'. What a great headline that was, and it was all because of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the stupidity of the government whip and the leadership of the Liberal Party in this Senate in refusing to allow me to table the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the coverage the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> gave, they also pointed out my remarks on the conflict of interest&mdash;that is, the firm that advised the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, Minter Ellison, is also the firm advising the Premier. I put it correctly in context that they had received advice that there was no conflict of interest. That was reported accurately in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only part of the documents that I put into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> yesterday that I was disappointed did not get a mention&mdash;and I hope it will get a mention in the future&mdash;is the extraordinary defence of the Premier, saying, `I didn't give information to Mr Rann about the Catch Tim donation scandal.' It was given to Mr Rann by one Alex Kennedy, then a journalist with the Messenger Press in Adelaide, who had formerly been employed by former Senator Olsen, who was employed for a short time by Senator Ferguson, who then went and worked for the Messenger Press and spent those two or three years dumping heaps of vitriol on Mr Brown as the Premier. Within a month or so of becoming the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen re&hyphen;employed Alex Kennedy as his chief speech writer and senior adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are expected through Liberal denials to believe there is no division in the Liberal Party in South Australia and that Mr Olsen, Mr Brown and their supporters are not leaking against each other. It is an extraordinary episode in South Australian political history, even Australian political history, when the Liberal Party, the Liberal government, is cannibalising itself the way it is at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying, again, that I thank Senator Calvert as government whip for refusing me leave to table the documents. I think next time round he will get better advice. I would also like to say that, now this issue is before the public in South Australia, they will see what a dreadful, divided government the Olsen government is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my second adjournment speech on this subject&mdash;that is, the Kimberley region. On Monday night this week, I spoke about the growing sense of concern that this remarkable region is going to be caught up in a development frenzy which is misplaced and which has the potential to result in us as a community losing far more than we gain. If currently proposed developments go ahead, the character and quality of the region will be changed more rapidly and more permanently than ever before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a short list of planned or proposed developments: plans to greatly expand the Ord River irrigation scheme; plans for the damming of the Fitzroy River, the largest river in the Kimberley and one of Australia's few remaining large wild rivers; plans for a major irrigation area and cotton growing industry potentially covering some 200,000 hectares in the Pindan plains south of Broome; the trucking of large volumes of lead&hyphen;zinc concentrates through Derby to be shipped out of King Sound; ongoing proposals for aquaculture and tourism developments around the coast; plans for a tidal power station in mangrove creeks near Derby; and the possibility of several new mines in different parts of the region, including the prospect of a bauxite mine on the acclaimed Mitchell Plateau.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from such particular projects, increasing human access and activity across the region will bring with it a range of other severe environmental consequences. These include damage caused by increasing numbers of tourists visiting largely unmanaged and fragile natural environments, wildlife smuggling, widespread and frequent human lit bushfires and the introduction and spread of exotic and feral pest species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a large extent, the major development projects referred to are being considered in isolation. Open-ended ad hoc development seems to be the order of the day as government and industry work hand in glove to ensure the go-ahead for projects which have enormous environmental, social and cultural implications for the region as a whole. While 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of these development projects may benefit the state or Australia, how can we assess them unless proper coordination, evaluation and assessment processes are conducted and, what is more, unless assessments are done independently, not by the proponents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No overall sustainable development strategy is being given serious consideration. For example, while the major environmental costs and lessons of stage 1 of the Ord River dam and irrigation scheme have never been assessed, the state government is rushing to try to open up a further 60,000 hectares of Ord irrigated land in the east Kimberley. Our view is assessment first, project later. The state government's view is project first, assessment later. The fee takers and commission makers are once again leading this government in Western Australia by the nose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential impacts of this project alone on internationally important wetlands at the mouth of the Ord, on riparian habitats, on ground water levels and salinity, on levels of pesticides and fertiliser in soils and waters, are alarming. If this project continues to be pushed in the way it currently is, there is a very real chance that future generations will be left with long-term costs that rival the problems now evident as a result of the ill-considered agricultural expansionism in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia. At present rates of government inaction and weakness, much of the south&hyphen;west is economically doomed because of salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efforts that are being made at a state level on the environment front, notably the preparation of a regional conservation plan by the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;also known to me as Genghis CALM&mdash;and some limited localised assessments by the WA Department of the Environment, are unlikely to amount to more than tokenism. The current political climate, coupled with a dismal history of previous government conservation efforts, and the totally inadequate budgets of CALM and the DEP&mdash;the Department of Environmental Planning&mdash;all suggest a lack of any real commitment to environmental protection in the Kimberley or any real commitment to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6001"> economic sustainability that delivers long-term benefit to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wider public meanwhile is barely aware that the character of the Kimberley is in the process of being irretrievably changed over a matter of just a couple of decades. It is difficult for people to comprehend environmental fragility, but the Kimberley has many fragile areas, with conservation values of recognised national and international importance at stake. We have now reached a critical point in the region's history, a point at which a strong national interest must be taken. Without strong national interest&mdash;inside federal parliament and state parliament and outside in the community&mdash;a narrow, short&hyphen;term and ultimately self&hyphen;defeating form of development looks likely to prevail, and the public interest will lose as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate and the Commonwealth government to take active leadership in shaping the future of this remarkable and beautiful region of Australia. By all means let us have development, but let it be carefully considered, consultative, well planned and with an agreed framework that takes proper account of and meets the needs of the region's environment, the Aboriginal traditional owners, the wider community, and future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first step must be to address the lack of coordinated and objective policies and strategies for ecologically and economically sustainable development. It must be to address the lack of sound regional planning, and it must be to address environmental protection and the lack of resources to implement environmental protection. In the meantime, while these fundamentals are put in place, we should seek to have the types of large&hyphen;scale industrial developments discussed above put on hold. We can always come back to them later if they are found to have merit, but we will not be able to repair the damage they do if they are rushed ahead with and later found to have been big mistakes, as many Australian big bang projects have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I close, I would like to dwell briefly on the response of Senator Eggleston to my first adjournment speech on this matter. He made a number of remarks. I think he has to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understand that what we are talking about here is an appraisal of all these development schemes on a coordinated regional basis before the projects go ahead. We are also talking about putting those appraisals in the hands of independent and objective analysts and not in the hands of those who will in fact benefit from the very schemes that they are appraising and doing their feasibilities on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Eggleston referred to the water of the Fitzroy as `not utilised'. The Fitzroy River ecosystem, from the headwaters to King Sound, uses all the waters of the river. It is adapted to and relies on seasonal flooding and the seasonal drying of the river. Harvesting this water will necessarily have many impacts. Some of those impacts might well be beneficial, but many may not. You cannot regard this as a waste area where the water is just going to waste. It is very much part of the entire environment there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also referred to&mdash;here we have the big numbers that the Liberals love&mdash;`the food and fibre crops to generate at least $900 million a year'. I would have thought it would have been far better to have said that that would feed a certain number of people. But the real value to the Liberals is the amount of money involved, not the amount of value to human beings and whether it would generate food and work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know how the market for cotton will continue, especially with more and more producers coming into the market. We also do not know whether other products proposed to be grown could survive or thrive or be saleable and sold, or would be better alternatives to cotton. What we do know is that cotton has some serious environmental drawbacks, and there are many ways in which, in this environment, such crops may never succeed. So when you talk about $900 million a year, it really is a thumb suck at this stage of evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Eggleston went on and said that `no appraisal is being undertaken'. That is a deliberate misrepresentation of what I had said. What I said was that no appraisal had been undertaken with regard to the whole spectrum of Kimberley development proposals, not just the Fitzroy project. I also said 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6002"> that the evaluation of the Fitzroy project, at this stage, was inadequate and elementary and needed to be far better done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He mentioned the WAI, the organisation that is to do this feasibility study. He said, `It is WAI's plan to harvest 25 per cent of the annual flow. . . '. Once a dam is built, even though WAI's intention may be to use 25 per cent, other developers may well then come forward wanting a slice of the action. That happened in the Murray-Darling scenario, which is now one of acute degradation and real danger to Australia's breadbasket. Either way, the percentage of annual flow that is to be dealt with does not matter all that much, because once dams are constructed, an irreversible process of development and destruction can be set in motion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6002"><TITLE>Alice Springs to Darwin Railway Line</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When is a promise not a promise? What does trust have to do with truth? In May 1983 the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, promised the people of Australia that only his Labor government could be trusted to build the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. He made a promise, he gave an undertaking, an assurance. He offered trust, a firm belief, a confidence based on expectation. In fact, he laid his credibility on the line&mdash;the railway line. Just 10 months later it became another of his broken promises. In March 1984 Prime Minister Hawke described the railway as `totally unrealistic and uneconomic'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, he was not the first Labor Prime Minister to make promises and give undertakings on this particular issue. More than half a century before, in 1910, Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher made another national promise. He even passed legislation to specifically fund the completion of the north&hyphen;south rail link. Now we know the answer: a promise is not a promise when it is made by the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of this matter is that the Labor Party was never really committed to the railway link. Former Senator Peter Walsh described it as a `waste of money' and `a white elephant'. Former Treasurer John Dawkins called it `a crazy idea'. Even the dethroned emperor himself could not work out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why South Australians wanted a railway at all. A wacky comment if ever I heard one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy President, only this government has made a commitment, an undertaking, that we will put some money where their mouth was. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has put $100 million beside the commitments of the Northern Territory and South Australian governments. So, 87 years after it was first promised by the Fisher Labor government, the Alice to Darwin railway can finally be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was privileged to be with friends and colleagues last weekend when the Prime Minister stood with my own state Premier, John Olsen, and the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Shane Stone, to become the first government to specifically and financially commit to this visionary national project. By the end of the year 2002 our nation will be linked north to south and east to west by a railway traversing some of our most ancient and starkly beautiful landscapes. This is the second key project stemming from the Federation Fund established to support major national objectives, providing much needed infrastructure and creating vital jobs for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obvious benefits: a rapid competitive rail system, an important opportunity to provide alternative transport for our developing mineral and resource processing in the very rich Gawler Craton in my home state of South Australia. The rapidly expanding markets of Asia will have speedy access to the fresh produce of the farmers of South Australia. We will offer the opportunity to develop the world's best practice rail link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, Madam Deputy President, I ask you and all other members of this parliament to pause for a moment to consider the small South Australian community of Port Augusta; a town ravaged by unemployment stemming from the disgraceful mismanagement of Australia National by the previous government. Members of the Senate committee looking at the sale of AN heard quite a heartbreaking story in evidence during a visit to Port Augusta: breakdown of families, domestic violence and financial tragedy stemming from the tide of joblessness that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6003"> washed over the railway workshops under the Labor Party's reign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the community has regained a little more hope, a slight sense of optimism flowing not only from this announcement but from the benefits arising from the sale of Australia National which was announced today. The news that AN will be sold for $95 million is especially good news for the businesses and the families of Port Augusta. Under the new arrangements, Port Augusta will become a principal engineering hub, and the existing workshops will expand to take in other work&mdash;a breath of life for a small country town and its families after years of disgraceful neglect by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whyalla, also a city feeling the cold winds of change and joblessness, stands to benefit from the steel needed for this very important new national rail project. One hundred and fifty&hyphen;five thousand tonnes of steel rail and 3,500 tonnes of structural steel will be required to build the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway. As well, 9.2 million spring steel fasteners and 2.3 million sleepers using 170,000 tonnes of steel will be needed for the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The weekend announcement of this exciting new national project to link Australia's north and south has given a much needed boost to my home state of South Australia. Our government's announcement at the weekend interestingly enough reflects the quite realistic view, I think, of the former Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran. In 1995 he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under the 10-point plan, existing Commonwealth, state and territory legislation for land, heritage, land use planning and environmental management will remain in place and must still be complied with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The 10-point plan does not propose blanket upgrading of pastoral lease titles. Under the existing Native Title Act 1994, states and territories can already acquire native title rights if they do it through non-discriminatory means. This will continue. The Commonwealth understands that state and territory governments do not intend to undertake large scale upgrading of pastoral leases to freehold through the acquisition of native title rights.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator Ellison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) In the 1996/97 Budget a $1.5 million saving to the HREOC budget was announced. The reduction applies as a result of the proposal, contained in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, to transfer the HREOC hearing function to the Federal Court. As that Bill is still awaiting passage, the Department of Finance has agreed that the reduction in funding will not apply until the function has been transferred to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction to HREOC funding in this financial year (1997/98) is, in real terms, only the 4% efficiency saving applicable to all agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further reduction in HREOC funding in subsequent years (1998/99 and beyond) amounts in real terms to approximately a 27% reduction&mdash;not the 40% or more some people have claimed. However, this reduction must be seen in light of the fourfold increase in HREOC funding over the past nine years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In evidence to the Senate Estimates Committee on 10 June 1997, the Commission indicated that it will refocus its activities and concentrate re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6009"> sources on its main statutory functions, and in particular, on complaint handling. While the Commission has indicated that it expects to lose up to one third of its staff, the bulk of this loss will come from areas other than complaint handling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The present Disability Discrimination Commissioner's term does not expire in July 1997, but in December 1997. There is no suggestion that the current term of office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner is under threat and no decision has been made on a replacement for the Commissioner when her term expires at the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator Neal would be aware, the functions of the Human Rights, Race, Sex and Disability Discrimination Commissioners will be changed by the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill which is currently before the Senate. The major change involves the transfer of the complaint conciliation function to the President, and the complaint hearing function to the Federal Court, the latter change being brought about by the High Court's decision in the Brandy case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General has indicated that the Government will be considering further changes to the structure of HREOC. However, no decision has been made by the Government in this respect. Australians with disabilities can be assured that any changes to the structure to HREOC will not diminish the capacity of HREOC to uphold the principles of the Disability Discrimination Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill will consolidate the divergent complaint handling regimes in various Acts into one simplified scheme with common definitions and best practice pro

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also vests responsibility for the administration of the Commission in the office of the President. Those changes are designed to clarify the lines of responsibility and should lead to more consistent and coordinated management practices.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 19 December 1996, I wrote to the then WA Minister for Environment, the Hon Peter Foss QC MLC, seeking his assurance that the environmental assessment processes undertaken by the State had adequately addressed potential off-site impacts of the proposal, and that there would be no significant impact on the outstanding universal values of the Shark Bay World Heritage Property.</PARA>
