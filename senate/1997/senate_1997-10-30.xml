<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats believe that education should be available and accessible to all Australians, regardless of gender, age, health, background, racial or ethnic origin or place of residence. A distinction between part time and full time scholarships in our taxation laws imposes a restriction on the availability and accessibility to education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believe that education is a lifelong process and all education is of value. We believe education has an increasingly important place in a rapidly changing and multi&hyphen;dimensional world. These changes and dimensions require human beings to adapt and confidently deal with the new circumstances through improvisation and an understanding of change. So it is in this context that scholarships are available to assist and reward the developments of a person's talents. The benefits of this talent can be in art work, new ideas, a new angle to an old 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> theme or an achievement, and the list of possibilities goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of the taxing provision provides an interesting insight into what the scholarship exemption was supposed to achieve. In 1950, the Spooner committee reported to the Treasurer at the time, the Right Honourable A.W. Fadden. The terms of reference of the committee were to examine the desirability of exempting scholarship income from taxation. At the time, England and New Zealand exempted scholarships from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concluded that payments in the form of `awards to enable students to pursue a course of study' should be exempt, while payments in the nature of remuneration for present and future services and living allowances should be taxed. The committee proposed an amendment to section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and the words they suggested are informative. They suggested the section should be amended to exclude tax on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the income arising from a fellowship, scholarship or bursary held by a person receiving instruction at a university, college, school or other educational establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time, the education sector has undergone considerable change. The attacks by both the former government and the current government are eroding the sector and moving the divide between educational purposes and industry purposes closer together. This blending of purposes was well illustrated by the Debate over the amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, which removed the `rendering services' criteria from the full time scholarship provisions. That provision was modified by my amendments to the rendering services requirement and make sure full time scholarships were tax free. On this occasion it was notable that the Democrat's amendment was supported by all the other parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time, the concern was only about full time scholarships. However, part&hyphen;time scholarships are not covered by that provision, and if they satisfy all other aspects of that provision they will be taxed as the provision now stands. This is an unfortunate distinction, and this Bill will address that distinction by extending the exemption from taxation to part&hyphen;time scholarships which satisfy all the same criteria as tax exempt full time scholarships. This Bill proposes an amendment which abolishes the distinction between full time and part&hyphen;time scholarships and makes all scholarships which satisfy the other criteria in the existing provisions tax free. That is, any scholarship, bursary or other educational allowance or educational assistance received by a student receiving education at a school college or university will be exempt from tax as long as there an educational purpose involved and there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8417"> condition that the student will enter into employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the amendments to the tax status of full time scholarships I sought a response from the Government about part&hyphen;time scholarships. Question No. 296 lodged by me on 19 August 1997 and reported by the Senate Employment Education Training and Youth Affairs Legislation Committee asked:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the status of postgraduate scholarships made to part&hyphen;time students? Is the Government concerned that there may have been an oversight made in relation to tax on part&hyphen;time scholarships?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response was:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part&hyphen;time Australian Postgraduate Awards (with Stipend) are available to students who have been successful in gaining an award and who can demonstrate heavy care commitments or a medical condition precluding full time study.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part&hyphen;time scholarships are not exempt from tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The part&hyphen;time rate is set so that, after tax has been deducted, it is equivalent to 50% of the full time stipend.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no oversight in relation to tax on part&hyphen;time scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This response deals with a particular kind of scholarship known as Australian Postgraduate Awards. There are any number of other scholarships which will satisfy the requirements of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, but fail only because they are part&hyphen;time. But, this response fails to address the broader issues raised by the different tax status of part and full time scholarships. It is these differences which make this Bill an important measure to redress injustice by identifying and remedying inequalities and barriers to participation in our education system. We want the best, so we must make sure the best people are chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scholarships are provided to talented people to assist them to develop their talents. This has benefits for the individual, but it has a broader purpose which contributes directly to our community. We recognise this benefit by providing tax free full time scholarships. The same recognition should apply to part&hyphen;time scholarships. This has been recognised in part for Australian Postgraduate Awards by increasing the amount of the half scholarship to take into account the taxation effect. This recognition is welcome, and supports the contention the existing scheme is an anomaly which should be remedied. This is reason enough to make the amendment set out in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, and more importantly, this anomaly in the taxation legislation discriminates against part&hyphen;time scholarship holders. The discrimination arises from the fact that a person receiving a part&hyphen;time 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scholarship, who receives any further income and/or benefits based on the income they declare for taxation purposes, will be treated differently from a person who receives a full time scholarship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is best illustrated by example. Liz Darley is the recipient of a part&hyphen;time Australian Postgraduate Award which she received on the basis of merit at the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury. She needed to take this scholarship on a part&hyphen;time basis so that she could care for her two small children. The unfairness in this case arises from Liz being denied access to child care assistance and her family payment reduced because of her scholarship (and other) income. I want to quote her words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem I have is that full time scholarships are not taxed and therefore regarded as non&hyphen;taxable income; no group certificates are issued, and other benefits such as child care assistance and home child care allowance are not affected by the stipend. However, part&hyphen;time scholarships are regarded as taxable income. This affects the amount of child care rebate I am entitled to, as well as home child care allowance, and also means that if I undertake any extra work (such as teaching and tutoring) this work gets added to my scholarship as taxable income. A person on a full time scholarship does not have to declare their scholarship as income, so any extra income they make is considered as their only income. If I make  $5 000 on top of my scholarship of $8 253, then my taxable income is $13 252. If I took a full time scholarship of $15 000+, then my taxable income would be $5 000. I think you would agree this is inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a particular concern for women who make up a significant proportion of scholarship holders and a structural barrier to participation in higher education. Structural barriers in the education sector mean that talented people are excluded for reasons other than merit, such as gender, age, disability, ethnicity, etc.. For this reason alone, structural barriers must be removed to ensure our most talented students are provided with the opportunities to develop and express their special talents. Removing the distinction between part&hyphen;time and full time scholarship taxation, which this Bill does, is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liz's case also highlights other inequalities in the higher education sector which future legislation affecting the higher education sector and many other sectors must address&mdash;structural barriers to women's participation in the education system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN Fourth World Conference, Women's Platform for Action considered women in education as one of the twelve critical areas of concern addressed by the conference. Women's access to vocational training, science and technology and continuing education was specifically targeted in the list of actions to be taken by governments. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8418"> Platform of Action was agreed to by the former Labor Government, and the present Coalition Government has stated that it intends to uphold its commitments under the Platform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's commitment to abolishing structural barriers is doubtful and may be illustrated by an example. In May 1993 the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and the Minister for Science and Small Business established the Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WISET) Advisory Group to advise on strategies to improve women's participation in science, engineering and technology careers and education. The WISET Advisory Group prepared a report in the form of a discussion paper in May 1995 setting out some of the barriers facing women in science, engineering and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unhappy with the lack of response from the previous Government I asked the Coalition Government how they proposed to respond to the Advisory Group report. In response to a Question on Notice No. 447 dated 24 March 1997 the Minister for Science and Technology stated that the Advisory Group report would not be responded to because the "recommendations are more relevant to the outlook of the previous Government". Instead, the Government intends to pursue women's representation in science, engineering and technology areas by creating a "broad, positive environment in which all Australians have the maximum opportunity to achieve their potential". This includes the provision of non&hyphen;gender specific scholarships and awareness programs in relation to science, engineering and technology areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This response fails to recognise the systemic issues of discrimination identified in the Advisory Group report and will ensure that women in science, engineering and technology areas continue to face individual experiences of discrimination, and that women will not have equal access to representation in the science, engineering and technology community <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">as a right</EMPHASIS> . Unhappy with the response to Question No. 447 I asked a further Question on Notice No. 687 dated 7 July 1997. The Minister responded that the Government "is not aware of any structural barriers to women participating in science, engineering and technology careers" even though the Government has examined the WISET report. Does this mean the Government has rejected the WISET report?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time the Australian National University has received the Burton Report which identifies a range of (similar) structural barriers to women's participation in a non&hyphen;science section of the University. Clearly, there is a problem here and the Government, and former Government, are trying to ignore the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides the Government with an opportunity to meet their international commitments and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remove a measure which, as in Liz's case, specifically disadvantages women with small children participating in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of this proposal will be minimal and the outcomes in terms of equity are significant. I commend this Bill to the Senate as a measure directed at assisting talented Australians to achieve their full potential in a world where the benefits of highly educated persons are central to job creation and wealth for all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the fourth report by the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee&mdash;or its predecessors&mdash;on the format and contents of the explanatory material provided to senators for use in estimates hearings; and it is the thirteenth occasion on which the committee has reported on a matter referred to it by the Senate following the recommendation of another committee and arising out of the estimates process. Clearly the committee has acquired a role as watchdog and mouthpiece of the Senate's interest in these matters, a role I welcome as it enables the committee to build on a considerable body of expertise from the endeavours 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of previous members including fellow Taswegians Peter Rae and John Coates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion, the committee's inquiry originated from the difficulties many senators experienced in using the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) for 199697. This was a matter of some significance as the PBS are some of the most significant of the accountability documents presented to Parliament. The committee concluded that in part at least, the difficulties related to the fact that there had been machinery of government changes following the change of government in March 1996; there was a one-off return to an August budget; there were 15 new or inexperienced senators; and a number of former ministers coming to grips with the use of the documentation for the first time in Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conducting this inquiry, the committee sought the views of departments and agencies through their portfolio ministers and most responded with submissions and by sending representatives to the committee's round-table public hearing. The committee is extremely grateful for their helpful input and for that of the senators who participated in the hearing or the briefing with Finance. It singles out for particular thanks officers of the Department of Finance who have been of continuing assistance to the committee. The majority of senators was less forthcoming and the committee relied for the most part on extrapolating their views on the PBS from what was said in the estimates hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee considers that the chief function of the PBS is to explain the Appropriation Bills. The fact that the legislation committees considering the estimates range far and wide does not mean that the PBS should attempt to second-guess senators' interests and attempt to cater for them in the documentation. The Department of Finance circulates its PBS guidelines widely for comment every year, so the opportunity is there through this committee or any legislation committee to have input to the format of the documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After examining the evidence it received and many PBS themselves, the committee concluded that there were no major problems with the format of the documents and that the annual fine-tuning by Finance was helpful. With regard to the contents of the PBS, the committee noted certain problems with inconsistencies across portfolios in the level of detail contained and in the level of desegregation of the estimates. It also noted regular changes to program structures, which can have the effect of obscuring expenditure trends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having documented these and other problems, the committee has desisted from recommending any changes to the PBS for the final year before the move to accrual budgeting. That move, which the committee welcomes, will nevertheless cause a complete reworking of the documentation. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8422"> committee looks forward to working with the Department of Finance to ensure that the accrual budgeting PBS are as succinct, helpful and user-friendly as possible while continuing in their role as explanatory memoranda and accountability tool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be said that the estimates process has moved beyond the capacity of any document to act as a single briefing document. The PBS cannot and should not be expected, in the short time-frame and in the increasingly complex budgeting environment in which they are prepared, to say it all. We will all have to learn to accommodate an array of accountability documents, including annual reports, audit reports, evaluations, corporate plans. And moreover, we may need to specialise even more. In an attempt to assist senators in their handling of the estimates process, rather than bulking out the PBS, the committee encourages the use by legislation committees of pre-hearing factual briefings from portfolio officers. It also encourages Finance to hold workshops for senators and their staff and perhaps provide a telephone hotline for explanations of the budgeting conventions which so often cause misunderstandings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has agreed to report again on the format of the PBS under accrual budgeting. Both to assist it in this task and to provide some feedback to the compilers of the documents, the committee recommends that legislation committees, in their reports on the estimates, be required to comment on the format and the content of the PBS.</PARA>

The amendment that I propose on this occasion, as I said in the debate yesterday, addresses the situation that was the subject of yesterday's consideration. In saying that, I acknowledge that that is not the view of the Greens and I do not think it is the view of the Australian Democrats. However, it is the view of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will insert in clause 2 a new subclause (3) in place of the existing subclause (3) to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a public inquiry, sponsored by the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, has been held with respect to environmental issues arising 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8423"> out of the current pattern of water flows in rivers and streams, caused by the operation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and the Minister is satisfied with the adequacy of the conduct, outcome and planned implementation of the inquiry, having regard to the continuing viability of the Scheme . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That relates to the operation of this bill, and it would require that the minister is satisfied that all of the water studies that have been the subject of this debate have been properly completed and that the planned implementation has been properly executed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the nature of the amendment that I seek to insert. If it is carried, it will ensure that the Commonwealth government does not ignore the Snowy Mountains scheme once the legislation is passed. Under the amendment, the government will have to be satisfied with the adequacy, conduct, outcome and implementation of the results of the water inquiry. The bill, as it currently stands, is very limited in so far as the role of the Commonwealth in the establishment of the water inquiry is concerned, as the Commonwealth has in essence left this responsibility to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the Snowy River is a national icon and therefore deserves, at the very least, a national interest policy consideration by this government. The amendment that I have foreshadowed goes some way to ensuring that the government pays some attention to the national interest in regard to the Snowy. It is vital that the Commonwealth is satisfied with the national outcome, given that the various issues the water inquiry needs to look at include the Snowy's rehabilitation, the water distribution between electricity generation, irrigation and environmental interests, and the management of those issues for the future. They involve questions of balance and questions of national significance. Neither the government nor the parliament should cede its responsibilities until it is satisfied that an appropriate balance has been found in respect of the various issues concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy is a national infrastructure project, and at the very least it deserves the attention of the national government. We did debate this issue to so some extent yesterday, but they are the formal remarks I wish to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this amendment because it is a small step in the right direction. We certainly welcome the opportunity for the public to have some input. While I understand that was going to happen informally, there was no real requirement for it in this legislation. However, I want to stress that we do not believe this goes anywhere near far enough in terms of the role of this parliament. Ideally, we would have liked a wide ranging inquiry held, with the involvement of the New South Wales and Victorian governments, and then a full and open assessment by the parliament of the outcomes of that inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that, as far as this critical issue of water usage is concerned, this parliament should have maintained some contact, some thread by which it can continue an overseeing role.

Secondly, can the minister say which other river environments will be studied for assessment of the impact of allowing water to flow down the Snowy?

The water inquiry would, of course, be all&hyphen;encompassing. It would cover not only the upstream damming of the Snowy but also downstream at places like the Murrumbidgee and so on. As pointed out, if you have read the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, you will notice that, with the Snowy itself, there are a lot of competing interests. We heard this in the debate yesterday, particularly from Senator West, who was particularly concerned about things like salination and the continuing irrigation of the Griffith area. There are many competing interests, and environmental flows is certainly one of them. Other interests to be considered are water for irrigation for the Great Dividing Range, water to address salination and loss of

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no legislative requirements. What we have agreed to, and I mentioned this yesterday in the second reading, has occurred after a lot of debate. There was debate about whether the corporatisation would take place first and then they would do the inquiry. The comment was made, and I think quite correctly at the time, that without corporatisation there would be no inquiry. There were no requirements under the existing act and under the existing operation of the Snowy system for any environmental flows to take place at all. One of the arguments used in debate between the various jurisdictions was that without corporatisation there would be no addressing of any environmental flows on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8425"> Snowy. Out of that came a situation, which I think I said in the hearings before the committee was probably a better outcome, where the inquiry would take place, it would take six months, then there would be a two-month review or whatever time was required, but two months was the time frame, and that only following that would the legislation be proclaimed in the various jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go out of the past and into the future. I ask the minister whether an assessment of the cost of the environmental detriment&mdash;from here on in&mdash;of not having a natural flow in the Snowy will be made? Such an assessment should take into account the loss of the tourist amenity potential, fishing potential and agricultural and irrigation potential which results from the loss of the river's natural flow. It should also consider the loss of potential extending right down to the fisheries and the ocean changes at the mouth of the Snowy River, as well as the loss of the use of the river as far as the Aboriginal people are concerned and the loss of the amenity for people in townships like Orbost and Dalgety.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a couple of words on this point and I will not delay the Senate very long. The debate that we were just engaging in seems to focus on the environmental loss of the river flows because of damming of the Snowy Mountains scheme. As a matter of historic record&mdash;because this was a matter of some minor interchange in the chamber a moment ago&mdash;the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme was commissioned by the Chifley government but the opening of the scheme was handled by the Menzies government. The scheme was completed just as the Menzies government took power, so they opened the scheme. The reason why we have this very difficult management regime is that the Menzies government then gave the states of Victoria and New South Wales power to actually block any Commonwealth initiative about the management of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Snowy Mountains scheme, it is true that it was, in its day, one of the greatest civil engineering projects the world had seen and one that captured the imagination and admiration of Australians. It is an icon for that reason. It also attracted engineering praise from around the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His father was a contractor; I did not know that. The point is that the structure of the scheme is run down. It needs a capital injection. Victoria and New South Wales use the scheme as a backup generator to lift their load when the load on their grid system cannot be met by their normal power supplies. They just throw a switch and away it goes, lifting the power supply into their grid out of the Snowy in order to meet peak load demand. Victoria and New South Wales have an equal say with the Commonwealth govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8430"> ment, and every time someone has wanted to spend a bit of money to actually make the scheme more efficient, which will have environmental consequences, those states have resisted, through successive governments, an ability to upgrade the scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown has raised the question of the riverine system below the damming.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we are talking about environmental damage and since you have been asked to respond to a question about the environmental impact of the reduction of river flows, you might also wish to tell the Senate from an environmental point of view, given the power generated by the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority since 1949 and if that had been generated by coal&hyphen;fired power stations, what has been forgone in terms of greenhouse gas emissions? How much have we saved Australia in greenhouse gas emissions by generating our electricity by hydro and not by coal&hyphen;fired power stations? I do not expect you to know that off the top of your head; you may wish to take it on notice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I got up to respond briefly to Senator Brown&mdash;because I think we have canvassed this whole thing in the previous amendment and I do not want to keep going over it&mdash;I intended to say that it is an interesting observation. The Snowy is the biggest contributor of renewable energy, by a long shot, of anything else on the mainland of Australia.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a megawatt basis, you are talking about 3,000 megawatts. That is three times the size of the Gladstone power station and bigger than Eraring in New South Wales. I do not think Eraring is as big as that. So you are looking at millions of tonnes per year. Just by way of a rule of thumb, which I had calculated the other day, each tonne of coal generates about 2&half; tonnes of CO2. I think we are the most efficient in the world and I think we would be using about two million tonnes for a 1,000 megawatt power station. That gives you some idea. You can run the figures out. Often people are mistaken when they look at the renewable energy usage in Australia, which is of the order of seven or eight per cent or thereabouts. About 90&hyphen;odd per cent of that, or more, comes from the Snowy and the Tasmanian hydro&hyphen;electric systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the Democrats' amendment: the amendment states that the Commonwealth must not dispose of or transfer its shares in the Snowy hydro without the approval of the parliament. Essentially it is an attempt to prevent the Commonwealth from disposing of its 13 per cent holding in the company. It has only 13 per cent; Victoria has 29 per cent and New South Wales has 58 per cent. Certainly there have been overtures made&mdash;nothing has eventuated at this stage&mdash;for either New South Wales or Victoria to acquire the Commonwealth share in the Snowy. We are not a big player. What we are talking about in this bill is the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority. As Senator Lees has pointed out, Victoria and New South Wales have both stated that they may like to privatise their holdings in the company. I might add that it would be of limited value to us if that occurred to hold Snowy hydro shares if we retained 13 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are in any case, I believe, compelling reasons against a government, particularly this one, continuing its own electricity generation assets. The national electricity market is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8431"> increasingly competitive. Across the market, generators now bid against one another to supply electricity, which is of great benefit, I might say, to consumers, and wholesale purchasers to buy their electricity at prices set by the market. Spot wholesale prices have fallen almost 35 per cent, from $23 per megawatt hour to $15 per megawatt hour. This is below the cost of production of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The competitive market means there are significant risks in owning electricity generators, and generators who make wrong investment decisions will, of course, perform badly. I do not believe we should risk sums of taxpayers' money assets in this way and believe that governments have better things to do with their  money. I would like to ask the Senate to give us the flexibility to dispose of our Snowy hydro shares without further reference. I might say that the most likely outcome I can see at this stage&mdash;things may change&mdash;is that one or two of those states which have the bigger shareholdings may eventually take over the Commonwealth's 13 per cent in the Snowy.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is the opportunity lost by not having the natural flow of the Snowy River downstream of Jindabyne, and that cost must be paid by the Snowy Mountains scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That cost has to be paid because otherwise you have got this blinkered view that you use the cost of keeping environmental excellence as a reason for not doing anything about the environment, but you do not use the cost of not doing anything about the environment as an argument for restoring the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the reasons I gave when I talked about Senator Lees's amendment, as a general principle I support the privatisation. With the deregulation of the market that has been going on for quite some time and the subsequent fall that has occurred in the price of electricity, not the cost, there are now very substantial risks involved in a

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are quite right. I think about every nation on earth worked on the Snowy Mountains scheme. Basically, we are putting through corporatisation legislation to give us the flexibility to take it right through to the corporatisation stage. As you quite correctly said, it will not be proclaimed until after the water inquiry and until after the two states have reviewed it. When that occurs, we will have the proclamation. It gives us the flexibility to continue discussions, for example, with Victoria. I do not know whether New South Wales is interested; they may be. But it does give us that flexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment does not give us this flexibility. I think you quite correctly said that this would be a different kettle of fish if the Commonwealth owned the whole of the Snowy; it owns 13 per cent. We just need that certainty to be able to continue discussions, maybe discussions which are to the benefit of the Commonwealth&mdash;they would be; otherwise we would not pursue them&mdash;and, of course, subsequently, the taxpayers, to enable us to have that flexibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just on that point, Senator Harradine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has raised a good point at this stage. If we have a situation where New South Wales and Victoria have decided to privatise and we are still sitting there with our 13 per cent, surely that is a good bargaining chip to ensure that everything is sorted out. If we had legislation before us now in which the water allocations were clear and we knew exactly what was happening, the whole issue of corporatisation would have been dealt with differently as far as the Democrats are concerned; we would have treated that as a primary issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we let our shares go we have absolutely no bargaining chip in the future to make sure that all parties are considered, whether they are irrigators or small communities along the river with tourism interests in the river or whether they involve operators at the other end of the river in South Australia. We rely, as you know, incredibly heavily on that for water for Adelaide. If the Commonwealth gets rid of that 13 per cent before everything is sorted out, it loses its last bargaining chip.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is the first of two Bills whose purpose is to introduce a new method of calculating the safety net surcharge component of the customs and excise duty on certain tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 5 August 1997, the High Court held that the New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees were invalid. This decision also cast considerable doubt upon the constitutional validity of other State and Territory business franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and some petroleum products. In order to protect State and Territory revenues following this decision, the Commonwealth agreed to a safety net, part of which involved increases in customs and excise duties on certain tobacco products of $167 per kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time these increases were implemented, the Commonwealth Government was aware of the effect that changing from a value&hyphen;based franchise fee system to a weight based system would have on the tobacco industry. Following the High Court decision, the States and Territories held discussions with the industry and have agreed to a revised level of taxation and new arrangements for the levying of the surcharge. These arrangements will shift from a solely weighted based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. They will ensure that the effect of the safety net on the manufacturers of the different tobacco products is as close as possible to effect of the business franchise fees which applied prior to the High Court decision. All of the States and Territories have requested the Commonwealth to implement these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will introduce the new arrangements in relation to customs duty on tobacco products. Identical changes to the method of calculating excise duty on tobacco products are proposed in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the revenues collected under this Amendment Act and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 will continue to be returned to the States and Territories under the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994</EMPHASIS> . The States and Territories have also asked the Commonwealth the adjust the shares for tobacco products being returned to the States and Territories under that Act and these amendments are being made by the State Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is the second of two Bills whose purpose is to introduce a new method of calculating the safety net surcharge component of the customs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8438"> excise duty on certain tobacco products for the reasons sets out in my Second Reading Speech on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997. This Bill will introduce the new arrangements in relation to excise duty on tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives effect to a request by the states and territories to alter their shares of revenue replacement payments for tobacco under the safety net arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements were introduced at the states' request to protect their finances following the High Court decision of 5 August 1997 affecting state business franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the safety net, the Commonwealth uses its taxation power to collect, on the states' behalf, revenue that they previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. The revenues so collected are returned to the states (after the deduction of Commonwealth administrative costs) as revenue replacement payments under the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The distribution of revenue replacement payments among the states and territories is in accordance with shares agreed among them and set out in a Schedule to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states and territories have asked the Commonwealth to adjust the shares for tobacco related payments at the earliest opportunity as part of new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco under the safety net involving a lower revenue target and a shift from a weight based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. Separate bills have been introduced dealing with the revenue side of these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also seeks authority for any future changes in the distribution of tobacco, petroleum or alcohol revenues to be prescribed by regulation. This will provide flexibility should the review of the safety net arrangements, to be conducted within six months, give rise to further requests by the states to alter the existing shares. Any such change would be implemented only at the states' request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early passage of the bill will enable the Commonwealth to return tobacco collections to the states and territories on the basis of the new shares with minimum delay, assisting them to fund rebates for petroleum and alcohol&mdash;consistent with the objective of avoiding as far as possible price increases for these products.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill</XREF> . Yesterday I put on record the Democrats' opposition to this particular bill, which seeks a permanent exemption for Abstudy and Austudy from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. We do not believe that a permanent exemption is warranted or necessary. To that end, we have suggested that an exemption that lasts until 1 January 1999 would be more appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from explaining the reasons why we do not support the permanent exemption as requested by the government, I also put on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8439"> record yesterday and do so again the concern that the Democrats and others had at the fact that we received fairly late in the piece the report into this matter that was  requested in November 1996 by HREOC. It was a report on in principle marital discrimination under Austudy and Abstudy; a report that I would have thought was crucial to this debate; a report that is necessary as part of the decision making process on this bill. For that reason, I reiterate that it should have been tabled and made available in the other place before they made their decision to pass this particular bill. However, I thank the officers who made it available to us yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned yesterday the history of the exemption process and noted that I did not believe the former ALP government had dealt satisfactorily with this particular matter. When I was interrupted yesterday, I was talking about the various provisions that will exist under the common youth allowance which are designed to avoid rorting or abuse of the system, such as appropriate data matching and fraud checks. Those measures are already in place, so I argue that it is highly unlikely that these particular checks could not be readily applied to student assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy already assesses a de facto relationship. If an independent recipient enters a de facto relationship, the income and the assets of his or her partner are assessed. According to page 51 of the 1996 Austudy guide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are heavy penalties if you deliberately try to deceive Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are already penalties in place if you should try to deceive the department or the system, so I do not believe there would be an extra administrative burden for the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy has existing mechanisms for dealing with students who are independent and who are in de facto relationships. According to page 53 of the 1997 Austudy guide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the details you provide may be matched with other data held on DEETYA information systems, as well as other Government departments and agencies, education institutions, employers and financial institutions. These include the Department of Social Security . . . the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, as part of the common youth allowance proposals, the government announced that it would reduce the workplace requirements of Austudy independence to a total of 18 months over the previous two years. If a student can register as a job seeker and receive recognition of this as establishing their independence, why would a student bother to pursue some kind of sham de facto marriage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given all of these factors, the Democrats cannot understand why the government insists that the inclusion of de facto status will, as I believe Mr Tony Abbott stated, encourage young people to `shack up'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Kemp interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rod Kemp exclaims his distaste at this particular comment by the parliamentary secretary. It is not simply a matter of `shacking up'. You cannot `shack up', then fill in an Austudy form and then suddenly, miraculously and instantaneously be able to receive Austudy. There is a two-year period of living together in a partnership before you are able to get those entitlements&mdash;a partnership which can easily be disproved or proven by a check of the couple's financial, electoral and other arrangements. I listed those organisations through which data matching can take place. All of these are accessible and they are already accessed by the department. If we do not remove this discrimination, we may encourage young people not to shack up but encourage those in full-time study, or living independently or in a de facto relationship to drop out of full-time study. That is my worry. The belief that this measure will relieve the mischief of fraudulent and short-term relationships is false.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement made by the parliamentary secretary in the other place suggests that de jure married couples are less likely to have short-term or bogus relationships. It is precisely these assumptions that prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of marital status is aimed at stopping. So the Australian Democrats are strong supporters of the Sex Discrimination Act. We maintain that exemp 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8440"> tions to the SDA should be limited and that, where possible, all federal legislation should be consistent with the objectives of the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we have is that this issue, in relation to marital status and de facto status when it comes to student financial assistance, has been in both the former government and the current government's too-hard baskets for too long. It is now time to do something about this problem. The Labor government's attempts to ameliorate this situation by denying married students independence would leave it in a bit of an embarrassing situation today. But I trust that this time it will take the proper course of action and move to eradicate the discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be supporting attempts to allow an exemption for three years, as has been suggested by the Labor Party. As I say, we have put up an amendment that suggests that 1 January 1999 is appropriate. It forces the government to do something about this issue and it takes into account the operations of the reforms under the common youth allowance arrangements. I understand that they are purported to start from July next year, but we are allowing an additional six months in the amendment in case of any difficulties with the time and the starting arrangements of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to clarification from the minister as to what happens to the issue of de facto couples, independents and married couples under the CYA arrangements. My understanding is that this will partly resolve the situation that we have before us today. As I said yesterday, if that is the case, we commend the government. I certainly hope it is the case. I look forward to further enlightenment from the minister on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997</XREF>  will create a permanent exemption for Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Student assistance schemes have been through a series of administrative and legislative Sex Discrimination Act exemptions since 1984. Most of them have been inadequate, including the last, considered by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this chamber in 1995, when the ALP government attempted to exclude married couples under 22 years of age from the independent rate of Austudy. Obviously that would have been a ridiculous situation. The Greens will remain in favour, as we did in 1995, of Austudy being exempt from the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act in order for married couples to receive the independent rate of Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While governments insist that young adults should remain dependent on their parents for education long after the age at which they can vote, drink, marry or&mdash;God forbid&mdash;fight in a war, there is little other choice. However, we do not believe that granting a permanent exemption for all marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act is either necessary or an adequate way to deal with the complex marital issues associated with student assistance. In particular, the issue of de facto relationships remains one which governments fail to address and is simply glossed over with the introduction of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the government's belated and cursory report on this issue&mdash;a report which we received less than 24 hours ago, and may not have received at all without the pressure put on by the minor parties and I assume Labor on this issue&mdash;the government claims there would be `significant cost implications' if the de facto relationships were recognised in line with the Sex Discrimination Act. But where are the figures? Where is the evidence that this would be the case? If people are going to go to the considerable effort of concocting a marriage type relationship, what does this tell you about the willingness of their parents to support them? None of these issues is addressed in the government's report, and they never will be addressed if this bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When is a de facto relationship not a de facto relationship? This is a question that successive governments seem to have considerable difficulty answering, at least in any consistent manner. According to the Sex Discrimination Act, you are in a de facto relationship as soon as you live with someone as the husband or wife of that person on a bona fide domestic basis, although not legally married to that person. If you are in receipt of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8441"> unemployment or pension benefits, you are in a de facto relationship as soon as you are in a marriage like relationship with someone of the opposite sex. If you receive Abstudy, you are deemed to be in a de facto relationship when you have lived with someone of the opposite sex for six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provisions of the common youth allowance, you will be in a de facto relationship if you have been living with someone of the opposite sex for two years continuously in a marriage like relationship. If you are in receipt of Austudy, you will never be in a de facto relationship, because the Commonwealth government considers that you and your partner are too difficult to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report was specifically requested by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner as a prerequisite for granting the administrative exemption for 1997. The government has hastily thrown together 10 pages of excuses for doing nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of the exemption granted by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner suggest that this exemption was granted by the commission with the bona fide intention of achieving an equitable and non-discriminatory solution to the problem of Austudy or Abstudy discrimination. The government agreed to this intention, but I would contend that it has failed miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is being enacted not out of any clear policy position but, rather, as an easy out to cover the government's inaction on this issue. It is not as though this is a new issue or that government members have not stated their position on the matter, as can be seen from the following extract of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 February 1995. On page 826, Senator Tierney, then an opposition senator, berated the Labor government for not coming up with a method to address the discrimination against de facto couples in relation to Austudy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government was lazy and arrogant in not tackling this problem of definition. It could have decided on a fair and workable definition for genuine student de facto relationships. This would have removed the need to discriminate against any group.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And later:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is all this hurt and uncertainty for young married students because the Labor government could not find, with the help of its vast bureaucracy, a simple definition for de facto relationships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One year on, it appears that the Liberal government has been just as neglectful. It has had nearly a year to address this issue&mdash;and here we are, in the second-last sitting week, having sighted the promised report less than 24 hours ago, and the best the government can come up with is a blanket exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act marital status provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevant formal documents tabled with this bill state that it is government policy that `exemptions to the Sex Discrimination Act should be limited' and that, `where possible, all federal legislation should be consistent with the Sex Discrimination Act's objectives'. This is an important policy statement from the government. Unfortunately, the bill does not reflect this position and, for the most part, the bill merely reflects the status quo. It takes absolutely no steps to reduce discriminatory assumptions within the specified legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position on the de facto issue is quite difficult to fathom. On the one hand, it claimed during the second reading debate that it was too administratively complex to equate de facto couples with married couples due to issues of proof; and, as has been mentioned, we had Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, claiming that it was improper for the government to be encouraging young people to `shack up'. But, on the other hand, it intends to enact a common youth allowance which will recognise de facto relationships. So, obviously, it is not all that difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also seems to have forgotten that, from 1976 to 1982, during the term of a Liberal government, a de facto relationship provision existed under the Student Assistance Act. Gosh, it must not have been difficult then. The government certainly does not have a problem with it in terms of Abstudy either, where students are granted independence after establishing the existence of a de facto relationship, in this case, for six months. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8442">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like figures and research on the claimed cost implications and administrative difficulties of recognising de facto relationships, not the anecdotal guesswork that has accompanied this debate and which dominates the government's so-called report. For example, it might be appropriate to trial granting de facto relationships the same independent status as marriages. Surely, in an era where up to 25 per cent of long-term relationships are out of wedlock, this is an issue that deserves serious attention&mdash;not just `we reckon it'll cost too much'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government report cites the second key area of the necessity for discrimination&mdash;the first being de facto relationships&mdash;as the need for a spouse means test. Yet nowhere in the report is it mentioned that forcing a person, especially a woman, to be completely financially dependent on their partner can be detrimental to that person's self-esteem, freedom of choice and access to education. It is well documented that mature age women students, in returning to education, often face resistance from their partners. Surely these are major issues that one would hope a report of this nature would canvass. Nothing whatsoever. All it talks about is the need to make cost savings in the context of targeting payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights a `more minor' area of discrimination in which single students over the age of 21 who have been long-term unemployed are eligible for a higher rate of Austudy, but similar students with a spouse are not. In this case, the government has not explained its rationale for this arrangement at all, let alone canvassed any social justice or equity arguments. This report, to say the least, is inadequate. The government's lack of action in this area is reprehensible, and it needs to go and do it again; try it over again, and go back to the drawing board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also claim that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner will no longer grant administrative exemptions and, therefore, this legislation must be passed by the end of this year in order to prevent an administrative mess occurring with regard to Austudy claims. This may or may not be the case; we do not know. Certainly, the commis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sioner would be justified in being tired of this government's inaction on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if the government is serious about addressing this issue, and if it has got itself into a mess via its incompetence or misfortune, or whatever other excuse it may come up with, it would seem that surely at the very least the government should only legislate for an exemption with a sunset clause that expires before the introduction of the common youth allowance due to be implemented in July 1998 but which, in the interests of fairness, should probably be introduced at the start of 1999. This would enable the exemption to be viewed in relation to what could be a substantially amended common youth allowance with various possible implications for sex discrimination issues; also, it would enable the government to consult with the community in a meaningful manner to address this issue once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Liberal and Labor governments have placed this issue in the too&hyphen;hard basket for far too long. We will not support a bill that enables the government to avoid this issue indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP have proposed an amendment to place a three-year sunset clause on the bill. Apparently, this has been moved to allow a more rigorous review on the issue. I would suggest that allowing three years to conduct a review will achieve nothing but inaction for about two years and nine months, and then perhaps another report like we have today. Surely, we should be insisting that this issue deserves to be addressed with certainty and equity, as quickly as possible. It is not as if people have not had enough time to think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sex Discrimination Commissioner does not want to deal with the issue any more. Why should we allow up to three years for this issue to drag on? The Greens will be moving amendments in relation to recognition of same sex couples and the de facto relationships in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are effectively two Greens (WA) associated amendments, one of which would say that, while marital status can be considered so that married people are granted the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8443"> independent rate, `married' must include both de jure and de facto marriage. This would mean that the independent status would be extended to de facto couples and would recognise that de facto marriage is increasingly common, particularly among young people such as students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tax law, social security, the treatment of matters concerning children, family law and nearly every form of law in Australia, other than the Marriage Act, de facto relationships are seen as virtually indistinguishable from de jure marriage. I see no reason to try to create economic incentives to try to push young, usually childless, couples into marriage. The other amendment, in line with work I have done previously, would eliminate the discrimination between same sex and opposite sex de facto couples.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is another relatively simple amendment which would give recognition to the existence of same&hyphen;sex couples. The current definition of de facto spouse states:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">My amendment changes the definition of `de facto spouse' so that the term `as a husband or wife' is replaced with `in a marriage&hyphen;like relationship'. I had to do that because the courts insist that the use of the phrase `as the husband or wife of that person' when they are not legally married implies that this can only refer to members of the opposite sex. In other words, same&hyphen;sex couples are excluded yet again from any recognition which is happily given to de facto couples of the opposite sex. In case this is not enough, I have included `regardless of whether people are of the same 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or opposite sex'. Those are the only changes I have made to the current definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not because same&hyphen;sex couples do not exist. I think even Fred Nile would admit that they do. It is not that same&hyphen;sex couples do not have deep and abiding commitments to one another. After all, there is no requirement that opposite sex couples in de facto relationships have any commitments to one another other than those involved in the definition of a bona fide domestic relationship. Yet even if a same&hyphen;sex couple make vows to one another, legally and financially merge their affairs, and clearly have far more commitment than the average de facto couple, they cannot have their relationship recognised legally. This is simple discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak for a moment on Senator Harradine's concern about preserving the institution or sanctity of marriage. In the first place, this is not what law does. What law does through the Marriage Act is to outlaw the recognition of same&hyphen;sex marriage. It means that, even where there are churches such as the Metropolitan Church or the Quakers who will marry same&hyphen;sex partners in love and for life before God and the community, that sanctified union is legally forbidden the grant of legal recognition as marriage. The Uniting Church has said that ministers can conduct ceremonies that acknowledge same&hyphen;sex relationships but they are not marriages. Anglican Bishop Baker has openly called for recognition and marriage of same&hyphen;sex couples. There are also various non&hyphen;Christian religions that recognise and sanctify same&hyphen;sex relationships, religions such as the Unitarians, Buddhists and so on. There are, further, many same&hyphen;sex couples who make vows of union in a civil ceremony presided over by civil celebrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these can legally be classed as marriage. We are denying love, denying commitment and denying the view of marriage in some religions, and we are denying reality if we say that such commitment does not exist. The fact is that same&hyphen;sex couples do exist. Same&hyphen;sex families exist and have children. It is both foolish and socially counterproductive to deny any recognition and support of commitment within such relation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8448"> ships. We deny these people the opportunity to legally marry. They may morally, socially, materially and emotionally marry, but we deny any legal recognition. We are then potentially so mean&hyphen;minded that we deny such unions, including those sanctified in churches and by religion, the same legal status we give to any two people who live together for a few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We deny same&hyphen;sex people who effectively married with vows and commitments even the status of de facto. We grant de facto status to any opposite sex couple that live together under tax law, in social security, in employment, in superannuation, in life insurance and in aged care&mdash;in virtually all aspects of society where law rules. We deny that to people who, were there no legal boundary explicitly preventing it, would otherwise be recognised as married. We deny it to people who have lived together for 30 or 40 years, raised children together and bought houses together. It is not preservation of family; it is denial of it. It is not recognition of love and vows; it is denial of that. Under social security laws, we will force de facto status on unwilling heterosexuals. Under the same law we will not grant legal recognition even as de factos to a same&hyphen;sex couple even if they ask for such recognition. We are denying family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne gave qualified recognition for committed same&hyphen;sex relationships. He argued that there were ways and degrees by which God's ideals could be expressed, even if not expressed fully in the eyes of the church. He said that the couple, be they homosexual or heterosexual, who are living together in a committed relationship are coming closer to that ideal than those without such commitments. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, in their submission to the sexuality bill&mdash;even the Catholic bishops&mdash;recognised the injustice, inhumanity and unchristianness of this sort of discrimination.

<PARA STYLE="Para">And at point 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, the sexuality discrimination bill concerning same&hyphen;sex couples is notable for its attempt to confer rights, albeit limited, on same&hyphen;sex couples. To the degree that it can provide protection from unjust discrimination and that it provides protection against discrimination similar to those accorded to persons living in a de facto relationship, it is hardly objectionable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Catholic bishops have asked for recognition as de facto relationships of same&hyphen;sex couples. How on earth can we, the Senate, continue with the pretext that this type of discrimination is acceptable? I am not asking for the recognition of same&hyphen;sex marriage. I recognise that this is a hurdle many people would not jump. What I am asking for is what the Catholic bishops declared was the just course, that is, legal recognition of same&hyphen;sex couples as being in de facto relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of denying this and continuing homophobic discrimination are to deny people's rights, such as the ability to visit a partner in hospital after an accident, because there is no legal relationship. It is to deny a person the right to name a partner of decades as the recipient of superannuation in the event of death. It is to deny people the right to leave for familial duties when a partner becomes gravely ill. It is to deny two people who have lived together for decades, who have made vows to one another and have had them religiously sanctified, the rights you would thrust on a couple of teenagers living together with no intention of continuing to live together beyond what is fun and convenient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard a number of objections to similar amendments here. Senator Faulkner has claimed that heterosexual couples are treated so badly that same&hyphen;sex couples should be glad to live with systematic discrimination in all aspects of their lives rather than be treated the same way. We have heard the argument put by the ALP that, if we stopped treating some people in our society in a clearly discriminatory way, a way which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8449"> violates their rights, it may have unforeseen revenue implications. In other words, we cannot stop discrimination because the oppressed group might get something from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the argument that this is no good because it is a piecemeal or ad hoc approach. Yet there is no intention shown or effort being made in this place for an integrated approach. The sexuality bill put forward by former senator Sid Spindler of the Democrats is the closest thing we have to an integrated approach. The report of the committee examining that bill has been delayed and delayed and is currently scheduled for the last day of this sitting session. So, if we get to reports on that day&mdash;and I will believe it when I see it&mdash;we can rest assured that any treatment given the issue will be minimal and generally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call the date of the report a cynical exercise. This place and the two major parties in it have no intention of working on an integrated approach to ending this discrimination. In any case, even if the  Sexuality Discrimination Bill  were miraculously given debate and passed, we would still have to amend the many bills, one by one, to remove discriminatory clauses such as the one I am hoping to change here. We can simply change legislation as it arises, and it is actually not that difficult. The change to this bill will hopefully affect students on Austudy and Abstudy. We allow discrimination in granting married students special rights; we deny same sex couples the right to marry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment would grant recognition to de facto students. This amendment would, in conjunction with that, allow same sex couples&mdash;who are adult in most legal senses and who, because of their orientation, may be abandoned and rejected by parents&mdash;some option for recognition as independent. But, even if my second amendment is not passed, this amendment will have a beneficial effect because it changes the definition of `de facto' in the Sex Discrimination Act. It will allow recognition of same sex couples under that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One result of this is that, in areas of employment where discrimination on the basis of marital status is not allowed, this would also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prohibit discrimination on the basis of a definition of `de facto' that included same sex couples. It will therefore have an effect of allowing action to be taken in relation to discrimination in employment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the Senate to put aside its excuses and prevarication and to end the discrimination and grant legal recognition of same sex unions as being at least equivalent to the de facto status. I commend my amendments to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be supporting the Greens (WA) amendments. While we have some sympathy with the position that Senator Margetts has outlined in regard to the philosophical argument on the issues of discrimination against same sex, as against opposite sex, couples&mdash;and I do note the length to which Senator Margetts goes to quote supporting church evidence&mdash;I have always found this a particularly interesting line of argument on these questions when bishops and various other hierarchies are quoted on questions of discrimination, and I am sure it is a sympathy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8450"> that they would appreciate only too well, given that these issues have been given such public attention. The problem for us, however, as people actually genuinely concerned not only with the theoretical issues of discrimination, is the practical effect of what is being proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to Senator Margetts, as a person who regards herself as a socialist, that that would be a matter of great concern to her. I would have thought the issue of the impact of such a proposal on the finances of low income, same sex couples&mdash;the loss of perhaps as much as $115 a fortnight if this proposition were to be carried&mdash;would have been given some prominence in the appeal that has just been put to the Senate because I think we should understand the full implications of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have clearly a difference here between sympathy for a philosophical statement and our real concerns about the practical effects such a proposal would have. It is our view that this proposal, if it were actually carried by the parliament, would allow this government, which is notorious for its attacks upon people on low incomes&mdash;people who are dependent on social security and people who are dependent on student assistance&mdash;to hop into people in a way that we have never seen before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would see that millions of dollars would be lost by people who were actually enjoying the benefits of Austudy or other social security benefits. I ask the Greens to please advise the Senate how they can be so sure that this is a position that same sex couples would in fact support. I think it would be appropriate to get some evidence that same sex couples would be volunteering to lose income of this order when, by definition, to get this money they are low income persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a wonderful thing to have a commitment to an abstract principle but, when it comes to actually assisting people on low incomes, we have to be aware of the very practical implications of such proposals. If the Greens expect the chamber to support such a proposition, I would ask them to at least provide us with the evidence to support the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conclusions that they are reaching. I presume they are arguing that this is in response to the demands that are being made by low income people on social security benefits or student assistance benefits, and that same sex couples are actually asking for this to be done so that they can in fact lose up to $115 a fortnight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to be in a position to report progress on the reference. The chairman's draft report was circulated to committee members last week and the committee had its initial deliberation on the content of the report today. I am obviously not going to say anything further about the content of the report, either here or in any other place, because I know the possible consequences of that. The committee has a reporting date of `by the last sitting day of the year'. It may be possible, and it is a matter which is in the control of the committee, that a report could be adopted earlier.

I assume that he was referring to the income and assets testing arrangements that may apply to registered and recognised couples. I think he is nodding. So I put to the minister and his advisers: is it not the case that it was the former ALP government that in fact lowered the threshold at which those assets and income testing arrangements for married and recognised couples kicked in? As I recall, back in 1991 or thereabouts we saw the threshold lowered from around $18,000 per annum to around $12,000 per annum. I am not sure if my memory serves me correctly. It should be noted, however, that couples who were recognised and able to access student financial assistance in the form of Austudy had incurred some financial loss as a consequence of the former government's changes to the threshold and the testing arrangements. I ask the minister whether that is correct.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the opposition supports the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> , but I wish to make a few brief comments on it. I was tempted to put forward an amendment to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8455"> title of the bill to add an `s' to the word `demand' so it would read `Sydney airport demands management'. It is quite clear that this government has failed in its management of aviation issues generally and in its management of the operations of Sydney airport and the need for a second Sydney airport in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation arises out of the initiative of the Labor Party and, in particular, the member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, whose electorate has long suffered the problems of aircraft noise. Mr Albanese put forward a private member's bill to impose a cap on Sydney airport; something that the government has talked about and something that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when he was Leader of the Opposition, made a lot of noise about it but was only prepared to act on once prompted by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation places a cap of 80 movements per hour on the operations of Kingsford Smith airport, subject to certain exemptions which relate to emergencies and military needs. Other aspects of the legislation relate to the establishment of a framework for slot management. As I said earlier, one has to be very sceptical about this government's real ability to bring about a more adequate system of aircraft management at Sydney airport and in Sydney generally. We are happy to support the legislation, but we are awaiting the regulations to come forward in regard to the detail of that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Senate that this government has failed absolutely in their handling of the ever increasing important issues of airports and aircraft noise, and aviation management in this country. We had the farcical situation where, not long after they were elected last year, they proposed that Sydney's second airport could be located at Holsworthy&mdash;something that was rejected as totally unsuitable many years earlier. This proposal caused great outrage and unnecessary anxiety in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition told the government that it was a stupid proposal and that it would never succeed once the EIS process was implemented. In fact, they did not even complete the EIS report. After having wasted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> around $13 million of taxpayers' money on an EIS into Holsworthy, the minister was forced to announce that Holsworthy had been taken off the agenda as a site for Sydney's second airport. That decision was announced even before the EIS was completed. This government has been going backwards in relation to fixing up the long-term problems of Sydney's airport needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of air safety in this country, an issue which everyone is aware of, is basically in a shambles at the moment. The former minister, Mr Sharp, who recently resigned, attempted to interfere in the management and structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The previous chairman, Justice Fisher, and the executive director have resigned, largely because of the machinations of the minister in seeking to bring about a restructuring of the board. The minister previously appointed people to the board who were clearly there to do his bidding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not continue with those issues at this time, because much has been said and much will be said in the future as the issues drag on. Notwithstanding this government's failures, we welcome this legislation and we are happy to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

We will, however, be moving an amendment to the bill in the committee stage. On behalf of Senator Bourne, I seek leave to incorporate our speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we know, the purpose of this Bill is to establish a maximum limit on the number of aircraft movements at 80 per hour, during non-curfew hours, at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also establishes an aircraft movement management system, to be known as a Slot Management System, to administer these movements. The Slot Management System will be overseen by a Compliance System, over seen by a committee. Airservices Australia may have membership on the Management committee, and will play a vital role in the compliance of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices Australia will also be required to report to the Minister on a quarterly basis on the operation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8456"> of the System. In turn, the Minister will be required to table this report, and its recommendations, in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Australian Democrats support the Bill in concept and rationale&mdash;the notion of ordered queuing makes sense. However, we do not support the maximum number of aircraft movements. This Bill proscribes a maximum number of 80 movements per hour, which the Democrats believe is just too high.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, I have tabled an amendment to this Bill, to provide that the maximum number of aircraft movements at Sydney Airport be no more than 70 movements per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to see how a limit of 80 movements per hour&mdash;as outlined in the Coalition's pre-election policy&mdash;will help residents, when this level is higher than the current number of maximum movements per peak hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have been strong advocates for both an extended curfew for Sydney Airport, and for the limitation of aircraft movements. In my own Private Senator's Bill in 1995, the number of movements at Sydney Airport were capped at 60. The opening of the East West Runway&mdash;another decision the Democrats opposed&mdash;saw the number of aircraft movements into Sydney increase. Indications are that there will be a steady increase in the level of air traffic using Sydney, especially when the decision about the second airport seems so far from being made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If increases continue to occur at Sydney Airport, tolerating aircraft noise for many people living close to the airport and under its flightpaths, already very difficult, will become unbearable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase in usage of Sydney airport has seen the Coalition Government and the Labor Opposition call for a capping of 80 movements per hour&mdash;an increase of at least five movements per hour in peak time. It is almost as if, in drafting the bill, the government has used the fact that Sydney Airport already experiences peak hour movements in the mid-seventies, and that a mere increase to 80 movements will be negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have constituents across all the areas of Sydney affected by the airport, who would not agree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Bill does allow the Minister to lower the number of aircraft movements per hour after community consultation. And this is to be applauded. The Democrats believe this is a commendable inclusion. And, when residents complain, about an increase in aircraft movements to 80, we hope the Minister will take notice. The Minister will be wise to remember that airlines and businesses are not the only groups affected by this decision. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase in movements will have a devastating effect of the lives of those residents most affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a secondary effect of capping aircraft movements to 80. The effect will be to extend the peak hour periods, as flights will be pushed out from these busiest periods, meaning there will be a stream of movements over a longer period of time. I note that the Labor party believes this is worth the trade-off to ensure a legislative capping of aircraft movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each aircraft user of the airport will be given a specific time within a specific hour, on a specified day, in which they can use Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Plan will be developed by the aviation industry and submitted to the Minister for approval. This Bill does not provide details on the way the Slot System might operate, although its idea is to provide a consistent approach to demand for all airport users. Two objectives of the Slot System are to provide equitable access for regional airlines, and for new entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope this will be the case. There may be other issues impacting upon the development of the Slot Management System. It might be argued that congestion at Sydney Airport is only problematic at peak times. If congestion was the determining factor, then it certainly has not effected the efficiency of the operation of Heathrow Airport, for example, which has had a long problem with congestion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the Slot Management System could incorporate `aircraft-free days' to each of the areas most affected by aircraft noise, and that the Slot Manager informs those communities of the days set aside for their particular area. The ability to plan recreational activities, school exam days, weddings, and so on, and to know that these activities can be undertaken without the impediment of aircraft noise, will help alleviate some of the distress suffered by noise-affected residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other feature the Democrats would like to see incorporated into the Slot Management System, is a fairer sharing of the patterns of take-offs and landings. This has a lot to do with the distribution of noise. Take-offs involve more noise&mdash;a lot more noise in some cases. Take-offs can be more flexible in where they can head, whereas landings must approach the airport both straight and low. There is also a greater difference in terms of aircraft type&mdash;767s, 747s, 737s and the smaller commuter jets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These, for the purposes of this Bill are all defined as aircraft movements. The Democrats expect these issues will be taken into due consideration by the Slot Manager in the drafting of the Slot Management System. The day to day operations of the Slot Management System will be undertaken by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8457"> aviation industry, with the Department of Transport involved at the level of the Co-ordination Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Air Traffic Controllers will be involved as members of the Compliance Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Compliance Committee will be empowered to fine airlines which do not comply with the system. Fines can be up to $220,000, depending on the type of breach. Hopefully, too, the system will allow a clearer and closer scrutiny of the reasons for long delays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also not clear whether the monies collected will be returned to the Slot Management System for administration of the system, or for the establishment of an appeals process. The Democrats believe that at least a proportion of those monies ought to be used for the purposes of funding community projects related to the airport issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Or, perhaps the Minister and the Slot Manager could consider channelling that money back into the Sydney Noise Insulation Project, to provide relief for all those residents under the flight path.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a couple of other points I wish to make in regard to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, following the Senate inquiry report "Falling on Deaf Ears" I tabled a Private Senator's Bill which provided a capping on the number of movements at Sydney Airport (at 55 movements per hour, and then amended the Bill to extend this figure to 60). The Bill also contained provision for the extension of the curfew, and for the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry for environmental and noise related issues to be reported to the Parliament if the number of movements was to be extended. I received no support from either of the major parties for that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it quite interesting therefore, that in his second reading speech, the shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Tanner believes this Bill is long overdue, and that the `Albanese Bill', introduced by Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, to provide a capping of 80 movements per hour, "should have been allowed to be implemented and be passed through this parliament when it was introduced rather than sitting around for months".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, these outcomes could have been achieved over two years ago, with greater safeguards for all Sydney residents, by passing the Democrats Private Senator's Bill upon which Mr Albanese's Bill was based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also find it quite extraordinary that this Government still has not made a decision on the location of Sydney's second airport site. We can all so easily recall the debates over the sites, and the continual EIS studies which have cost an enormous amount of money. At least the Government have made their mind up about Holsworthy. But the fact 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remains that there still, in late 1997, has been no decision on the site of the second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "Falling on Deaf Ears" report found that the capacity of Sydney Airport will be reached within the next few years. The Olympics will be a catalyst for increasing pressures to further extend the capacity of the Airport, remove the curfew, or increase the number of hourly movements. And the longer it takes to develop the second airport, the greater this pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These things cannot be allowed to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope, for the residents of New South Wales, and for the users of the facilities at Sydney Airport, that the Slot Management (and its compliance) System and the guarantee of 80 movements per hour will create a better Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also expect that the capping of 80 movements per hour does not mean that we will actually get 80 aircraft movements every hour of the airport's operation, but that 80 aircraft movements will be the maximum in peak times only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets the framework for the operation of the Slot Management System only. We will have to wait for the details of the Slot Management System and its Compliance System to be developed by the aviation industry and the department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens do not support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> . The bill sets the maximum hourly movement rate of Kingsford Smith airport at 80 movements an hour. The bill has been strongly endorsed by other components of the Senate, but I want to place on record some facts which challenge that support. It is a fallacy that a cap of 80 movements an hour will stop the growth of the airport. Inner city politicians, such as the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), even express the expectation that the number of movements through the airport will decline because of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the new Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Mark Vaile, said in his speech to the bill that `80 movements an hour equates to approximately half a million movements per year'. That is half a million flights through the airport per year. These are words designed to allay any fears the air transport lobby might have that the cap will impede the growth of the airport.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8458">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the annual number of movements is about 270,000. By the minister's own admission, this so&hyphen;called cap will allow the number of movements to, in effect, double. The cap of 80 movements per hour is a clayton's cap. It is the cap you have when you are not having a cap at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is misnamed. What is proposed here is not demand management; it is traffic management. For reasons I will explain in a moment, the maximum hourly movement rate should certainly not be set at more than 70 movements. This could be achieved quite easily through real demand management, such as requiring the airlines to reorganise their routes so that Kingsford Smith was no longer used as the main hub in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, some 27 per cent of all air passenger movements at Kingsford Smith are attributable to people who are in transit or transfer. In other words, they never leave the airport in surface transport. They fly in, change planes or wait while other passengers join their flight and then fly out. That hubbing role does not have to be done at Kingsford Smith. If it were done by another airport, the maximum hourly movement rate could be held at 70 movements per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One reason the cap should be set at no more than 70 movements is that the noise sharing component of the long&hyphen;term operating plan will not work at levels much above that. When it is handling high volumes of traffic, the airport must employ the parallel runways and not use the east&hyphen;west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Warner, the chair of Sydney's Air Traffic Management Task Force&mdash;the body that designed the long&hyphen;term operating plan&mdash;has said that noise sharing modes will not be possible at movement rates of 73 or more an hour, or even at 64 an hour if certain taxiway improvements are not made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the airport is regularly operating for several hours a day at movement rates of more than 73, when it must use the north&hyphen;south parallel runways, people north of the airport and at Kurnell in the south will have exposure to noise and air pollution worse than they had before the east&hyphen;west runway was re&hyphen;opened. The proposed cap of 80 is too dangerous. The maximum hourly movement rate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be set as low as possible to reduce the risk of aircraft crashing. Eighty movements an hour is an enormous stress on air traffic controllers and pilots and exposes hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents to unacceptable risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, long before the third runway became operational, it was estimated that for people living near the airport under the northern flight path the risk of being killed by an aircraft crash was 40 chances per million per year. Compare this with the risk of a pedestrian being killed by a motor vehicle, which is about 35 chances per million per year. In other words, there was more chance of being killed by a plane crash than being killed by a motor vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in 1989 when aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith were at about 200,000 per year. Today there are 270,000 and the number is growing at an incredible rate which, if unconstrained, could see the level at 400,000 by the year 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fatality risk for people living under the flight paths is already too high. It is terrifying to think what it will be in the future, but we have no figures on that because, to his everlasting shame, the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, has refused an EIS on the long&hyphen;term operating plan. No doubt one reason he refused an EIS was that it would have made forecasts about the level of risk people will be exposed to as the air traffic increases, and the government does not want the people to know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kingsford Smith sits cheek by jowl with many hazardous installations and storage facilities, including several oil terminals, the ICI complex and other petrochemical and chemical industries. The area adjacent to the airport is the major chemical and petrochemical industrial complex in New South Wales. The southern approach path brings planes in over the Kurnell refinery which is the largest in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might think it is worth investigating the wisdom of intensifying the use of an airport so close to so many dangerous installations. This government, like the government before it, has shirked that responsibility. The two parallel runways are only 1,050 metres 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8459"> apart. By international standards, that is very small for independent operations of large aircraft. To achieve the rate of 80 movements an hour on these closely spaced runways&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FORSHAW" NAMEID="656">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator Forshaw</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They're medium spaced.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw might reassure residents by saying that they are medium spaced, but I maintain that they are closely spaced. New and relatively untried radar technology must be used; whether they be medium or closely spaced, that is a requirement. This technology does not have a long and distinguished track record. It is only a couple of years old and is installed in only two airports in the world, one of them being Kingsford Smith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are taking risks with this airport, and they are big risks. Several air transport organisations such as the International Air Transport Association and the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, have predicted that by the year 2010 there will be a major air crash somewhere in the world, once a week&mdash;52 a year. There is no reason to think that Kingsford Smith will be immune from that trend, especially given the narrow separation of its runways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pilots are expected to follow complex arrival and departure procedures and already the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has reported that domestic and international pilots often have problems following air traffic controllers' instructions. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 20 February last and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Aviation</EMPHASIS> magazine of July 1997 reported the bureau's findings that pilots frequently failed to comply with air traffic control directives. Many such incidents involve large commercial jets at this airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the mistakes at Kingsford Smith have been publicised. At 2.40 p.m. on 10 October 1995, when traffic levels were, luckily, very low, a fully laden Qantas 737 from Auckland landed on the wrong runway. In January this year an Ansett A320 failed to obey the instruction to veer left as it took off, and came close to the path of an incoming Japan Airlines 747.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kingsford Smith is not immune to the prospect of accidents. In recent years there have been several serious accidents in the approach to and departures from the airport. In April 1994 a DC3 crashed into Botany Bay when taking off. In April 1995 an engine cowling fell from a Philippine Airlines jet shortly after take off. In both instances it was pure luck that the take offs were to the south and no&hyphen;one was killed. In January 1994 the pilot and sole occupant of an AeroCommander turboprop cargo plane was killed when it crashed off Cronulla as he was preparing to land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exponential growth of air traffic at the airport, the congested and complicated arrival and departure streams, and the ever decreasing safety margins as new technology is employed to increase capacity rather than to improve safety, all bode ill for passengers and residents alike. About 60 per cent of fatal crashes occur during approach and landing&mdash;that is worldwide. About 25 per cent of fatal crashes occurred during take off. It does not make sense to have approach and departure paths over a densely populated area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the myth that an airport at Badgerys Creek is the solution to the airport problem in inner Sydney. Badgerys Creek is a confidence trick on the people of inner Sydney. If it is built, it will do nothing to alleviate their problems and, in all likelihood, will actually make the situation worse. In two airport systems all over the world the role of the second airport is to enable the main airport to operate more efficiently. In other words, Badgerys Creek will take smaller aircraft from Kingsford Smith, freeing up capacity to accept more large jets. It will also take the overflow of jets during peak hour so that Kingsford Smith will operate in the most efficient and cost effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated in the original second airport EIS at page 57 and repeated in the third runway draft EIS at pages 5 to 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second airport augments the capacity of a primary airport by catering for peaks in traffic . . . when there is only one (airport). It must necessarily be under&hyphen;utilized a great deal if it is sized to handle the peak. Where there are two facilities, one handling the peak and the other the baseload, the utilization of the primary airport can become very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8460"> high. Indeed, the secondary airport makes it possible for the primary airport to be fully utilized most of the time, operating at a maximum capacity during most of the hours it is open.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You have only to consider the airports in London to see that a second airport does nothing to ease the problem of the first airport. Heathrow is still growing, even though it has a second airport, Gatwick. London now even has a third and fourth airport, but Heathrow continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Badgerys Creek is not the obvious solution, why has there been such Messianic support for it over the years from inner Sydney Labor politicians and more recently from inner Sydney Liberals? The answer is that they have nothing else to offer&mdash;within the limited parameters that they are prepared to consider this matter, the only hope they offer their constituents is the false hope of Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not prepared to consider downgrading Kingsford Smith, nor even genuinely limiting its growth. Badgerys is not now, nor ever will be, the solution. It is not planned to be a replacement airport, nor should it be. It will not even be an adequate second airport.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is built, it will not solve the problems of inner Sydney, but it will create problems of its own, including noise pollution for tens of thousands of Sydney residents. It will further degrade the catchment of the Hawkesbury&hyphen;Nepean and will obliterate areas of significance in terms of Aboriginal heritage and remnant vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sydney's air quality, which is already known to be in a critical condition, will give the final coup de grace if Badgerys Creek airport is built. If you want to turn Sydney into Los Angeles, build an airport at Badgerys. The only solution to Sydney's airport dilemma is to build a replacement airport. Kingsford Smith should be downgraded and eventually closed. Some people are going to say that the Greens are crazy if they think Kingsford Smith can be closed. We say, alternatively, or in the opposite direction, it is crazy to think that it can stay there. Many economic experts, such as Professor Gordon Mills from the Sydney University's Centre of Micreoeconomic Policy Analysis, believe that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxpayers will get a better return on their money if the land now occupied by the airport were to be utilised for residential, commercial and recreational purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The replacement airport should be outside the Sydney basin air shed and able to be connected with fast train links. The site selection process should be reopened now before any further mistakes are made. We should look at all potential sites and investigate their feasibility and environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is that myth being promulgated about this bill that it will enshrine in legislation the present levels of access to Kingsford Smith by regional airlines. The bill does not do that. Presumably, given the promises that are being made, the regulations will include such a provision. But it is not in the bill, and the regulations are more easily changed than is the actual legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we continue along the present path there is nothing surer than that the regional airlines will eventually be squeezed out of Kingsford Smith. A second airport at Badgerys Creek will facilitate that. Under this so&hyphen;called cap, the day could come when for 17 hours a day there will be 80 movements every hour, and they will all be jet movements. What sort of cap is that?</PARA></SPEECH>

Kingsford Smith Airport has a peak charge operating at present which is a tool for management to encourage a better distribution across the 16-hour spectrum, or whatever it is, when the airport is open.

But coupled with that, Senator Cook, can I tell you that we are looking at training our youth, as you well know, with our apprenticeship scheme to give an opportunity to our youth for real jobs.

They are certainly not in Australia's interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's greenhouse challenge program is a cooperative, voluntary agreement between the federal government and industry, with industry committed to specific emission reduction targets and reporting back annually on progress. Four of Australia's largest companies&mdash;Rio Tinto, BHP, Shell and ICI&mdash;in August lodged the first reports under the program showing that all were reducing their emissions on a per unit of production basis. In two years, 200 organisations have become greenhouse challengers; 53 cooperative agreements have been signed, and more than 40 other agreements are likely to be finalised before the Kyoto conference. The agreements signed to date will reduce the companies' forecast greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000 by an equivalent of 17 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central to the Clinton proposal was the consultation process between industry, key energy sectors and government on how best to reduce emissions and encourage use of energy efficient products. President Clinton also said that American companies would be given credit for early action to provide an immediate incentive for them to act early. He said that the USA would pursue industry by industry consultations with key industry sectors on how they could best reduce emissions and encourage the use of energy efficient products. This is the basis of the greenhouse challenge program. The similarity between this element of the US proposal and Australia's greenhouse challenge has been noted by my colleague Senator Hill in his comments on the US proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greenhouse Challenge Office is attending the climate change negotiations in Bonn to raise international awareness and understanding of the objectives and achievements of the greenhouse challenge program. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8464"> program is attracting strong interest from international delegates about this partnership approach between government and industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia the Greenhouse Challenge Office, government and peak industry associations in the energy, mining, manufacturing, commercial transport and services sectors have been working to encourage companies to improve their energy efficiency and adopt world's best practice in the efficient use of energy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Heffernan for this most important question. There are two parts to this question. I will deal first with the second part, international practice, because the opposition might be interested to know what Tony Blair had to say about this in his address to the Labor conference in Brighton; in fact, he stressed education. In his speech last month, he set a target of 80 per cent of students meeting the standard in literacy by 2002; for numeracy, the target was to be 75 per cent by the year 2002. Tony Blair agrees with what we are doing. Recently, when I attended the UNESCO conference in Paris, there was an overwhelming sentiment that literacy was most important in today's world; and there was recognition of what this government was doing in relation to literacy and numeracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just have a look at what this government has been doing. In March this year, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, called for a national effort to promote the literacy and numeracy skills of young Australians. Com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8465"> monwealth, state and territory education ministers have subsequently agreed to a national literacy and numeracy goal. That goal is that `every child leaving primary school should be numerate, be able to read, write and spell at an appropriate level'. As well as that, the minister has also adopted a subgoal; that is, that `every child commencing school from 1998 will achieve a minimum acceptable literacy and numeracy standard within four years'. It was also agreed that the goals would be achieved through a national literacy and numeracy plan which focuses on the crucial early years of schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that it is important that students' progress can be measured, and education ministers agreed that national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy should be set for years 3, 5, 7 and 9. Assessment against the benchmarks and national reporting achievements are key elements of this national plan. Education ministers will consider the approval of a final year 3 and year 5 literacy benchmark at the next ministerial council, scheduled for 12 December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth makes a significant financial contribution to schools in the sum of $3.8 billion a year. In the last two federal budgets schools funding has been one of the few areas of federal expenditure which has been quarantined from cuts. In fact, for literacy there has been an increase of over $80 million over the four years from 1997 to the year 2000. This government has already committed $669 million for literacy and numeracy in those four years. Of this amount, $650 million is allocated to education authorities for grants to schools. As well as this, the Commonwealth is also providing $19 million to fund national literacy strategies and projects. This includes $7 million for professional development for teachers in all government and non-government educational systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, this government recognises quite clearly that this is an issue which has to be addressed which the last government failed to address. This government believes that the goal of Australian schools should be to ensure that all Australian children reach their full educational and personal potential.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not figures plucked out of the air. These are figures based on inquiries made at the point of sale. I know that Mr McMullan, who has lately taken an interest in this issue, has certainly suggested that there is not such a great price differential, but of course he is comparing New Zealand prices with Australian prices for a CD using a different exchange rate.

But the fact is that the exchange rate was supplied to the government by AAP at the time of the actual purchase in New Zealand, not an artificial rate a week old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also found it of interest that Mr McMullan's press release did confirm that New Zealand consumers pay less for their CDs than Australian consumers and that is one of the matters that is of great concern to us. If there is such a significant price differential, why do prices need to be so high in Australia? Is it because if you control the market, you can decide to charge whatever you think the market will bear? If you think that the New Zealand market is more depressed or it is smaller and they will not be able to pay the same price, therefore you sell them more cheaply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a completely false premise. The opposition is again trying to beat this up, and some of the media have suggested that rising child&hyphen;care fees are forcing women out of the work force. But it is important to look at the facts. Let us look at the facts. Decisions to increase fees are made by service providers, not by government. It is a free market. Fee structures in child care are influenced by several factors such as movements in award wages; charging practices; changes to regulations or increases in overheads, such as rates, insurance and utilities&mdash;something that those on the other side would have no concept of because they have never been in a decent occupation in private enterprise where people understand these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the ABS labour force figures show that the total participation rate for females with dependent children under 15 years has remained relatively stable&mdash;about 59 per cent since January 1996&mdash;so there has been no change. But `Don't let the facts interfere with the argument' is the opposition's approach. Thirdly, preliminary 1997 child care census data shows that the average weekly full&hyphen;time fee for families attending long day care centres is now around $160. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8473"> This is only slightly above the trend over the last six years that has seen increases of around six per cent, or between $6 and $10 per year for families using full time care. So there has been no change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government the graph shows identical change. Senator Faulkner may not be aware of that, but there has been no change. So to suggest that there has been some dramatic change is completely false. But `Don't let the facts interfere with the argument,' is what the opposition says. Claims that the government's child&hyphen;care measures have forced women out of the work force have no basis in fact when a responsible analysis of the data is undertaken. But responsibility is not something that one usually associates with the opposition&mdash;just as they are creating the apparent firestorm in relation to aged care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are civic minded citizens who want the system to be as clean as possible and they have been ringing in all morning wanting to do their bit to help save taxpayers' funds and to protect those who are genuinely entitled to government support. The community supports our law enforcement efforts because they know what went before over the last 13 years. And does the Labor Party support our efforts? Do they even care about $28 million every week being saved for the taxpayer? It does not appear to be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election we promised to fix the social security system and what was Labor's response? The then minister, Mr Baldwin said, `The savings the coalition pretends it can glean from the social security system do not exist.' That is what he said. Labor just would not admit there was a problem so they went on continuing to provide a hammock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that we are saving $28 million a week in fraud and compliance, have they admitted they are wrong? No, they have not. The shadow minister, Jenny Macklin, said this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a huge increase in activity for no returns.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask you: what does she mean `for no returns'? There has been a 27 per cent increase in reviews. Is that not a return? A 47 per cent increase in debts recovered. Is that no return? A 47 per cent increase, as well, in debts identified for collection through the year. Is that no return? How about a 23 per cent increase in public tip&hyphen;offs? Is that no return? That demonstrates that the public are serious. And how about the 32 per cent increase in referral to the DPP, which is going to show an increase in convictions during this year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Macklin obviously cannot read the annual report of the department where it is absolutely clear as clear that in the last year of Labor the number of referrals to the DPP dropped off&mdash;inevitably affecting the number of convictions in the last financial year. So you will see an increase in convictions, I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sad to say, in this financial year as a result of our 32 per cent extra effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And if Ms Macklin thinks that finding 330,000 people breaking the law is unimportant, is no return, it just goes to show that Labor is still not listening to Australians, not to taxpayers, not to families, not to the community. Our government does listen and it acts and, with $28 million a week being saved, it gets results. The difference is that Labor was not prepared to take the tough decisions; they were not prepared to deal with mismanagement and inadequate administration. They are cynical opportunists; they do not believe in good governance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been the response since the report was tabled yesterday. It contrasts with the reaction that the British government has made to these issues. They have introduced a tip&hyphen;off line which has had one&hyphen;quarter of a million people respond to it in the last year. They are keen to do better because they see it as the responsibility of a citizen to report breaches of the law wherever they occur. It is very important that we recognise in Australia that this is not antisocial; it is a civic responsibility for all of us&mdash;government and the people&mdash;to uphold the law.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR WEST asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: What is going to be the impact upon often middle-aged children if they move into their parents' home to care for a frail aged parent? They may well continue to work and hold down a full-time job, but they will continue to work and hold down a fulltime job, but they will still be able to keep their frail aged parent out of a nursing home for a number of years, but less than five years. I wanted the Minister to look at the impact on those middle-aged children. Has the Government chosen the time period of five years deliberately because it has evidence that most carers who do this crucial work, do it for less than this time period before their parents become too frail for them to stay at home?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR HERRON&mdash;The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government recognises the invaluable work of carers, whether or not they are in employment and whether or not they are living with the person they are caring for. We acknowledge that, however long they care for, and whatever other commitments they may have, this is a difficult and emotionally demanding job and one that deserves our acknowledgment and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to community concerns about the protections for the family home, the Government announced on 27 October that the home would not be counted as an asset for accommodation bond purposes where a carer who was eligible for a pension or benefit had lived there for at least two years, not five years as currently stated in the Aged Care Act 1997. This improved protection for carers will be made effective from the commencement of the new arrangements on 1 October 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protections of the family home in the Aged Care Act were developed in consultation with consumer and industry groups, including the Carers' Association. The five year protection was agreed after discussion by the Funding and other Implementation Issues Working Group, including a representative of the Carers' Association, and was accepted by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view was that this protection should be restricted to people who had been living in the home on a long term basis, who had no significant means of support other than their pensions, and who would face genuine hardship if they had to leave the home.</PARA>

This government's total disregard for the thousands of jobs that will be jeopardised by parallel importing further demonstrates their lack of concern for jobs, job security and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston's ludicrous assertion that CDs are cheaper in New Zealand and the United States ignores the fact that the US has lower sales tax and lower regulatory rates for artists and composers. New Zealand does not have a strong record industry like Australia's, and in fact most of their major artists come here because our record industry offers them some protection and security. There is no real investment in local talent in New Zealand, their taxation system is different and they have lower advertising rates, which impacts upon the cost of CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston's bungled efforts in this matter are highlighted by the fact that neither the United States nor New Zealand allow parallel importing. In fact, as far as I am aware, no OECD country allows parallel importing. The basic fact is that, if parallel importing is to be allowed, then Australian artists will be worse off. Japan, which is probably one example that we could argue does allow parallel importing, does so at a higher retail price than Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does Senator Alston propose to ensure that any potential drop in the wholesale price of CDs will be passed on to consumers? Already one leading Australian company, Shock Records, have pointed out that, although their recommended retail price is $27.95, their products are often sold for $30. In other words, Minister, your government cannot guarantee that retailers will pass on any savings to consumers. Your proposals will do absolutely nothing to benefit Australian consumers and instead will destabilise a vital industry for the sake of a possible saving of $1.60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that Senator Alston actually buys CDs. If he bothered to visit a few local retailers here in Canberra&mdash;we could certainly do with a few more Liberal dollars spent locally&mdash;he might discover that most department or chain stores offer between $3 and $7 off the recommended retail price. Parallel importing, which will place at risk thousands of jobs, will not improve the current state of record prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the major concern to Australian small businesses is the risk to jobs and job security resulting from the proposed changes. Approximately 95 per cent of recordings currently sold in Australia are locally manufactured, and the job security of thousands of people presently employed in this thriving local industry will be placed at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston is also content to place at risk hundreds of jobs in the freight industry. CD distribution is one of the biggest users of freight in Australia, and job security in the freight industry will be at risk if parallel importing is allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I question whether Senator Alston is genuinely committed to maintaining a vibrant and world renowned music industry. If the minister has his way, artists like Savage Garden, You Am I, Hoodoo Gurus and countless others would not exist. Yet again Senator Alston demonstrates complete insensitivity and a total lack of understanding of the implications that parallel importing will have on Australian jobs and Australian culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am gravely concerned that the minister, who is also responsible for all matters relating to intellectual property in the area of new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8479"> media, is taking this position with respect to parallel importing, with its impact on copyright and neighbouring rights.

It can be equally argued the other way. In fact, it will increase employment. Senator Lundy also made the spurious claim that it would affect the freight industry. Again, we reject that. Quite frankly, we expect that more CDs will come into the country because of this decision and therefore more CDs will be carried by freight. It was a spurious claim because with more CDs coming into the country the freight industry, quite logically, will be advantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Lundy's motion to take note of the dreadful answer that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) gave to her question today. Senator McGauran has just given the most hilarious defence I have ever heard in any area of government policy. As it came from the National Party, it should not surprise one. If you talked to Senator Boswell about these matters, he would take a completely different view, just as he did on protecting newsagencies and pharmacies. According to Senator McGauran, if you own a CD shop you apparently should be hung out to dry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this month we pointed out that Senator Alston clearly gave misleading information to the Senate about the price discrepancy between the price of a CD in Australia and the price of the same CD in New Zealand. Senator Lundy's question clearly pointed out that the information he gave in his answer on 20 October was clearly misleading. Senator Lundy has exposed him very successfully and succinctly on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Alston was exposed on this, what was his defence? He said, `Oh, well, inquiries were made.' He did not say that he had made the inquiries himself. He left the potential there to blame someone else. As is usual with this minister, whenever he is caught out he always blames somebody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 19 months as minister, he has had quite a track record for blaming somebody else. For example, in February this year, when he was asked about his department's discussion paper on cross-media ownership&mdash;apparently it did not then fit with his view that he was trying to do a deal with Mr Packer&mdash;he described it as `pretty tired stuff' and implied that his department did not know what it was on about. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A bit later on we saw another example of the minister blaming his staff. When it was exposed that a question which was prepared first of all in the Prime Minister's office and then in the minister's office was to go to Senator Coonan to attack Mr Kerry O'Brien and the ABC's program at an estimates committee, this minister said, `It's not my fault; it was my staff's fault. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know nothing about it.' That was his defence. It is a consistent pattern of this minister that he never accepts responsibility for little plans and little issues that go wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Coonan did not ask the question. She handed it over to Senator Eggleston, who dumped it on the table and very quickly went as far as he could away from it. It is the pattern of this minister to consistently blame others, to never accept responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Earlier this year in estimates hearings Senator Carr pointed out that an answer we had received from the minister to a question on notice was contradictory to what he had said in estimates about job losses in Telstra over a period of time. He blithely said, `I didn't see the question. One of my staff or department wrote that. They didn't clear it with me. I have no responsibility.' It was lodged here as an answer to a question on notice in his name. He blamed the staff again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another document that was leaked from his own department was about funding in the ABC and the fact that it was contrary to his policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better communications</EMPHASIS>. What did he do? He said, `I didn't see the cabinet submission. It wasn't my cover note. It is all the department's fault.' Even a submission that he had lodged under his name in the cabinet room was not his fault&mdash;he had not seen it; he blamed the department.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He made poor old Neville Stevens take 100 per cent of the blame at the estimates committee. The incompetent minister did not see what was going on. If that was the truth, he made Neville Stevens take the fall for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article written by Ann Davies earlier this year, on 26 February, about cross-ownership rules was embarrassing to the minister. He immediately said, `I was misquoted.' He never took the trouble to put a writ or write a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> saying that it was wrong. An article appeared earlier this week, again by Ann Davies, which talked about a whole number of policy issues that the minister has deferred till next year, telling representatives of the media industry that they would not be dealt with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that we bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that Senator Alston&mdash;who was to be the shining star of the government but who has fallen a long way from there&mdash;came into the Senate and stated what he said were facts with regard to the prices of CDs in New Zealand. The truth is that he was totally incorrect. I will read a couple of paragraphs from a letter written by Geoff Sherning, the Finance Director of Warner Music, New Zealand, to Gary Smerdon, the Finance Director of Warner Music, Australia. It goes to the very point that was raised with regard to the question of Savage Garden CDs. The letter states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">As the only wholesaler licensed to distribute this title in New Zealand in the marketplace, we can confirm that all CD units have been sold at the PPD of $NZ19.65. This is a fact; we can be audited and is therefore beyond challenge. We are staggered that the assertion has been that this product is predominantly retailing at $NZ18.80. To further clarify how absurd this assertion is we have today confirmed with our top key retailers the current retail prices of which they are selling Savage Garden. The sample is representative of six to five per cent of our total business.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then lists the prices at which CDs are sold at a number of stores: warehouses, $26.99; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sound stores, $34.95; True Tone stores, $33.95; ECM stores, $33.95; Marbecks stores, $33.99; CD stores, $33.95; and compact disk shops, $29.95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that people would like to have cheaper CDs; we all would. But the reality is that some of the assertions being made by the minister are totally incorrect. In considering the whole issue, as we did on a number of occasions when we were in government, we took account of the jobs that are dependant on this industry. I am referring not only to direct jobs but also to jobs across the board in areas such as transport, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take account of this claim about delivering cheaper CDs, you come down to how those sales are made up in terms of the sales in retail shops. Top 40 music probably makes up about 80 per cent of their sales. The other 60 varieties of music, if you like, out of 100 will make up 20 per cent of their sales. If you bring about a position where there is parallel importing&mdash;and the competition in the existing music industry in Australia is such that they will have to cut their costs and finetune the manufacturing process such that you will get a restriction with regard to choice&mdash;you will not get lower prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get pirated CDs coming into the marketplace, the fact is that the music retailers that are selling top 40 music will set the price. All the CDs that are supposed to be cheaper will be brought up to that price level. It is simply not true to say that there will be a reduction in price. That has occurred in other countries. I think it was in Sweden or Norway where they introduced parallel importing and then got rid of it after 10 years. That is why, for Senator Ferguson's benefit, we never took a decision to introduce parallel importing, and rightly so. It is important that we do protect the jobs in the music industry. For the development of our own musicians in this country, we must maintain a set of circumstances where we do foster them, protect the jobs and ensure that it runs more efficiently. There is nothing wrong with that. In so far as competition is concerned, I know that all retailers and indeed people within the music industry are more than prepared to accept competition. But you will have no

<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the question is timely, particularly in relation to the fall in stock markets at the present time. It does give rise to an interesting question that I think everybody should be debating much more extensively in this country about investing in markets for retirement income purposes and comparing such an investment with a return from a government's social security system. I draw Senators' attention to a recent book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Promises to Keep&mdash;Saving Social Security's Dream</EMPHASIS>  by Americans from State Street Bank and Trust Co., Marshall N. Carter and William G. Shipman. One of these gentlemen is currently in Australia and I understand he will be addressing the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia conference tomorrow, if he has not already done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray's question was based on Will Hutton's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>newspaper article on markets. My contribution is not to comment on the article but to use the market linkage to look at the efficiency of market investments for retirement. If one looks at moneys invested over a long period of time, such as 30 to 40 years&mdash;and this is the period in which we have to set aside money for retirement income purposes&mdash;you see that income derived from the market, such as investments on the Stock Exchange, produce a much more efficient and higher return than that which can be derived through most social security systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems in most Western societies are that people are living longer. On the other hand, most of these countries are not getting the big increases in population because of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> declining birth numbers and, particularly in Australia, there is fairly static migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short term, governments can overcome retirement financing problems by reducing social security benefits for aged care on the one hand or, on the other, by increasing</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">taxes. Unfortunately, there is no end over time to which the taxes have to rise in order to meet an ageing population's retirement needs. In our society we are finding increasingly a reluctance, particularly from the young, to both meet their own retirement income needs and provide the funds for the retired out of current taxation. In addition, we are living in a part of the world&mdash;the Asian region&mdash;which has low taxes on income. So in Australia we want low taxes but, at the same time, we expect social security benefits equal to the Swedish type models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments around the world are finding increasing difficulty in meeting their government retirement pensions. However, in the long term we have to look very clearly at investment in markets to generate the necessary retirement funds. Australia is in a transition. At the present time government meets 80 per cent of retirement pension needs. Under SIS, Australia will have a nine per cent levy on employers by the year 2002 to meet the SGC, but for most Australians this mechanism will not be sufficient. Australia will have to provide vehicles or incentives where people are compelled to lock away additional moneys such as through markets for their retirement to ensure that they are going to get an above return compared with what could be provided through a government pension system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve such an outcome governments must be cognisant of the fact that they must keep the tax rates relatively low on savings income for retirement purposes. The acknowledged maximum figure around the world is about 30 per cent. Regrettably, in Australia we have taxes on entry, taxes on earnings and taxes on exits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the last few minutes remaining to me, I must state one essential feature. One must start investing early and establish a continuous saving pattern. This will enable the benefits of compounding to grow the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8484"> investment significantly. Compounding has a very magical influence. At an eight per cent return over 10 years the investment doubles. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Before I get into the substance of my comments, I would like to make some observations with regard to the contribution of Senator Ellison today in question time. I must say that I thought it was a fairly pathetic performance. I did notice that his performance per se has improved, but the content has not improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in Senator Ellison's reference to the MTIA. I have&mdash;as I am sure he has&mdash;read the MTIA <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Make or break</EMPHASIS> report. In particular, I am quite interested that you regard that as a big tick for the government when, in fact, the report is quite scathing about this government with regard to its lack of industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, when the Treasurer, Mr Costello, addressed the MTIA dinner&mdash;and Senator Ellison himself referred to the seven&hyphen;point plan the MTIA has&mdash;Mr Costello did not get past  the second point. He got to point 1 and then he got to point 2, but he did not get past the second point. He raved on and on about getting the fundamentals right, getting low inflation right, getting interest rate cuts, and so on. `Hang on there, folks, the whole thing's going to change, just hang on there and be patient'&mdash;as I think one minister said&mdash;`be patient, it will happen.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to Senator Ellison's contribution at question time, the reality is that he was asked a very specific question and that is: what is the growth target of this government? That question was not answered. It has been asked a number of times in this chamber and it has never been answered. I have an answer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Senator Ellison. Your growth target is four per cent. How do I know this? Because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself set that as a growth target in one of his headland speeches prior to the last election. He said&mdash;and I can remember it vividly&mdash;that no government can hope to make a real dent in unemployment unless the growth rate exceeds four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the last financial year we ended up with a growth rate of 2.5 per cent. At the moment, depending on who you believe and which set of statistics you look at, the best possible construction you can put on the current growth rate is about 3.25 per cent. That is nowhere near four per cent. The Prime Minister has failed on his own benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the record of this government with regard to unemployment. I say again&mdash;as I have said in this chamber many times&mdash;when this government came to office unemployment was at 8.4 per cent. What is it now? Unemployment is currently running, as everybody knows, at 8.6 per cent. In fact, not only has this government failed to deliver specific initiatives to combat what is Australia's greatest problem, but they have sent the whole show backwards. We are going backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet again in this chamber I commend the previous employment minister, the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone, for her candour when she said that if this particular government does not get unemployment below eight per cent it does not deserve to get re&hyphen;elected. My view is that it does not deserve to get re&hyphen;elected on a whole series of fronts, but she has also set a benchmark. So we have two benchmarks: one set by the Prime Minister that the growth rate must be four per cent; and another one set by the previous employment minister, Senator Vanstone, that this government has to get unemployment below eight per cent or this government will not get elected. They are your benchmarks and they are the answers to the questions that Senator Ellison could not answer today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am on this subject, I would like to address some of the points raised in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article that the Democrats have made much of. They asserted  that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8487"> 3.3 million jobs have been lost over the last decade. That is completely wrong. The Democrats have taken that figure from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article on Monday, 20 October which reported that there had been 3.3 million full&hyphen;time retrenchments between 1986 and 1997 and interpreted this as being the figure for net jobs lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be Einstein to work out that there is a difference between loss of full&hyphen;time jobs and retrenchments. The reality is that there were in fact three million full&hyphen;time retrenchments in the decade to 1996. They were actually offset&mdash;and this is the way it works&mdash;by the creation of many more jobs. People get retrenched, they move out of the work force, more jobs are created and people move into the new jobs. That is the way it works. It is pretty simple. As I said, you do not have to be Einstein to work that one out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that over the period of the Hawke and Keating governments two million net jobs were created. What has happened&mdash;and even this government understands it and the MTIA certainly does&mdash;is that there has been a shift of jobs from manufacturing to services as part of a worldwide structural economic transition and adjustment. The Democrats are clearly, in my view, unaware that there can be a shift in the composition of employment without an overall fall in numbers. That is pretty simple to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the record here that we regard it as absolutely offensive that the Democrats lump us in with that lot on the other side in terms of job creation. I might say that, if this is the Democrats' position with regard to the middle ground, they are going to fall right through the hole in the middle ground. They are not going to capture the middle ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of unemployment today is that the Howard government, unlike the previous Labor government, has absolutely retreated from a role of managing and shaping economic change. Let us cast our minds back to when we came into government in 1983. In 1983 unemployment was at 10 per cent. It was at 10 per cent because the Howard&hyphen;Fraser government's entire job strategy in terms of decreasing unemployment was getting infla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion down. Does it sound familiar? That was the big strategy&mdash;to get inflation down and everything else will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that is not the way the world works. The number of jobs throughout the 1980s grew steadily. There was an economic boom in the 1980s. In Australia jobs growth was higher than any other OECD country mainly because the previous Labor government actually decided to do something about the job situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a whole series of initiatives by Labor. This is why I find the Democrats lumping us in with the government a bit offensive. There were stacks of things that the government did. For example, there was the community employment program which was allocated $300 million to fund 70,000 full&hyphen;time jobs averaging six months each on labour intensive projects of social and economic benefit to the community. There was also the subsidised work study traineeships for young people arising out of the Kirby report and in 1989 the official unemployment rate fell below six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a recession in the early 1990s. It just did not happen here. There was a worldwide recession in the 1990s and obviously unemployment rose very sharply at that point. Labor acted very quickly, unlike this government, which simply attends to what it regards as the economic fundamentals, which do not seem to include growth or setting an actual jobs target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the expansionary job creation policies of infrastructure spending in One Nation in February 1992. We acted very quickly. Then we had Working Nation, which was introduced in May 1994 and we aimed to reduce the unemployment rate to five per cent by the year 2000. We put it on the record. We said that we aimed to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. This government has not had the intestinal fortitude to make even any kind of statement. All they talk about is budget forecasts. We want to know what your jobs target is. We were prepared to put our money where our mouth was and put it on the record. You put it on the record.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8488">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government introduced Working Nation and boosted spending on active labour market programs as a proportion of GDP from 0.27 per cent in 1990&hyphen;1991 to 0.73 per cent in 1994&hyphen;95, moving us from one of the lowest spending nations in the OECD with regard to this to being approximately in the middle&mdash;hardly what one would call profligate, hardly what the present government regards as a high spending, high taxing government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result unemployment&mdash;especially long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;began to fall. Overall, 740,000 jobs were created in Labor's last term of office. However, there is no doubt that when we left office&mdash;and we do not resile from this fact&mdash;unemployment was still too high, at 8.4 per cent. We think it is absolutely appalling that after 18 months of the coalition government it is 8.6 per cent. All you have done is increase unemployment. That is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what this government's record is in terms of its so&hyphen;called `job creation strategy'. What do you do if you have an unemployment crisis if you are this government? You cut jobs. That is this government's solution to the unemployment crisis. Since this government was elected, 80,000 jobs have been cut out of the Commonwealth and state government sectors. When you cut that amount of jobs out of the public sector, you directly affect regional Australia. I know that very well in terms of my home state of Tasmania. If you cut the heart out of the public sector, it has a direct effect on the economy and on the amount of money circulating, not to mention on the people who lose their jobs and lose access to the services that people in regional Australia lose access to. As well there are the social implications of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dries over there would at least concede that when you cut that number of jobs out of an economy it impacts disproportionately on the regions and means there is less money going around the regions. Go no further than asking the Premier of Tasmania, Tony Rundle, to confirm what I have just said. Go no further than asking the Tasmanian Department of Development and Resources to confirm what I have just said.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After falling every month for 32 consecutive months under Labor, the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed has jumped by 58,500 since May 1996, due to this government freezing, cutting and then abolishing numerous successful Working Nation programs. Again, my state of Tasmania has been particularly badly affected. We lost $40 million to $50 million over three years as a result of the cuts to Working Nation. That initiative has not been well received in my home state of Tasmania&mdash;and this government has not been well received there either. I am quite confident of an increase in seats for Labor in the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, unemployment has actually gone up to 8.6 per cent, despite a big drop of half a percentage point in the participation rate, as many people give up hope and drop right out of the labour market. I am not going into the fairly simple arithmetic of drops in the participation rate and drops in the labour force and how that affects the unemployment rate. That is a complex argument for the government to understand, but it is evident to most of us that there is a clear nexus&mdash;a clear connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did this government do? As I said, they cut jobs out of the public sector. They cut 22,000 workers out of Telstra, they abolished a whole series of innovative and strategic interventionist&mdash;to use the new phrase that the Prime Minister (John Howard) is using&mdash;industry programs. Although Mr Howard talks a lot about strategic intervention, we have not seen much of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government abolished DIFF and slashed EMDG and support for research and development. If you go around and talk to small to medium enterprises about the impact this has had, it is disastrous. Here we have a situation where we are attempting to get into export markets, and what this government does is slash the very programs that SMEs require in order to get into those export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Calvert is here, and I am sure he is aware&mdash;although I appreciate that he will not be able to say this&mdash;that that is precisely what Tasmanian businesses are saying. On the Senate Economics References Committee we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8489"> did the round of Tasmanian businesses to talk about industry policy, and that is what they were saying. Businesses everywhere are saying, `We needed those programs and we want them back.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else did this government do? It dismantled the employment service&mdash;bungle! Senator Vanstone could not get her own way, so she pulled the bill. I would be interested to know whether Senator Ellison could tell us how the government's new employment services regime is going to be instituted without legislation. How is that going to happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are much more pro&hyphen;active. We believe unemployment is a high priority. We would generate economic growth at annual rates better than four per cent, as we did before, in order to make serious inroads into unemployment. Labor will support Australian industry through intervention and strategic assistance. We have the runs on the board there. We will tackle the high concentrations of unemployment in regional areas through the creation of public sector programs to deliver where they are most needed. We have a genuine strategy. We have put our cards on the table in terms of what we want to do. We would like this government to put its cards on the table.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay was saying what the Labor Party would do for regional Australia. She said they would be creating public works programs. What a turnaround on 13 years of Labor policy this is. Labor totally neglected regional Australia. If you look at the capital works programs of the previous Labor government, over 13 years the graph declines drastically. They chopped it in half over that time. So to come in here and say as your final point, `We are going to increase public works programs,' is humbug. You had 13 years to do it. You did not do it and, if you ever get back into government, you will not do it either. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me focus on the record of the Labor government. Labor senators come in here and criticise the current government, but it has only been 18 months since they left government, and we remember very clearly their record on unemployment over that time. There was a massive increase in long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;which is the focus of this motion&mdash;over the last 10 years. That largely resulted from the failed policies&mdash;such as the so&hyphen;called Working Nation program&mdash;of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One&hyphen;third of the total number of unemployed became long&hyphen;term unemployed under their government&mdash;a disgraceful record. If you look at the total figures of unemployment over that time, you will find that Labor's average was 8.5 per cent&mdash;over 13 years. That is the best a so&hyphen;called Labor government could do. What a total disgrace. We all remember when they pushed it to the highest point of all in the recession we had to have, according to Mr Keating. It got up to 11.2 per cent because of the previous Labor government's total inability to handle the economy of this country. They sent the economy into a boom and then brought it to a bust with a shuddering halt, with terrible ramifications for the people who are unemployed, particularly the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not until Australia started to come out of that recession that they really started to try and come up with a serious program for dealing with it. So as they were heading into the next boom they were actually trying to grapple with the problems of the previous recession. It certainly was too little too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Working Nation program was an absolutely hopeless failure, and I want to spend some time going into the reasons why it was a failure. There are a lot of lessons for government in the way in which they tried to tackle this problem and the enormous amount of money they wasted on very poor outcomes&mdash;very poor in an economic sense but even tragic in terms of the social and personal consequences of putting some people into jobs temporarily and then pulling them back out again when they were not able to get long&hyphen;term employment. The programs under Working Nation were expensive, they were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8490"> very badly targeted and they achieved poor job outcomes. There was even a very devious attempt by the ALP to hide the real numbers of Australians whose lives were blighted by long&hyphen;term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to a more detailed critique of Labor's Working Nation, which so clearly failed the long&hyphen;term unemployed. In 1994 I chaired the Senate employment, education and training inquiry into long&hyphen;term unemployment. We held extensive hearings on this matter and gathered evidence from many parts of Australia. It revealed that long&hyphen;term unemployment was an absolutely desperate problem. What was particularly unfortunate about it was the nature of the groups that it targeted. Those who had been in disadvantaged groups before this problem reached the size that it did in society were affected, yet again, disproportionately. I refer particularly to the youth of this country, to older Australians, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to people who come from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, and to people in regional Australia and the outer suburbs of the major cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry that we held highlighted three overall failings of this Working Nation program. First of all, it created a negative perception of training as a useless exercise to those people who were involved. They really could not see it leading anywhere and, for 70 per cent of them, it certainly did not. They were back in the unemployed&mdash;but not the long&hyphen;term unemployed. Because of the way Labor changed the definition, they were regarded as newly created unemployed people. The effect of all this was to artificially push down the long&hyphen;term unemployment rate according to official statistics. That was just a little bit of magic the Labor government created to try and make their record look better. In reality, it was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second overall failing related to the churning of the unemployment queues that robbed the participants of hope when, at the end of training, there was no real job. The real problem with what Labor tried to do at that time is that they put people into training saying that that would make them job&hyphen;ready when the jobs came. But the jobs did not come and, because they did not link the sorts 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of training often to real job outcomes, the effect, tragically, for 70 per cent of the long&hyphen;term unemployed who were involved in the Working Nation programs was no jobs at all. So they were returned to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A closer examination of Working Nation underlines how it failed to deliver particular job outcomes. There were fewer people successful in the private sector wage subsidy program, for example. Labor's wage subsidy placements in 1994&hyphen;95, at the height of Working Nation, were actually 50 per cent below the targets. Instead, Labor increased the proportion of expensive programs with very poor job outcomes, such as the new work opportunities program. Each new wave job actually cost the taxpayer $143,000. The success rate was so poor that, when you averaged out what the program cost for each successful placement, it was $143,000. Obviously, they persisted with some very ineffective programs. In my own region, in northern New South Wales, they boosted the amount of money they poured into these programs just before the 1996 elections to make it appear that unemployment was dropping. These people had been redefined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they brought in Working Nation, the Labor government also created case management systems. The concept of case management is really quite good, but they applied it in a very unsatisfactory way. For a start, they did not have enough case managers. Also, there was, under their case management system, something which we have subsequently corrected: there was really no incentive to get clients into real jobs. Money spent on these programs was often wasted; for example, training people who could not swim or who had a chlorine allergy to be swimming instructors. That was one of the things they were doing. Money for programs was often redirected to advertising campaigns&mdash;flashy ads like those ones you saw with Bill Hunter in them&mdash;trying to make out to the public how successful this all was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just prior to the last election, Labor spent $860 million on three of the worst performing Working Nation programs in terms of outcomes. That is almost one billion dollars on three highly unsuccessful programs: new work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8491"> opportunities, which I have mentioned before, LEAP and jobskills. This is a disgraceful outcome for a so&hyphen;called Labor government. Since the election, the Howard government has carried out what the people of Australia wanted&mdash;a shake&hyphen;up of these major programs. We have spent, in the time since we have been in government, in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, $1.6 billion on labour market programs. That is about the same amount as Labor was spending on Working Nation before they lost government. But we have been spending it far more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take the opposition through our efforts to make labour market assistance more effective for the unemployed than the programs they ran previously. We do not attempt to conceal the truth, as the Labor Party has done, on employment. Any Australian would be able to confirm to you that the labour market remains flat, but the figures in September have shown a very positive pick&hyphen;up, with 70,000 new jobs being created under the policies of this government. We are not talking about artificial jobs that are going to disappear in six months time; we are talking about real jobs that have a prospect of people holding on to them as time goes on. We have clearly indicated our compact with the Australian people to do something about unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind Senator Mackay and the Australian people what the Howard government has done in this job creation area. First of all, we have got the economic fundamentals in this country right. We have turned the federal budget into the black, which has great benefit to business and those that employ and create real jobs. We have turned around Labor's $10 billion deficit, restored the economic fundamentals so that Australia has the best economic outlook that it has had in a generation: the lowest interest rates since 1969 and the lowest inflation rate since 1962. This provides the conditions for small business, the economic generators, the business and job generators in this country, to create real jobs. As I outlined earlier, real job opportunities were never achieved under Working Nation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, our government has acted almost immediately to free up the industrial relations system. The Workplace Relations Act has made significant changes that have actually removed barriers to business employing staff. The changes to ALP Minister Brereton's unfair dismissal laws have assisted a very large number of large and medium sized businesses. The opposition parties in the Senate are now incurring the wrath of small business in this country as they stand in the way of further unfair dismissal reform.</PARA>

So Labor, who created the problem for small business in creating jobs, are now exacerbating it, in cahoots with the Democrats and the Greens. That is continuing and will continue unless these parties change their minds and turn this around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me canvass for the opposition a range of other initiatives that are now in place under this government to deal with job creation. Labor decimated the apprenticeship system in this country. In their last year there were 60,000 people in apprenticeships, and under this government there are 200,000 new apprenticeships being created. We have created the common youth allowance to focus youth on the vital links between training and unemployment. The work for the dole program will ensure that long&hyphen;term unemployed are relinked to work opportunities and training. We are reforming labour market programs in this country so that they will be more effective. We are still continuing the spending at the same level, but we are making it far more effective than before. Labor's demonstrated

I trust his time here will be very profitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  The debate that we have here this afternoon is a rather interesting one. The government senator who took up this issue a moment ago was talking about the training programs of the last government. I do not really want to get too much into that sort of stuff because I think, in essence, what happened in the Hawke&hyphen;Keating years was an honest attempt&mdash;and in large part a successful attempt&mdash;to up&hyphen;skill the work force in Australia for what was obviously going to be the most important restructuring of employment and the nature of employment in this country that we have seen in the last 20 years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as the government wants to go back to other times, I will do that very quickly. I well remember what happened in 1982, in the dying days of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government, when the Prime Minister at that time decided he wanted to have an early election. What he did was to bring in a budget that he knew was only going to last a few months. In fact, in the last couple of months of 1982 and early in 1983 we had double&hyphen;digit unemployment. Indeed, we got there at a very fast rate. I must say that the other thing we had was almost 11 per cent inflation. If the government senators want to start talking about some of the record on this, they need to get that part of the record straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited in 1983 a dollar with the skids well and truly underneath it. There was a massive depreciation of the currency throughout the course of 1982 and into 1983. The coalition could not, under Mr Howard, make a hard decision. That hard decision was to float the dollar so that it could find its proper level. But the policies that were put in place were only there temporarily so that Mr Fraser could have a poll at the end of 1982. Those plans did not work, and in 1983 a 13&hyphen;year period of Labor government started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that period of Labor government we saw unemployment come down quite substantially. We also saw for the first time ever surplus budgets in this country. We had been promised surplus budgets before but they were never delivered. With the great surpluses at the end of 1988, with the back of inflation broken, with unemployment coming well and truly down, with the participation rate going up&mdash;during the Fraser years there were large numbers of people who would have loved to have joined the work force but they gave up any hope of getting a job&mdash;with those indices right, the Hawke&hyphen;Keating years saw a greater participation rate than had taken place before.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For government senators to come in here to try to rewrite history over that 13&hyphen;year period&mdash;and in particular where the governments of the time had to deal with the fact that we needed to educate and train our work force for the new industries that were developing in this country, and they did so, and they did so well&mdash;really belies the fact that the conservatives in this country have ever understood what labour market reform is all about. The only thing they understand in that is to drive down wages so that they can get cheaper employment for the likes of Mr Moran and the others who put into their coffers at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be remiss here today if I did not say that last week I had hoped to get up and have a few words about the original motion that triggered this one. When the Democrats came in here last week they put up a motion which said that we were all as bad as each other; that, in fact, the Liberal government now is hopeless&mdash;I agreed with that; at least half of the motion was pretty good&mdash;and the Labor Party was not much better. I do not mind a bit of product differentiation if that is what they are about but, at the end of the day, as I said last week before I was gabbled up by all the government senators, as incompetent as this present bunch are, as incompetent as some of their ministers are, I think a few of them are trying to do something about the problem. Leastwise, some of their policies are not really quite as bad as a few I have seen, from time to time, floating around the electorate from those people who will probably never have control of the leavers which determine these particular questions.</PARA>

He circulated the Democrat election platform to all of the constituents in Kingston and said, `If you vote for Janine Haines this is what you are going to get.' He highlighted a few points in the platform, like, tax on the family home and a few things like that. Do you know what happened? The voters deserted them in droves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a couple of other occasions, particularly in recent times in South Australia, I have had dealings with the Democrats. I have not had a lot of experience with the Democrats up here but I have certainly had a lot with the three that are in the Legislative Council in South Australia. One of their programs was to do everything they could to end gaming machines in South Australia. That is one of the things I was involved in as a shadow minister. In fact, as I understand it, something of the order of 5,000 people who did not have a job before now have employment in the hospitality sector in South Australia. It may well be that some senators in here do not like gaming machines; I am one of them. I have never put 10c in one. But who am I to tell people what they should spend their money on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was dealing with this in South Australia, the Democrats came up to me and said, `Look, we want $20 million out of gaming machines to go and put on horseracing.' I said, `What are you talking about?' They said, `It's like this. We want you to use you numbers to squeeze the government's bill for tax so that we can get 20 million bucks'&mdash;which is a lot of money in South Australia&mdash;`and give it to the horseracing industry.' I was puzzled over that because I could not understand the difference&mdash;and I still cannot&mdash;between putting a couple of bob in a gaming machine and putting some money on a horse. No&hyphen;one has explained the difference to me except that there are 400,000 people in South

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, on behalf of my coalition colleagues I would like to welcome Senator Bartlett. It is a shame that he is not actually in the chamber this afternoon because this really is a pretty important topic. Senator Mackay has put up a pretty brave motion. I am not suggesting that Senator Mackay herself, personally, is hypocritical, because she follows the Labor line, but the motion smacks of such hypocrisy and such opportunism in circumstances where Labor's record has to be seen to be believed. The whole motion that has been brought forward this afternoon seems to proceed on the assumption that structural unemployment happened in a vacuum&mdash;it just dropped out of the ceiling and, there we are, we have had dreadful unemployment since the Howard government came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole motion is directed to blame and not solutions, even though there is a reference to the need to explore creative and practical solutions to the employment crisis. Of course, one of the problems about that is that everything that Labor stands for looks backwards to an age that no longer exists. It does not exist in an age where the economy is globalised, where there has been loss of jobs because a lot of industries have become obsolete and where one really does have to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look at fixing the economy before you can look at what initiatives and employment programs might address this problem that we have in this country and that is even worse in other countries throughout Europe and the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have with this motion is old Labor&mdash;the old Labor that we know so well. No wonder Senator Quirke did not want to go back to Labor's record. It is very difficult to see how anyone on the other side of this chamber could keep a straight face when advocating that somehow or other they addressed the problems of a loss of jobs that beset this country. Labor destroyed 420,000 full-time jobs during the `recession we had to have'. Full-time unemployment fell from 6.2 million in July 1990 to 5.8 million in November 1992. Young people fared even worse. The number of young people with full-time jobs halved. Full-time youth unemployment fell by approximately 240,000 from 465,000 in June 1989 to 227,000 in March 1994. These were the young people whom Mr Keating told to go and get a job. What an insult to people who were genuinely facing problems under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long-term unemployment trebled during the worst recession since the 1930s Depression. Long-term unemployment increased from 114,000 in November 1989 to 349,000 in July 1993. The unemployment average under Labor was 8.7 per cent during the 13 years that Labor had to fix this problem and to actually address the structural problems that beset this economy, and it did not fall below nine per cent from March 1991 to November 1994&mdash;nearly three years&mdash;and it peaked at 11 per cent. This is not a record to be proud of. This is not a record that can be defended under any circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at the manufacturing industry. The manufacturing sector was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs. During the time that Labor occupied the treasury bench, it showed no net employment growth at all. In fact, at the time the Howard government came to office, there were one million people out of work. To suggest that somehow or other you draw a line under this record and that the Howard government&mdash;or, indeed, any govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8495"> ment&mdash;has a magic wand to wave to redress this sort of structural problem and the long-term unemployment problem created by Labor is just untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the way to really look at improving employment is to get the economy into such a shape that new jobs are created and sustainable jobs are created. The government's scorecard on macro&hyphen;economic reform so far is pretty impressive. The budget deficit of $10.5 billion is under control and on track to achieving an underlying surplus. That is certainly no mean feat. Inflation in the last year is the lowest it has been for 30 years. Official interest rates have been reduced on five occasions since last July from 7.5 per cent to five per cent, and economic growth is projected to reach 3.75 per cent this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has undertaken a number of significant industry reforms in its first 18 months of office, which my colleague Senator Tierney detailed. Major changes have been made which will actually help to create the environment to let the economy grow stronger and let the economy grow for a sustained period so that jobs can be created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst government can take initiatives&mdash;I will get to those in a moment&mdash;they cannot actually create the jobs. So, until you fix these economic fundamentals&mdash;the environment to allow growth, the environment to allow new jobs to be created, the confidence to get the economy back on track and the confidence that business will actually take on new employees&mdash;jobs will not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic fundamentals also include fixing up and getting a more efficient tax system, a tax system that will actually deliver a lower rate of tax for business to encourage them to take on more employees and to do such things as fix the waterfront. That is something that has never been tackled by Labor. It is doing a lot to slow the economy because the waterfront is so slow. The turnaround on the waterfront is a national disgrace. It is important to identify and remove distortions that protect some sectors at the expense of others. This government is not in the business of business welfare and handouts; it is in the business of making the economy strong so that new jobs can be created.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has implemented many initiatives in its first 18 months. Just looking back at Working Nation that everybody over there touts as some great saviour program, that was Labor's response to the unemployment crisis. You have to say that, on any view, it was a dismal failure. Between July 1990 and March 1996, Labor's policies added only an additional 7,100 full-time jobs. That is pretty paltry. Many Working Nation programs simply did not lead to real jobs. For example, only 22 per cent of participants in the new work opportunities program ended up in unsubsidised employment, despite it costing over $10,000 per person to participate in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first became a senator in this place, I remember going to places such as Newcastle and Belmont in New South Wales to present certificates to graduates of the new work opportunities program. They were enthusiastic people who were keen about their skills and ready to offer themselves for employment. Guess what? They had no jobs to go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is a necessary scheme in a broader range of initiatives&mdash;it is only one&mdash;to tackle youth unemployment. That seems to be something that we have not got our heads around in this debate&mdash;that we have to look after young people. The whole of government approach and the work for the dole scheme have thrown up a lot of other initiatives to increase genuine job opportunities. The new national apprenticeship scheme will provide trainees with world-class skills, giving Australian businesses a competitive edge in the global economy. Another $1.3 billion has been allocated to vocational education and training in 1997. This is an increase of $144 million on funding provided in the last year of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To actually say that this government is not addressing the structural problems of unemployment is simply not to understand the economic fundamentals that are essential to create the environment to let new jobs be created. The new apprenticeships and traineeships will be in high growth industries such as technology, finance, tourism and hospitality, sport and the traditional trades.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8496">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The skills and qualifications of new apprentices and trainees will provide a skilled work force able to take up the jobs that will surely flow from the economy which is at last actually starting to show that new jobs and new opportunities will be able to be sustained. It will be easier for employers to actually hire apprentices. In the calendar year 1998, a total of $891 million will be provided for TAFE and other training providers through the Australian National Training Authority.

This has been wrongly interpreted as being the figure for net jobs lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that these retrenchments occurred, but this gives us only half the picture. These figures were more than offset by the creation of many new jobs, both full-time and part-time. In fact, during the Hawke and Keating governments over two million new jobs were created despite the fact that we did not inherit an economy which was in very good shape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that members of the coalition have made numerous remarks to the media&mdash;with great satisfaction, I might add&mdash;about the healthy state in which we left the economy. I wish that we could have said the same when we inherited the economy from the coalition in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition first took office, it had the benefit of inheriting an economy which had seen three years of economic growth averaging four per cent, inflation averaging 2.5 per cent and an unemployment rate which had dropped from 11 per cent to 8.5 per cent. We created 700,000 new jobs and were well on our way to achieving our medium&hyphen;term target unemployment rate of five per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to contrast this with the situation which the Labor Party inherited from the coalition. When the Hawke government was first elected, it came into office with an unemployment rate of 10 per cent, thanks to the Howard&hyphen;Fraser strategy of fighting inflation first, an inflation rate of over 10 per cent&mdash;so obviously they were not too successful at tackling that&mdash;and a country at industrial war with itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our strategy was different. We focused on jobs and people&mdash;not banks and profits. The number of jobs grew steadily during the boom period of the 1980s at a rate which was faster than that of other OECD countries. This of course was aided substantially by the Accord&mdash;the preparedness of the government of the day to manage the economy&mdash;and the creation of a whole range of specific initiatives, including a scheme of direct job creation called the community employment program, which was allocated $300 million to fund 70,000 full-time jobs of an average six-month duration on labour intensive projects of social and economic benefit to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to contrast this with the current government's approach. It does not believe it has an interventionist role to play in managing unemployment, except when the next election looms, when it will pull fists full of dollars out of a magic hat&mdash;and probably a few white rabbits as well&mdash;and use its slush fund to fool people into thinking that it is interested in job creation schemes which build public infrastructure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not believe that it has a role in managing and shaping economic change. It has some other funny beliefs and, I should say, prejudices. Mr Andrew, the member for Wakefield, has complained in the House that his phone rings almost as frequently with employers seeking workers as it does with the unemployed seeking work. I do not

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts of over $1.8 billion to the Working Nation programs are hardly likely to be offset in any meaningful way by $160 million over four years for the apprenticeship and traineeship scheme. These cuts are harming some of the most vulnerable in our community&mdash;the young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation was one of the most comprehensive labour market programs ever put forward by a government in Australia. It was piloted, tested and proved to be successful. Also, it was targeted at all people so that you could get access to a program if you were young, older, female, an indigenous person or from a non&hyphen;English speaking background. I am very proud of the inclusive nature of those programs which, unlike the work for the dole scheme&mdash;although it does sound like heresy to raise them in the same sentence&mdash;did not target and punish the young unemployed. The youth training initiative, case management and the job compact offered real opportunities for the young, long&hyphen;term unemployed to get out of that cycle of unemployment and lack of experience, coupled with poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed fell every month for 32 months. I would like to contrast this with the increase of 58,000 in the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed that has occurred since May 1996 due to the freezes and then cuts to many Working Nation programs. These so&hyphen;called industrial relations reforms, touted by the government as the panacea for solving all our economic and industry ills, have so far been spectacularly unsuccessful at addressing unemployment problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a simple truism that governments must exercise fiscal responsibility to provide economic growth and job promotion. If ever we needed proof, the volatility of the stock market worldwide this week shows just that. While we did not escape the impact of the falls, Australia has come out of the turbulence in good shape. Share prices have recovered, confidence is returning and companies just this day are talking about future economic plans. This week's events, taken with the instability of several South-East Asian economies, underlines the key point that, without a stable, low inflation economy, our country, which is commodity based, is particularly vulnerable to economic movements worldwide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Costello) told parliament that the Australian economy has sound macro&hyphen;economic fundamentals of low inflation, high productivity growth and high profitability. He said we would have been in a far more exposed position had the government not put in place plans to rescue Australia's fiscal position. A healthy economy is the No. 1 goal of this government. The opposition talks about setting targets, as it did in question time today. The target that we have set ourselves is a sound foundation, sound 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> building blocks, which is the most important target that any government can have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into office, the Commonwealth's underlying budget deficit was over $10 billion. Budget deficits over the last five years of the previous government had totalled $70 billion, driving the general Commonwealth government net debt from $17 billion in 1991 to $93 billion five years later. What a legacy. Labor simply were economic profligates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now been in office just 19 months, but already the measures we have put in place to provide for the budget to move into underlying surplus by 1998 have been seen. It is a massive turnaround. By taking responsibility for the economy and correcting the fundamentals that Labor ignored, we have laid the foundations for job growth. We are pushing that growth on several fronts: with creative approaches to unemployment and youth unemployment, such as work for the dole and Green Corps; with the increased emphasis on exports; with initiatives like the supermarket to Asia; by encouraging savings and investment; by reforming workplace industrial relations so that business and small business can feel able to take on more staff; and by tackling some areas that the Labor Party in its 13 years of office did not get around to, like the waterfront&mdash;or did not get around to honestly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last night the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, had three hours of constructive talks with union leaders. It is a great step in the right direction to see that that cooperative workplace is being attempted. The government is committed to improving productivity on the waterfront, which will secure the jobs of waterfront workers, boost export income and then provide a whole lot of other Australians with jobs. The Labor Party claim that we have done nothing about unemployment, that we do not care about people out of work, is completely unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thought that Labor have a mortgage on caring for those people who are unemployed is just plain wrong. Labor have nothing to crow about when it comes to creating jobs. Throughout their last year of office, employment hovered at around 8.4 per cent. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8499"> also have the distinction of delivering the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, and that was 11.2 per cent in December 1982. In fact, for nine months in 1992 and 1993 unemployment stayed at 11 per cent or over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach to unemployment was pretty straightforward: `If you can't get a job, don't worry about it. The government will fudge something for you. You can apply for the dole and get onto a program like Working Nation.' This meant that you would get some training but you would still go without a job. The long-term unemployed were given no encouragement by the previous Labor government to find work. DEETYA's evaluation of Labor's Working Nation program revealed that the share of market assistance to long-term unemployed people actually fell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation under Labor churned the unemployed through at a massive rate, but it was entirely a cosmetic solution. By contrast, by May 1998 we will have replaced Labor's failed labour market assistance programs with a new employment services market. In this market employment placement companies will receive full payment only if they deliver results. While Labor impliedly accepted that it could not reduce unemployment and tinkered at finding ways to create work, Australia's social security bill went through the roof. It was typical of Labor's credit card approach to the economy: just book it up; don't worry about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with the coalition's approach. This afternoon the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, said that, through the efforts of her department and improved compliance measures, this government is now saving $28 million a week from people who were not entitled to certain amounts of social welfare.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is excellent news because it makes more money available for those who genuine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly need assistance. It also makes a mockery of the ALP's claim that there was no room for improvement in this area. This government is not afraid to put in the hard yards to generate jobs and wealth through proper productivity, a more sound economy and more mainstream procedures for small business. We are tackling the problems like unfair dismissal, our antiquated taxation system and competition reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we come to the big winner: interest rates. This has been the single most important achievement of this government's term so far. The benefits of low interest rates flow to almost every part of the economy. Inflation, at virtually zero, is at a 30-year low. It has never been so low since 1969. This government is committed to low inflation. Low inflation encourages people to save and invest, it boosts confidence and it aids those who are making long-term decisions. Low interest rates and low inflation assist businesses to make sound investment decisions and underpin the creation of new and lasting job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay, I am pleased that you have re-entered the chamber, because we have come from your so&hyphen;called banana republic to a country with a solid and robust economy today, a country that can start to look itself in the face in the approach taken to fiscal responsibility and fiscal consolidation. This has been clearly demonstrated this week. As the stock market roller&hyphen;coaster travelled around the world, Australia withstood the bumps, and we will continue to do so because this government faces reality in a way that the Labor government never could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will admit that the inevitable process of structural reform is not something new to us. It was a problem that the previous government faced as well. Structural adjustment in the economy is here to stay, whether you like it or not, but economic changes which all countries face and which Australia is facing bring opportunities. Those opportunities have to be recognised by business, and they have to be encouraged by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is government that must put in place the methods by which economies can grow and adapt. It is a shared responsibility. It always 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8500"> interests me when companies say that they have a right to put people off but that it is the government's responsibility alone to create jobs. Governments never create jobs. I understand, for instance, that the proposed merger of the Bank of Melbourne and Westpac may cause up to 750 job losses this year. I understand that, over the last three years, around 15,000 jobs have been lost in the banking industry as its operations have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that there is probably the same number of people employed in banking now as there was in 1949. There has been massive structural adjustment in that industry, and it is a shared responsibility of banks and government to provide the sorts of incentives needed for the economy to grow. It is not always the right of companies to put people off and then say that it is the responsibility of governments to create jobs. It is a shared responsibility; it is a responsibility which this government takes up and will continue to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion because, quite clearly, the government have done nothing to affect the unemployment rate, particularly the long&hyphen;term unemployment rate, in this nation. That is the essence of what we are talking about here this afternoon. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, if you look at the people who have been unemployed for between 52 weeks and 104 weeks in a year, you see that the number in August 1996 has gone from 99,700 to 105,500. Quite clearly, there has been an increase in the number of people who are long-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the other category&mdash;that is, people who are unemployed for 104 weeks and over, and do not forget that is two years or more&mdash;one will see that the number has gone from 119,600 to 129,800. So in both categories, those that are unemployed between 52 weeks and 104 weeks and those unemployed more than 104 weeks, the numbers have escalated in the time of this government&mdash;between August 1996 and August 1997. The government has had at its disposal the right to remedy the situation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What one sees is that the long&hyphen;term unemployed figure as a proportion of the total unemployed figure has gone from 28.4 per cent to 30.8 per cent. The long&hyphen;term unemployment problem has worsened during the period of this government. We are not seeing any improvement. This is where the problem lies. The fact is that the battlers, the people that the government so firmly and squarely claimed they were going in to represent, have not been given the promised wonderland that was painted for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one turns to table 27 in the ABS statistics of August 1997, one sees another situation. If one looks at who are the people most affected in this long&hyphen;term unemployed area, one will find that it is the older people, the people who are finding it toughest and hardest to secure employment. If one looks particularly at the males in that area, one finds that, in the group between 25 years of age and 34 years of age who have been unemployed for 52 weeks or more, there are some 36,900 males. In the age bracket 35 to 54 years of age, there are 55,100 who have been unemployed for 52 weeks or more. This is the real nub of the argument. The fact is that the government have done nothing to turn these numbers around. We are not talking about comparisons with the period of the Labor government; we are talking about what the government have had firmly and squarely in their own control to do something about, and clearly nothing has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same problem exists for females in that bracket of being unemployed for 52 weeks and over. Again one finds a disproportionate number of women fitting into the categories 25 to 34 years of age or 35 to 54 years of age. That is some 20,600 in the first group and 37,100 in the second group. So we are finding that the government have not addressed this issue at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one then looks at regional unemployment, one will find that this is part of the reason why the government does not know how to handle the problem. If you look at ABS regional unemployment statistics&mdash;and I will look at just a couple of areas in Queensland, again rural and regional areas which this government prides itself as doing something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8501"> for&mdash;you find that in the south and east Moreton statistical region the unemployment rate is 9.8 per cent; north and west Moreton, 11.9 per cent; Wide Bay and Burnett, 12.7 per cent; Darling Downs and south&hyphen;west regional, 5.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government might claim some sort of victory there, but it is a pyrrhic victory because the people in the bush are leaving the bush because they cannot get jobs. That is why the figures are down there. The Mackay&hyphen;Fitzroy&hyphen;central west statistical region is 9.8 per cent. It does not matter where you look; you are looking at a rate which is well in excess of the national average&mdash;the national average being in the order of 8.6 per cent. We find that the government have turned a blind eye to the people that they claimed they were going to help, the people that are in most need of help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the situation for young people, you will see that the calamity persists. Let us look at the Queensland area again. The 15- to 19-year-old full-time unemployment rate in the Brisbane inner ring is 25.9 per cent; the outer ring is 30.5 per cent; the south and east Brisbane balance, 34.5 per cent; and the north and west Brisbane balance, 36.7 per cent. In relation to some of the country regions: in north and west Moreton it is 45.5 per cent; Wide Bay and Burnett, 38.1 per cent; the Darling Downs and south west, 18.4 per cent; and Mackay&hyphen;Fitzroy&hyphen;central west, 42.2 per cent. If you look, you will see that the unemployment rate for young people is disproportionate to even the national average in those areas, and again this government have done nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government have tried to solve the unemployment problem by reducing the participation rate. Of course, the participation rate continues to fall. The only answer that the government can try to give us is, `Small business will create the jobs.' That is just complete and utter nonsense. If you look at what government have done to small business, you will see that they have given small business an economy that is flat and where there is little or no growth. Small business cannot take up the slack in labour that exists out there. So we clearly have a government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that do not know where they are going. This to me was totally epitomised by an ad that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 12 April. It is headed `Public sector career opportunities including graduate careers'. The note down the bottom is of particular interest, because it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please note that competition for positions in the Public Sector is very strong. Nationally, it is expected that over 100,000 people will express initial interest. In the 1995/96 financial year fewer than 2,000 non graduate permanent positions were filled. Of up to 10,000 graduates expected to sit the test, it is expected around 300&hyphen;400 will obtain permanent positions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this is a government that feign an interest in employment and an interest in young people&mdash;and here they are saying that, at most, 300 to 400 people will get permanent positions out of the 10,000 expected to sit the test. They go on further to say that in Queensland some 4,600 candidates sat for the former administrative services test, with less than 200 being placed during 1996 in a very limited number of departments. So they paint the picture clearly themselves. There is no doubt that it is beyond anyone's reasonable consideration that this government are doing anything to address the issue of long-term unemployment, because the statistics clearly show that, and anything about youth unemployment, because quite clearly they are just not interested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here, at a time when there is growth in the economy, we are seeing all the signs of a recession. We are seeing downsizing in companies. We are seeing unemployment either rising or remaining steady; if there is any fall, it can be explained by seasonal factors&mdash;and seasonal factors alone. What we have are the hallmarks of a recession, with a government claiming that they are a government of growth, that they are a government of creation of jobs. Of course, this purely is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, what we have is a government who have lost the plot. With the people they claimed they were going to represent, they have failed miserably. The only thing that can be taken for granted in this nation is that the only people who will represent the battlers in a fair and equitable way are those in the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Results from a survey by the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce in May of this year asked small business if the prospect of unfair dismissal laws discouraged them from adding on staff. Fifty&hyphen;six per cent said `yes'. That is a resounding `yes' for our coalition reforms. Those unfair dismissal laws have intimidated thousands of employers around Australia and deterred them from taking on more staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had Labor and the minor parties supported the government last week, they would have shown the Australian people that this parliament is serious about employment and Australia's future. They would have shown the people of Australia that they were prepared to support the government for the sake of those people who feel disillusioned and disaffected out there&mdash;some who are second and perhaps third generation unemployed. It is a message much needed by the community that we want to help the unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember when apprenticeships were the path to lasting jobs? Yet in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the work force, was at its lowest level in 30 years. The government is doing something about it. In August, the minister announced $550 million for at least 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships over the next two years. That is a 48 per cent increase in job opportunities for our youth. We are providing major benefits to young people, employers and, ultimately, the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refresh people's memories. In December 1992, at the height of `the recession we had to have'&mdash;brought on by Captain Wacky, your leader of the past&mdash;the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to the historically high level of 11.2 per cent. Senator Lundy, you are as bad as Clyde Cameron. You would not remember Clyde Cameron. Senator Stott&hyphen;Despoja might; she is a student of politics. I guess you are a rower and a bricklayer. Clyde Cameron used to come into this place and bag hell out of the government of the time. He then got into government and produced record unemployment. He said that the worst decision he made in his career as the labour minister was to introduce holiday leave loading. He said that it was the worst decision that he had made in his career&mdash;and I am pleased to see that Senator Chris Evans acknowledges that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One million Australians were out of work under Paul Keating in any one given month&mdash;more than ever previously recorded. Long&hyphen;term unemployment reached a historical peak of 349,000 in July 1993. Unemployment has been unacceptably high for well over a decade. For nine of the 13 financial years between 1983&hyphen;84 and 1996&hyphen;97, the trend&hyphen;averaged annual unemployment rate exceeded eight per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour market began to weaken in the first half of 1995. This led to growth in short&hyphen;term unemployment which ultimately fed into the long&hyphen;term unemployment growth which we have seen since May 1996. Long&hyphen;term 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment increased by 1.5 per cent to 256,000 in September 1997; that is a trend. Over the last eight months, however, short&hyphen;term unemployment numbers have been declining, and the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed in the 52&hyphen; to 104&hyphen;week category is beginning to stabilise. This augurs well for a slowdown in growth for overall long&hyphen;term unemployment numbers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why Senator Heffernan would get so passionate and feel so emotional about the particular issue before us today. There is, however, no excuse for him to get personal on this issue, denouncing me as a media guru. His reference to Senator Lundy's photograph in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  today as `glamorous' was perhaps not such a negative inference, but lecturing us or telling us that we are not necessarily politicians or that we have not had enough life experience&mdash;whatever the inferences were&mdash;does not get us much further in this debate. I only wish that the honourable senator would apply the same passion and vigour to the debate about unemployment. For the record, it is not befitting of Senator Heffernan because normally he is not personal; normally he is a lot fairer in his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for his comments in relation to the unfair dismissal law, I am afraid I cannot let that go. How dare he make such claims for that contrived piece of legislation? It was contrived merely for the purposes of bringing on a double dissolution&mdash;that is my opinion and that of my party&mdash;and has no substantiation with either facts and figures or anecdotal evidence. In fact, all the statistics that were brought to this chamber pointed to this law being an unnecessary and unfair piece of legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We knew that unfair dismissal claims on a national or a federal level were down by 52 per cent, and most of those claims related to big business. We knew that on state and territory levels they were down by roughly 20 per cent. So we have had no sufficient substantiation from this government for introducing those exemptions for small business from the unfair dismissal laws that we opposed for very good reasons last week. If the other side of the chamber wants to know why small business is not necessarily hiring or taking on new employees, it is because they, like many other people in this community, do not have confidence in our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would not be surprised to see some of the reasons that small business gives for not hiring more employees. It is certainly not the unfair dismissal laws. They are certainly not calling for an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal laws. When we survey small business, when we look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> survey of small business, what do we see? More than 50 per cent say that they believe the economy is either in recession or at a standstill. That is why they are not taking on more employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Senator Heffernan's reference to interest rates, the interjection that I made in the chamber was not that interest rates do not matter&mdash;quite the contrary. I am just sick and tired of hearing this government bleat about lower interest rates and low inflation as some kind of panacea to the problem we have with our economy, with our growth rates&mdash;or lack of them&mdash;and with our unemployment rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wonder why the Reserve Bank stepped in and lowered interest rates. They had to do something to get our economy moving, because not a lot of growth is happening. If we look at Treasurer Costello's forecast from last year, we see that the government was anticipating that growth would be around 3.7 per cent by June 1997. It was actually 3.25 per cent. So much for the government's estimates of what growth would be. We do not see much happening on the manufacturing side either. I was not for a minute suggesting that interest rates are not important. They are fundamentally important, but lower interest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rates are not necessarily an indicator that our economy is alive and well. Our economy certainly is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only the current government has failed to address the issue of unemployment; the former government, I and my party believe, has too. Any attempt to have a meaningful discussion about employment in this place has failed. We only have to look at last week's urgency debate, brought on by the acting leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, where we tried to debate this issue. Not only did we not debate the issue; the two old parties spent the afternoon filibustering, moving to suspend standing orders and scoring political points in an attempt to delay this debate. That was more offensive than usual because it took place against the backdrop of a series of articles by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which pointed out quite soberingly and starkly that 3.3 million jobs had been abolished in Australia over the past decade. That includes 550,000 jobs lost under the coalition government. The record of this government and of the former government is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly we are seeing a lack of full&hyphen;time jobs and the casualisation of the work force. We are seeing no attempts by this government to inject money where it counts. That means looking after specifically targeted, successful labour market programs. It means looking at how we can retrain and skill and develop our workers so that they can compete in a changing work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not seem to be acknowledged very often, either by the former government or by the current government, that our work force has fundamentally changed. People are going to need skills and training in order to enter into and compete in a changed work force. We know that entry level jobs have diminished. We know that those traditional jobs that young people have occupied have gone. Yet I see no moves by this government to invest in jobs that are sustainable, meaningful and long term. That requires an economic commitment and an economic stimulus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the contrary. I hear the former minister for employment, Senator Vanstone, relying on some kind of McDonald's led recovery. There is the idea that people can go into low skilled, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8506"> low value jobs&mdash;that, regardless of their professional inclination or qualifications, young people should take jobs at McDonald's. That is not even the point. There are not enough fries to go around for the 90,000&hyphen;odd young people who do not have a job in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen from the government? We have seen a Green Corps, but, depending who you ask, that is not actually a job creation program. You bet it is not a job creation program&mdash;it is not creating any jobs that I have seen. Over three years, 3,500 places does not even come close to matching the 75,000 potential labour market program places provided through REAP, LEAP, land care and regional employment programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the work for the dole scheme. In her contribution, Senator Coonan suggested that was one way of instilling skills and what have you in young unemployed Australians. It is a compulsory scheme. I cannot see how that is instilling the dignity and motivation this government claims young people lack so badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also misses the fundamental point: not one new job is being created by the work for the dole program. Much of the money being used to fund such a program has been cut from valuable labour market programs run under the former government. The Democrats would be the first to agree that there is no point in having labour market programs unless they are specifically targeted and appropriately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has done is to cut the successful schemes that operated under the former government's Working Nation program. I nominate Skillshare and NEIS as two of the obvious ones that had successful outcomes and successful rates. Yet they were cut or completely defunded. Cuts of $1.7 billion over two years to labour market programs are inexcusable and contrary to the direction in which we should be heading, given the changing nature of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has this government cut funding to labour market programs. It has also cut $1.8 billion out of higher education. Higher education is an area which makes money for the government. We make more out of higher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education exports in this country than we do out of wheat sales. Yet we are undermining that sector with cuts to quality research and education at a higher education level. There have been cuts of $1.8 billion to that sector over three years. About $50 million a year is my estimate of the amount that has been cut out of the vocational education and training area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TAFE and the higher education sector are not the only victims. What about those institutions that foster training and education research&mdash;CSIRO and other educational institutions? They are the very institutions that will be responsible for not only solving the problems of today but also finding the solutions to the problems of tomorrow, whether those relate to the environment, to health or to something else. They are also the areas in which we should be targeting our wealth, ensuring that we do have sustainable and meaningful jobs for the future. CRCs, the Energy Research and Development Corporation and all those areas are the keys to ensuring that we not only have an educated work force and an enlightened and democratic community but also that we are investing in future technologies for tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I commend the motion but acknowledge that it has not only been this government that has failed to address the issue of unemployment but the former government as well. I would like to take these few seconds to congratulate the Democrats' latest addition, Senator Andrew Bartlett from Queensland, a man who is passionately committed not only to the issue of solving unemployment but to social justice. He is also clever enough to make the connection between environmental protection and employment creation. I welcome him to this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating the issue of unfair dismissal. We heard many panaceas to the problems of the country when this government got elected.

There were about 50,000; every week there was a new announcement&mdash;we had to have something that was the next solution to the country's problems.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many occasions I can recall the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, saying, `Workers can only do better under us. You can never do worse, you can only do better.' I bet there are a lot of workers out there thinking, `I wonder what that "better" meant? What did it actually mean in terms of us?' So many of them have lost their jobs, whether they be in the public or private sector. My own state was promised so much by this government in so far as expenditure and support, but what have we seen? Here again the other day we saw the government vote down an amendment to the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 &mdash;an amendment proposed by us that would have very much assisted our state and, in particular, a region of our state that has unemployment in excess of 20 per cent. You voted that down. If ever the people of Australia had an indication to them that you people in government had totally misled them on all of the promises that you made, that was a really good example.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat of a shame also that we revisit this issue after the Senate has just shamelessly rejected our amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. My colleague Senator Abetz last week raised the issue of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>headed, `Opportunity lost: dismissal law refusal trims hair salon jobs'. I wish to again draw the Senate's attention to that article, because I think it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8509"> a most important one and is indicative of the way many small businesses around this country are feeling.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hairdresser Vicki McFarlane was ready to take on two new staff members at her Parramatta salon in time for Christmas. But when Opposition MPs in Canberra scuppered changes to the unfair dismissal laws on Tuesday, Ms McFarlane decided it was just not worth the risk. "We feel betrayed by what the Senate has done," she said yesterday. "We can't grow&mdash;we need more people but we can't afford to put them on without the laws being changed."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is shameful, and there are two people in Parramatta who do not have jobs because, Senator Lundy, of the Labor Party's position on this important amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, if we needed more proof, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 23 October there is an article in which the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce chief executive, Ms Katie Lahey, is reported as rejecting the claim by the federal opposition that no independent research proving business concern on the issue exists. The chamber said that when it surveyed 800 small businesses in May and asked if the prospect of such claims discouraged them from adding staff, 56 per cent said yes. Her comments were supported by the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Mr Rob Bastian. He claimed that at least 50,000 jobs could be created by the exemption, and yet the opposition and the Australian Democrats have the audacity to come into this chamber and suggest that there is no evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is an important issue. As I say, it is the second time this chamber has considered it within a week. I am very concerned that the ALP in opposition declines to take responsibility for the unemployment problem that occurred under their 13 years of mismanagement of this country. I am frankly astonished at how you can sleep at night, because after 13 years you left us an economy that was basically in desperate need of some sound economic and financial management.</PARA>

Jobs are our No. 1 priority. I am proud to be a member of a government for which jobs are a No. 1 priority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, it shows Senator Lundy's lack of respect for this very important issue. Sure, the Labor government spent money on the problem. Labor governments are good at spending money, aren't they? They do not fix the problem, they do not address the underlying causes of the problem and they do not even recognise the issues&mdash;but they spend money. The ALP spent $2.7 billion on labour market programs in 1995&hyphen;96, a time during which the unemployment rate rose. Fascinating, isn't it? Labor's labour market programs did not work. For example, take jobstart: in 1995 more than 50 per cent of the participants of jobstart remained unemployed three months after completing the course. I have recently had an analysis presented to me that suggests the real success rate of jobstart, when you measure it against a control group, was 28 per cent. Almost a quarter of those people had taken part in previous training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have ever talked to unemployed people, Senator Lundy, you would hear them talk about the training merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round that they were on under Labor. Unemployed? Do a computer course. Done a computer course? Do a forklifting course. Done a forklifting course? Do a horticultural course. Done a horticultural course? Do a hospitality course. Done a hospitality course? Do a tourism course. That was all it was&mdash;a training merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round. That Labor considers that it has any credibility in this debate astonishes me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would prefer to focus on the positive things our government is doing. The Democrats said it very well themselves when they said&mdash;also in their unemployment issues paper&mdash;that the Working Nation program was not about creating new jobs but reshuffling the unemployed. What an indictment!</PARA>

This is the government, I hasten to remind people, that is trying to pick up the pieces&mdash;the legacy left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to listen to the contribution of Senator Gibbs. She is a very nice-hearted person, but her contribution was utterly irrelevant. She was accusing this government of squandering the money that the Labor Party had saved. In their last year of office alone, their savings were negative $10 billion. They had gone into debt. This is how irrelevant the Labor Party is. They do not even know their own track record. Their track record is of massive spending for nil result. That is the legacy of the Labor Party and that is why those people sitting opposite are in opposition and are no longer on the government benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has a different view. This government believes that we have to get the economy right.

Senator Carr was part of the Labor Party that came up with the jobs ready strategy. The only person in Australia who was really job ready was Bill Hunter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority's annual report for 1996-97. It is certainly refreshing to be able to rise to discuss a most important issue&mdash;that is, public safety and food hygiene&mdash;rather than have the scenario that we witnessed only a few moments ago from Senator O'Chee who, when real business comes on, such as reports and government documents, flies the coop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia New Zealand Food Authority is a most important body charged with a range of functions which can be summed up in this way: it is the body responsible for ensuring the safety of food that we in Australia and New Zealand produce and consume. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The functions of the authority are set out in detail in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They include, for instance, reviewing the food standards code; developing nationally uniform food acts in association with the states and territories; developing nationally consistent food hygiene standards; developing nationally consistent arrangements for food surveillance and for the notification of food businesses; and reviewing food regulations. That might sound like a bit of bureaucratese but, in summary, this organisation is at the heart of ensuring public safety, and the health of the community when it comes to the food they consume and the food products that are produced in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure other senators are as concerned as I am&mdash;I know this issue crosses political boundaries&mdash;about the outbreaks, particularly in the last couple of years, of certain viruses associated with food products. There is an increasing concern in the Australian community about food safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure the Australian community that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority continues to strive to ensure the highest possible standards of food hygiene in this country. But every now and again, as we have seen in recent times, incidents arise such as the Garibaldi meat episode in South Australia and that which occurred not so long ago because of some contaminated food on an aircraft. Occasionally incidents of a serious nature arise and cause us to stop and take stock and ensure the regulations we have in place will continue to ensure that food safety, food hygiene, is maintained at a high standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia New Zealand Food Authority is currently going through a process of restructuring. I understand legislation is to come before this chamber, if not later this year then certainly next year, which relates to future mechanisms whereby companies in Australia may be charged a fee for seeking from the Australia New Zealand Food Authority the establishment of a food standard. This is a new development and something which has never occurred in the past. We in the opposition will, when the time comes, express our concerns about that process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8515">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, food hygiene, food safety and consumer confidence are issues of public concern. They are not and should never be put into that basket of things this government seems to think should be subject to the user&hyphen;pays principle; that is, companies should not be required to pay substantial sums of money simply to make an application to the authority to have a particular food product tested and then approved if it meets the appropriate standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an issue to be debated on another occasion. I do recommend to senators that they read the annual report. It spells out in great detail the work that has been done by the authority over the last 12 months. In an era of increasing international trade and transport, this is most important work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks tonight about the report of the Nuclear Safety Bureau for the period 1 April 1997 to 30 June 1997. My interest in uranium, mining and matters that derive from them has developed from my participation in the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling, which gave a report some three months ago after an inquiry that went for three months and which toured a number of proposed uranium sites in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting facets of that inquiry was the number of highly interesting, technical and scientific submissions made by a number of organisations, including the Nuclear Safety Bureau, the Australian Radiation Laboratories and the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Nuclear Safety Bureau, the agency under discussion this evening, is required under the act of parliament that established it to table a report every quarter to the parliament, which it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The function of the Nuclear Safety Bureau is primarily twofold: firstly to monitor and review the safety of any nuclear plant owned 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or operated by ANSTO in this country; and, secondly, to provide technical advice to the Commonwealth on the safety of nuclear plants and related matters. The ANSTO plant in Australia consists of two nuclear reactors&mdash;firstly the HIFAR, which is an acronym for high flux Australian reactor, and Moata, which is an associated plant used in university research facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the discussion in the quarterly report on HIFAR's operations, three issues of concern arose. Firstly, the bureau reported that seven abnormal occurrences were reported to the NSB for the quarterly period under review. Those abnormal occurrences were reviewed, and it was concluded that none had any adverse safety implications. The seven abnormalities&mdash;four were due to equipment fault; one to human factors; and two were somewhat acutely described as `other', and no further detail was offered&mdash;were investigated and were designated level zero: they were of no safety significance to the Nuclear Safety Bureau and, indeed, the surrounding public community. That obviously is a pleasing development, and one hopes that that excellent record continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second issue that arose from the quarterly report was the audit of radioactive discharge from the HIFAR plant. That audit review was conducted by the National Safety Bureau, Australian Radiation Laboratories and the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It analysed discharge monitoring and dose assessments that were conducted. The radiation doses to staff and public due to discharges were well within the annual limits recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. So the discharges that occurred were well within the official recommendations, which are based upon international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a concern about the audit of radioactive discharge. That is, the HIFAR operation was found not to comply with the audit criteria for, firstly, the documentation of procedures and instructions and, secondly, the validation of monitoring methods. So, whilst the audit found that the discharge did not breach Australian regulations based upon international standards, it did find that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8516"> practices of the organisation in respect of the documentation of procedures and instructions and the validation of monitoring methods at best left something to be desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Safety Bureau has covered the actions proposed by ANSTO to overcome that identified deficiency, but it does not cover all of the issues raised in the audit. As a response, the National Safety Bureau has put in writing a request that an amended action plan be submitted for this agreement. One presumes that that action plan will be implemented and that further reports will be made in the quarterly reports that are tabled in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue that arose was the safety arrangements at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre. On page 5, the bureau says that it has concerns over the issue of criticality exemption certificates for facilities which contain fissile material and remains to be satisfied that the new arrangements adequately address the role of the NSB in monitoring and reviewing nuclear plants operated by ANSTO. So, once again, the report identifies a concern and issues a caution in respect of that plant located at Lucas Heights. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take note of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on southern Africa and the government's response to the recommendations of the committee. Since the national elections in South Africa in 1993 and the lifting of sanctions in 1994, the commercial aspects of the bilateral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relationship with South Africa have become the dominant element of the relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians generally have a positive image of, and goodwill towards, South Africa and its President, Nelson Mandela. This has come through our connections in sport&mdash;mainly rugby and certainly cricket. Similarly, Australia is highly regarded within South Africa, particularly in the African National Congress, because of our strong stance against apartheid and especially because of the role played by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Not only was he an eminent person; he had a particular connection with President Nelson Mandela. Having been there recently, I find it interesting that he visited Nelson Mandela on Robbeneiland at least twice, maybe three times, during his 27 years on the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's wide experience on issues from public sector reform, information technology and social development to sports management are seen by the South Africans as world's best practice. Assistance has been provided in all aspects of South African life, from the management of their elections in 1993 to things that are very pertinent to both our countries, namely areas of land management. They are suffering, as we are, from the effects of El Nino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was in South Africa last month, I met the minister for water resources, who was looking for particular expertise in land and water management. He made the point that he was going to approach the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to get the sort of technical assistance that was important for their development. South Africa has enormous water problems with supply to domestic users, and they are putting up about 1,000 houses a day. They also have enormous problems with land management, and they are addressing those problems. In these sorts of areas, Australia is in a position to be of assistance, and we continue to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As South Africa takes its place in the international community, it will increasingly compete against Australia for commercial markets. Australian business will need to look to engage with South African business to define areas of complementary interest, particularly in the emerging third markets in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8517"> southern Africa and the gulf states in Asia. A lot of Australian business goes through South Africa when it goes to other parts of Africa. This will continue to be the case. Obviously our commercial links will be strengthened because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of areas of growth in the relationship which this report addresses. We have begun negotiating an extradition and mutual assistance treaty. We will begin the second round of negotiating the double tax treaty in September of this year. Those discussions are progressing pretty well. Discussions are also under way for negotiating an investment promotion and protection agreement. Our annual exports to South Africa have more than trebled over the last five years, and in 1996 they reached just under $1,000 million. South Africa is now Australia's 19th biggest export market, and significant opportunities exist for Australian exporters of materials, equipment, technology and services, education, health, mining, transport, building, processed foods, telecommunications and information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of South African tourists visiting Australia is about 40,000, and that number is increasing all the time. Government to government cooperation continues to expand and strengthen in almost every area that is possible. South Africa continues to be a major source of skilled migrants to Australia. In the last full year where records are up to date, 3,000 people came to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are developing an increasing dialogue with South Africa across a range of multilateral issues&mdash;for example, on disarmament, arms control and the environment. It is an important relationship. It is not a new one, but we have reached a new stage in our relationship. It is a complementary relationship. I commend the recommendations of the joint committee report, many of which have been taken up by the government. I hope that links with a fellow Commonwealth country will continue to grow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report as a member of the committee. I have spoken briefly to this report previously, but it seems to me that the report is one that should not be underestimated by the government and one that should be given fairly weighty consideration. The committee received a substantial number of submissions to start off with&mdash;118&mdash;and hearings took place across the width and breadth of Australia. We had submissions from various interest groups, from academics, from government and from government departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What came to my mind in hearing the evidence that came before the committee was the economic cost to our nation through marine pollution and coastal pollution. I think the costs that are involved are underestimated. When we were in Ballina, we heard evidence on the impact of acid sulfate soils leaching into the rivers and thereby destroying fish stock or making the fish that finally reached some degree of maturity totally unusable if caught for commercial or even recreational purposes. We found that the fish had a disease called red spot, which made them inedible. It attacked their flesh, under their scales. The cost to the fishermen in the area was quite substantial. In some instances, from recollection, it was estimated that up to 25 per cent of their catch would have to be thrown back as a result of the attack from the acid sulfate soils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a cost to the industry. It is a cost to the fishermen in that area. It is a cost to the production. If one does not redress these problems, then one places at risk these industries in the longer term. So I was particularly interested in the economic impact that such problems hold for our society. I believe that in many instances the economic impact is not measured, because it is difficult to measure. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8518"> If it is measured, it is underestimated, or it is a problem that occurs over a long period and therefore the economic impact is ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This to me is one of the unfortunate aspects that I think happened in the inquiry. Whilst we recognise that there are economic downsides to marine pollution and coastal pollution, they are not well documented. Pollution does impact, though, on the outcomes in the coastal and the river communities, and it should not be underestimated. Invariably we heard evidence to the effect that, if the problem could be fixed now, it would be so much cheaper to do so than to see the problem go on for a substantial number of years and then have to expend extraordinary amounts of money to remedy the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This gets down to the other issue that appealed to me in the committee inquiry, and that was the lack of base knowledge that we are in possession of to be able to test the actual degrading of our coastal river systems and our inland river systems, as well as the seas and so on. It really is something that we need to pay a great deal more attention to. Whilst we had evidence from a group in Port Phillip Bay on a very fine study that had been conducted into the Port Phillip Bay environs, and we were shown a model as to what would tip that ecosystem beyond some form of redemption and become an absolute ecological disaster, there are not a great number of these studies replicated throughout the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also saw the problem in the Derwent River. Again, part of the problem there is that we do not know when the starfish was introduced and we do not know just precisely what the state of the environment was before the starfish was introduced. We have a lack of understanding so that we can get a real measure of the extent of the disaster that we are confronted with. As I have said, this is one of my concerns arising out of the inquiry and, in particular, arising out of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a wide range of people who appeared before us. They were not panic merchants and they were not alarmists. They were putting to us a well&hyphen;reasoned, a well&hyphen;balanced and a very coherent case as to why we should pay more attention to our marine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment, not only because we are surrounded by water but also because we depend on water. The environment is very special to us. We need to address it in a sensible, practical manner and to address the problems that are confronting us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that was in the report was the issue of education. I have no doubt that until we can educate the people in our community&mdash;firstly, as to what the problems are; secondly, that in many instances some of them are the source of the problems; and, thirdly, that there are real remedies by reasonable practices in our society&mdash;then the problems are going to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it was not all disheartening in the committee's inquiry. We did have good evidence of people interested in monitoring the changing nature of the environment. Of course, the environment will just naturally change. But they were monitoring the unnecessary and degrading parts that contribute to the downgrading of our environment and, in turn, lead to some undesirable economic effects in our community. So the groups that we did hear from, the groups that we did meet, showed a real genuineness in taking the message out to the community at large. Many of them were community organisations and they showed a degree of responsibility that was second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something the government should support as a result of the report coming before the Senate. I commend the report to the government. I understand that there are a substantial number of recommendations, because we did canvass a wide-ranging issue. I believe that a speedy response from the government showing positive action in this area is undoubtedly warranted indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

I should get the record absolutely correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of problems that face Australia. One of those is ballast water discharge. As Senator Hogg and others who were on the committee would know, ballast water discharge is probably the cause of entry for most of the exotic species that have entered Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, we have in Port Phillip Bay toxic dinoflagellates. Toxic dinoflagellates&mdash;contrary to what some people believe&mdash;are not Democrats in swimming garb. Toxic dinoflagellates are a real danger because they can poison the shellfish and mussels and so on that are in these waters, as well as cause damage to the fish stocks. Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you have an interest in fish&mdash;although not necessarily those in the ocean.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT" NAMEID="10000">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those as well.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you would understand the problems that apply to these issues. One of the problems is that, once an exotic species becomes established in Australian waters, it can move from one port to another. So the problem is a double problem. Not only is it about protecting against new species that may be brought in in ballast water from overseas, but it is also about species that have gained a foothold in Australian waters and then moved, with coastal traffic, from once place to another. That is a real problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the government has taken steps to protect against the importation of exotic species through ballast water by imposing a levy. There is a bill before the chamber&mdash;I do not want to canvass it too much&mdash;which will impose a levy on ships visiting Australia so as to create, over two years, a fund of some $2 million to study the problems of ballast water discharge and how we deal with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, this is a real problem because there are some 1,100 ships that visit Queensland ports every year from overseas. Because they are bulk carriers, most of those are coming in under ballast. That is, they come to Queensland ports to pick up coal, sugar or, perhaps, alumina. So they constitute a threat to us because they must necessarily come in under ballast&mdash;and how they dispose of that ballast water is a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the millions and millions of tonnes of ballast water discharged in Queensland coastal waters close to the Barrier Reef every single year from those 1,100 ships. That is a real problem for the environment of Queensland&mdash;and I think Senator Hogg understands that problem, which is why he has taken an interest in the matter&mdash;but it also represents the possibility of species moving from one place to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I heard recently&mdash;and this alarmed me&mdash;is that some of these species in warm water may not immediately become apparent. In colder water, I understand, you soon find out when a species becomes established.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOGG" NAMEID="7L6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator Hogg</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's why your research base is important.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, exactly. But in warmer waters we have another problem, Senator Hogg, which is this: it is my understanding that a species can come in&mdash;especially algae and bacteria, and so on&mdash;and lie dormant in the mud in warm water for a period of years, until it mutates itself into a form which can thrive in that particular environment. That is really worrying because it means that we do not actually know what may be lying in the sediment of some of our ports in Queensland. That is why it is dreadfully urgent&mdash;as honourable senators on both sides who participated in the inquiry would be aware&mdash;that we do something about this. So, as I said, I am pleased to see that the government has put in place a mechanism to generate some $2 million in funds to research the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hogg has also raised the question of run-off, especially from acid sulfate soils. This is a real problem because, in Queensland, on the Gold Coast, for example, the acid sulfate run-off is caused by housing develop 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8520"> ments. On the Gold Coast hinterland, it is caused by exposing the soils, as they are being exposed, for housing developments. People see run-off as being a problem which arises out of farming or out of factories. But run-off problems occur from clearing land for houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that&mdash;not related to acid sulfate soils&mdash;you also have run-off problems because people do not understand that the water that goes down the kitchen sink does not go down the same drain as does the sewage from the toilet; they think it all gets treated at a sewage treatment plant. Often what goes down the kitchen sink or gets put out into the gutter goes down the stormwater drain and empties directly into a creek. People do not seem to understand that, when they put food scraps, for example, down a garbage disposal unit in their kitchen, they are contributing to nutrient levels in our creeks, our rivers and our coastal waters. Those nutrient levels are very dangerous&mdash;very dangerous to the fish that are out there; very dangerous to all life in those waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not that people want to destroy their environment; it is just that I do not think we do a good enough job of educating people as to how they have to protect our environment. Everybody has a role to play in this; everybody can actually do something about it. When I first discovered that what I put down the kitchen sink did not go to the sewage treatment plant but instead ended up in the stormwater drain, I ceased to put food down the kitchen sink. It does not take much extra effort. All it means is that when you finish cooking, or whatever, you put your waste into a bag and it goes in the garbage bin; you just do not wash it down the sink. That way, you do your bit to ensure that we do not increase nutrient levels in coastal waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would take time at this point to pay tribute to the Surfrider Foundation, which basically is a marine based environmental group that has done a lot of work on this issue. Surfrider is synonymous with issues to do with the surf; but it is also involved in issues to do with our coastal creeks and rivers. At Surfrider they understand that, if 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you do not clean up those creeks and rivers, refuse ultimately ends up in the ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on the Gold Coast, the Surfrider Foundation has been involved in a rehabilitation of Loders Creek, which has seen an area which was utterly devastated turned into something which is now supporting a community of native wildlife of birds and fish. Loders Creek had a large number of stormwater drains running into it; by rehabilitating it and educating the people in the area, they started to solve some of the problems. That, I believe, is one of the challenges: education is one of the challenges in protecting the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, ultimately, that there has been immense damage done to the marine environment of this country. But, because it is not easily demonstrated, because it is not trees being chopped down, because it is not topsoil being eroded away, people do not really understand the damage that has been done. We have real problems occasionally because there are pressures on coastal land, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales&mdash;pressures from development. The question is always: how do you maintain a sufficient number of mangroves to support the breeding of fish populations to support fishing industries? Isn't it interesting, Mr Acting Deputy President, that recreational and commercial fishermen these days are people who have an interest in supporting a reasonable number of mangrove areas so that we can maintain fish populations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hogg may well know, the area of Cleveland used to be a great area to go fishing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit in the very beginning that I have not had the opportunity yet to read all of this report. I have glanced through the executive summary and the executive summary of the minority committee report that is contained in the report itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, I wish to pay tribute to all members of the committee&mdash;and I do mean all members of the committee. I have had a look at the itinerary that the committee engaged itself in and at the number of witnesses it heard over a very short period of time. It was a committee investigation that should have gone over an extended period of time, perhaps allowing many more individuals to appear before the committee, but it certainly crammed a lot of work into a very short period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commending all members of the committee from all sides of the parliament, I also make reference to the support staff here in Canberra and those who accompanied the committee in its travels around Australia, particularly those who had the task of writing up the report. Obviously it is a great tribute to them that the report was actually tabled in this parliament this week. I think it was tabled on Monday in the other place and later in the week in this chamber. So everybody needs to be congratulated on a job well done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report itself is quite divided, as we all know, and I do not think that it was any surprise to anybody that the committee would hand down a majority report and at least a minority report, and maybe even more than one minority report. For that reason, I found Senator Abetz's remarks on Monday evening extraordinary when he criticised his govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's decision to make a concession to the opposition and Democrat members of the committee that they would have specific secretarial support throughout the course of the inquiry, and also in developing the minority report. I think there was a great expectation&mdash;a certainty rather than an expectation&mdash;that there would be a minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday evening, Senator Abetz sought to make capital out of that. If the good senator is criticising the decision, he is actually criticising the decision of his own government because it was his own government that made the decision; it was not something that we the opposition, the Democrats or any other political party did from this side of the chamber. So I do find it an extraordinary criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does happen from time to time in committees of this parliament, particularly in Senate committees, that the politics are able to be put to one side and a consensus opinion can be reached. Consensus can sometimes be reached even though opinions come from separate and quite diverse ranges: quite the opposite opinion can be put forward, but the recognition by the proponents of a softer line that they can learn from what the harder line is can be quite good, productive and constructive in the interests of the community as a whole. We will have to wait until debate on the bill concludes some time next month in this chamber to see whether or not that will be the case, and whether or not the government will indeed accept some of the many recommendations that are contained in the minority report of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I talk in detail about the minority report, I want to return to the comment that Senator Abetz made on Monday evening during the adjournment debate when he talked in his concluding remarks about the possibility of a deal being done during negotiations in 1993 on the Native Title Act. I will just quote a small part of what Senator Abetz had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do not think he would believe, nor would the National Farmers Federation these days, that they were in fact taken in and consulted to the extent that the Labor Party would now have us believe. The question then is, what about the mining industry?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then goes on about other things.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8522">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address the matter of the deal very briefly, drawing the attention of Senator Abetz&mdash;who is, incidentally, a member of the committee&mdash;to remarks made by the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Donald McGauchie, when he appeared before the committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact of the matter was that we had what we thought was an understanding. Clearly, in law, that understanding was not there. Now we can go over this and over this and over this. The fact of the matter is we were dudded by the fine  print, and we acknowledge that . . . I accept we were wrong. You can spend the rest of the day, Daryl, telling us we were wrong. Don't bother, because I will tell you that I understand we were wrong. We were done by the fine print, and that is that, but I will tell you we are not going to be that dumb again.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the words contained in the report attributed to Mr McGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation. Again, I found it extraordinary that Senator Abetz, a member of the committee, could so mislead himself on the matter of a deal in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the minority report, as contained in the report itself, is&mdash;and attempts to be&mdash;constructive to the Native Title Act. Very early, the minority report accepts that the Native Title Act 1993 is in need of amendment. It gives reasons and cites court cases to follow up on that point. Nevertheless, in its criticism of the Native Title (Amendment) Bill 1997, it goes on to say that this bill goes well beyond the requirements of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report suggests that the Native Title (Amendment) Bill 1997 rides roughshod over issues which are currently before the courts of this country and provides resolutions which uniformly favour the respondents in the case. The minority report argues that the bill denies procedural fairness to indigenous people who proceed to a court resolution of their claims. It suggests that the bill makes wholesale assertions about permanent extinguishment by a complex range of legislative and regulatory instruments where analysis of the full schedule of the bill turns up numerous instances where no such extinguishment can be sustained by reference to the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report suggests that the bill is incompatible with both the spirit and the letter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The minority report says that the bill makes a mockery of Australia's responsibilities as a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. I will be reading the report in total, including the minority report. I hope to be making a more detailed contribution to the debate on the Native Title (Amendment) Bill when it is debated in this place some time next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interim period, I hope that some of the heat which is currently in the debate is damped down a bit. That heat was, I might say, increased by some acts in the other place yesterday when certain members of a certain political party sought to amend the bill further. There are many in our community who are hoping for a fair and just resolution to the issue of native title in Australia. I believe the bill the parliament has in front of it does not and will not allow for a fair and just settlement, but I hope we can go some way toward achieving that during the debate on the bill next month.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief, but I think it is worth making a comment, seeing that I come from a background where, for election to office, I have been subject to the requirements of the act over a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As people know, I had the position of branch secretary within the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. As the Branch Secretary of the Queensland branch of that association, I and many other officials were subject to regular elections. I do not believe that many people are cognisant of the fact that people who occupy honorary and also full&hyphen;time positions within the trade union movement and federally registered or state registered organisations are subject to election by the rank and file of those organisations. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8523"> was subject to rank and file ballots over a lengthy period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that was always pleasing was the efficiency with which any election was conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission, but there was always one problem. That problem, alluded to in this report, is the problem of being in the position of supplying to the Australian Electoral Commission the correct addresses for members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I found in my lengthy period of time as a trade union official&mdash;and I am sure it is a problem for many people in many other facets of the community&mdash;is how mobile the Australian population is. I had the pleasure of being the secretary of a union of some 30,000&hyphen;35,000 members, and there were invariably between about 1,500 and 1,600 people for whom one never had the correct address. No matter what steps one took to try to secure the correct address from people, it was a very difficult task indeed. It is amazing to think how many times Australians must shift from one place to another without ever letting anyone know they have moved. It is really surprising. One becomes very aware of this when one is trying to conduct a ballot in conjunction with the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any step that can improve the conduct of the ballot is undoubtedly welcome. The practice in my organisation, even prior to recommendation 3 coming down in this report on industrial elections, was always to provide the Australian Electoral Commission with the only other alternative address that was ever available to us, and that was the place of work. That proved to be a way of communicating with these people, but more often than not one found that the people for whom you did not have a correct address had invariably left the industry. Whilst this seeks to redress the problem, in the end it may well be a problem that is fairly hard to fix, even at the best of times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I was pleased to see was that the conduct of the elections would still be done at no cost to the organisation itself. It should be clear to everyone that it is welcome that someone independent of the organisation has the conduct of the election. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That puts the officials of the organisation above and beyond reproach or criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, as a former full&hyphen;time official of the organisation, and even now still a part&hyphen;time honorary official, I think the system is important so that the rank and file members of these organisations are aware that the officers who are elected to the peak of their organisations are elected in a fair and proper manner, and that those eligible to vote have fair and adequate opportunity to participate in any ballot to see that they have the leadership that will give them a positive and forward&hyphen;thinking organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In November last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) told the parliament that everyone should look objectively at the process of assessing applications for the importation of chicken meat. I agree, but the process must also be open and complete. The assessment process must be transparent, with the industry an active party in that process. Most importantly, the process must be complete, and be seen to be complete, before any final decision is made on this important matter. The government owes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8524"> the industry and the public nothing less and yet the quarantine risk assessment has not been open and is far from complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key part of the AQIS process is a public health risk assessment undertaken by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. ANZFA commenced work on this assessment in 1994. My office was advised by the office of the parliamentary secretary responsible for ANZFA that assessment had been completed and was considered by the ANZFA council members last Tuesday. I have now been informed, by Minister Anderson's office, that the report is still in draft form and is not available. I can understand the minister's reluctance to release this report given his sorry history on this issue, but this report must be released and exposed to proper scrutiny. The industry and the public deserve no less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public health risk assessment is clearly a vital part of this whole process. It is an area of concern for both the chicken industry and Australian consumers. I do not have to remind the Senate of the numerous incidents, unfortunately some resulting in death, of food borne diseases in Australia. We cannot afford to take any chances in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has quite rightly progressed the development of hazard analysis and critical control points systems, known as HACCP systems, in the meat processing sector and elsewhere. There is currently a pilot scheme operating with a comprehensive evaluation process. The minister has discussed this process with his counterparts in both the USA and Japan. There is an international panel of experts overseeing the process. It is a sophisticated process involving a scientific, objective statistical analysis of both the old and the new systems. An AQIS vet is on site all the time, there have been monthly reviews by a senior AQIS vet and spot audits conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting a proper HACCP system in place is a lengthy and sophisticated process&mdash;and that is how it should be. We are entitled to expect a rigorous approach when it comes to food hygiene, not only in our own processing industries but also in those industries in countries seeking to export product to us. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> am happy to report that this is the position adopted by AQIS, the relevant Commonwealth authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANZFA recently informed the Senate estimates hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS advised ANZFA that imported chicken and pig meat products may only be sourced from AQIS certified establishments where a detailed, audited HACCP system is in operation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We fully endorse that position on this side of the chamber. It is important to note that the requirement is for a detailed, audited HACCP system. That standard can only be properly satisfied for imported chicken meat in an initial inspection of all processing plants proposing to send product here. A regime of regular spot audits by qualified AQIS officers is also required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to a question taken on notice from Senator Bob Collins, the government advised that an officer from AQIS visited Thailand in 1990 and inspected chicken processing plants in that country. Senator Bob Collins was advised that none of the plants visited had HACCP systems in place. He asked whether, on a second trip to Thailand by the same officer earlier this year, there were any HACCP systems in place in the chicken processing plants visited. The answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HACCP systems were not in place in any of the plants.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Based on the advice to the Senate from ANZFA and AQIS and the standards the government has set for the implementation and management of HACCP systems in Australia, it would appear that no product can be sourced from Thailand in the near future. A draft report from that second visit to Thailand has been with the minister for some time. It has not yet been provided to the parliament or the Australian industry but has been provided to the Thai authorities. An industry representative went on that trip and I understand she has sighted the document but has not been allowed to have a copy. The industry and this parliament are entitled to a copy of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar assessment process must be made of plants in the USA and Denmark. I would remind the Senate that a proper inspection of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8525"> all plants in all countries prior to any approval for chicken imports into Australia was recommended by the unanimous Senate committee report on this matter. No approval should be given until inspections of plants in the USA and Denmark have been undertaken and parliament and the industry are satisfied that plants in those countries can meet the high standards this government is imposing on our domestic meat processing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other important matter that I wish to raise tonight, and that is the relevance of the Australian food standards code to this matter. This is the code against which all food is assessed. My colleague Senator Forshaw asked a question about the provisions of the code in relation to cooked chicken and cooked pig meat. Senator Forshaw was told that there are currently no relevant microbiological specifications in the food standards code covering chilled cooked product. ANZFA advised that it planned to set specifications for chilled product as part of its public health risk assessment process. It stated that the specifications would be in addition to those for frozen product but would only apply to imported product, not domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a weakness in the food standards code then it must be fixed. It must be fixed properly and must apply to both domestic and imported product. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act lays out a proper and open process which the authority must follow if it is to vary the national food standards code. I am not aware that this process has been followed to correct this weakness in the code. But there must be an amendment to the code before any approval is given to allow imported chicken onto the Australian market. And proper process must be followed, that is, an open and complete process that provides for public input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that the Australian chicken industry is worth in the order of $2 billion a year. It employs, directly and indirectly, nearly 70,000 Australians, mainly in regional centres&mdash;areas where employment opportunities are limited. This industry is one of the success stories in Australia. It has grown steadily in terms of production, jobs and investment. It continues to improve its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitiveness both domestically and internationally, and it has looked to value add, and that means more jobs in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister still has a lot to do before he can properly consider applications to import cooked chicken meat into Australia. Firstly, the public health risk assessment undertaken by ANZFA must be released for proper consideration by all interested parties. Secondly, the government must satisfy itself, the industry and Australian consumers that proper hygiene standards&mdash;through a certified, detailed, audited HACCP system&mdash;are in place in all plants seeking to export product. Thirdly, until the Australian foods standard code is amended to ensure that appropriate microbiological specifications are in place for chilled cooked chicken meat, these applications should not be approved. Given the unanimous nature of the all&hyphen;party Senate committee report on this issue, I would expect the minister's backbench colleagues on the other side of the chamber to heartily endorse our position on this vital matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8525"><TITLE>Paralympic Games: Sue&hyphen;Ellen Lovett</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise during this adjournment debate to inform the Senate of a story of courage in the face of adversity; I think that is the best way I can describe it. It is a story of a remarkable young woman who is raising both awareness and money in support of the 2000 Paralympic Games. I am referring to Sue&hyphen;Ellen Lovett, a member of the Australian paralympic equestrian team, who is also actually on the board of the Sydney Paralympic Games. Sue&hyphen;Ellen's achievements and those of other remarkable athletes have ensured that the Sydney Paralympic Games in the year 2000 will receive the sort of recognition they deserve. According to a survey conducted by Woolcott Research, interest in attending the Sydney Paralympic Games has increased to over 25 per cent. Similarly, the likelihood of attending the Paralympic Games has risen to nine per cent. Supporting the underdog is a great Australian tradition, and I only hope that both awareness and interest will grow as Australians gain the Olympic spirit in the lead&hyphen;up to the games. Sue&hyphen;Ellen represented Australia in the 1996 Paralympic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8526"> Games in Atlanta in dressage. She has won many awards for her fundraising efforts and is currently the No. 1 ranked rider in Australia by the International Paralympic Equestrian Committee. In 1995 she won both the Australian stock horse national high points horse and the high points dressage horse of Australia. She competes regularly throughout Australia, most recently in dressage at the Royal Easter Show, and gave a dressage demonstration at the Trivett Classic. She is an Australia Day ambassador and has been the recipient of numerous honours, including an Australian Achiever award, the Bicentennial Medal, the Advance Australia award, a New South Wales Premier's award and the Equestrian Federation of Australia Award of Excellence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These achievements are beyond the reach of most of us in the community, but are even more remarkable when we consider the hardships that Sue&hyphen;Ellen has had to endure throughout her lifetime. At the age of 13, Sue&hyphen;Ellen was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, commonly known as tunnel vision, and she currently has only about three per cent residual vision. This is matched by the tragic circumstances of those closest to her: her mother also has the disease, as does her sister, who has only about 30 per cent of her sight left. And, if this was not enough, her brother had an unfortunate accident and is an amputee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than dwell on her misfortune, as well she might have, Sue&hyphen;Ellen uses it as a source of great strength. She also manages to see the amusing side&mdash;if there is one&mdash;of her plight. For instance, in a recent media story she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I was younger I used to ride cross&hyphen;country as well as compete in show  jumping and dressage. It was really funny when I was show jumping because everyone who came to watch the blind girl jump would hold their breath and pray.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sue&hyphen;Ellen's most recent venture was a 38&hyphen;day ride during September and October this year to raise funds and public awareness for the Paralympics. During this venture she was in the saddle, sometimes by 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning, riding for 12 or 13 hours a day. Often she would attend fundraising functions in the evening after an entire day in the saddle. Logistically, she has a sighted guide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> riding out in front of her, telling her in which direction to ride, and she has got a wonderful guide dog who follows in the back&hyphen;up truck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her ride from Melbourne to Sydney via Canberra covered a total distance of 1,455 kilometres and she did it at 85 kilometres a day&mdash;that is no mean feat. En route she visited 54 towns, hamlets and cities, attending more than 70 civic and community functions. Some of the New South Wales towns she passed through included my home town of Wagga Wagga, Adelong, Tumut, Gundagai, Yass, Moss Vale and Bowral. In fact, I was actually due to accompany her from The Rock to Wagga on a ride&mdash;we had planned to ride separate horses, I must hasten to add&mdash;but unfortunately the weather foiled our plans and I was not able to join her. I do hope to join her for part of the rides she undertakes in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sue&hyphen;Ellen literally has taken across the whole countryside her vision of the biggest Paralympics ever in the year 2000. In doing so, she has demonstrated the sort of personal courage and determination to triumph over adversity that is associated, I believe, with people on the land. This personal courage and determination is matched only by her depth of community spirit. For instance, during an earlier ride this year called Ride To Save Lives, she raised enough funds to install helipads at Mudgee, Gulgong and Rylstone hospitals. Her most recent ride through country New South Wales was part of an integrated communications and fundraising campaign for the Sydney 2000 Paralympics called Rides 2000. The program offers a unique opportunity to raise community awareness of, and interest in, the Paralympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all very excited about the Olympics in Sydney in the year 2000 but we cannot forget these wonderful people who compete in the Paralympics. It is an ideal opportunity to raise the profile and status of Paralympic athletes and sports men and women and to achieve substantial media awareness and coverage at a regional, national and international level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sue&hyphen;Ellen has done her ride from Melbourne to Sydney. She is going to go from Brisbane to Sydney. On another one she is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8527"> going to go from Adelaide to Sydney, and the Ride 2000 is from Moree to Sydney. I hope I can join her some time before the ride from Moree to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sue&hyphen;Ellen's achievements are both a personal victory and a victory for all Paralympic athletes. We are certainly hoping that her efforts will generate greater crowds and interest in the Paralympics. This sort of effort is matched by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Paralympic Games approving the inclusion of a number of new disciplines and events for the games. As recommended by the International Paralympic Executive Committee, the programs will now include programs for people with intellectual disabilities&mdash;outstanding athletes in their own right&mdash;in areas such as athletics and basketball. There will be amputee events in cycling; powerlifting will include weight categories for women; rugby is getting some additional teams; and in swimming and table tennis those with an intellectual disability are going to be included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These additions are a stark reminder of just how far the Paralympic Games have come since they were first held in Rome in 1960 with only 400 athletes competing at that time, representing 23 countries. Until 1972, Paralympic events were limited to athletes with spinal cord injuries. Today's modern technology and the continuing determination of these athletes have made the Paralympics an event with thousands of competitors including the blind, paraplegics, quadriplegics, people with cerebral palsy, amputees and others. The Paralympic Games in Atlanta boasted some 4,000 athletes, 1,000 coaches and team staff, 1,500 officials, technical personnel, the Paralympic Family and about 15,000 volunteers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this country has a very proud record. Australia's record in the Paralympics is truly phenomenal. Just listen to this: in Seoul in 1988 Australia scooped just 14 medals; eight years later in Atlanta our medal tally was 106, comprising 42 gold, 37 silver and 27 bronze medals. The sports in which the paralympians particularly excelled were swimming, athlet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ics, cycling, basketball, lawn bowls and tennis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not given a long catalogue of these achievements just for the sake of saying it. I am saying to the Senate and to all of those listening to this broadcast that Sue&hyphen;Ellen Lovett's achievements are truly an inspiration. Her vision to hold the best&hyphen;ever Paralympic Games in Sydney is something we can all take part in and can all achieve. Her strength of character and the strength of character of the other paralympians is something that will inspire all of us. Her recent comments about her love of horseriding suggest her dogged determination. I will finish with this quote, and I look forward to her future ventures:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I began to lose my sight people did say I should give up riding horses, but nobody should ever tell you what to do. You're the master of your own destiny.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Congratulations, Sue&hyphen;Ellen, and to all the other outstanding paralympians.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8527"><TITLE>Social Security</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to support our government's efforts to improve the accountability of the social security system and to reduce fraud. Nothing can be more unfair to the Australian community than to be financing a welfare safety net for people who are not genuinely entitled to it. I previously spoke on this issue in February of this year. At that time this government's commitment to improving the social security assistance system had already resulted in estimated savings of more than $10 million every single week. At that time the savings in South Australia were $1 million per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has now revealed that even more savings can be made from previously undetected welfare fraud. These new figures show that taxpayers will now save a staggering $28 million a week as a result of a more efficiently applied social security compliance program. In South Australia there will be savings of $2.3 million per week&mdash;up more than 100 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8528"> cent on the figures revealed just last February. Almost 270,000 reviews have been carried out across the state of South Australia by the Department of Social Security and this has resulted in the identification of more than 30,000 cases of overpayment in South Australia alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, more than $20 million worth of debts have been recovered from 28,000 individuals. These are people who have put their own welfare ahead of the wider community, which has been wrongly funding them. These updated figures are further evidence of the absolutely disgraceful inefficiency in the application of the welfare safety net by the previous government. It is worth recalling that the former Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, boasted in 1995 that Australia was leading the world in social security compliance. In October 1994, as minister, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that social security payments are properly targeted to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And three years later, in South Australia alone, we have found $2.3 million worth of savings every week. It is almost impossible to comprehend that there could be so many of our fellow South Australians abusing the privilege of the social security safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very clearly, Labor had a standard of targeting payments different from this government. As we can now see, they made money available to the greedy as well as the needy. What a disgrace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Conroy, I hope you are not defending these people. The previous government sat on its hands when it came to welfare fraud and the taxpayers of Australia paid the cost. This is another clear example of Labor's economic neglect. Our election commitment promised to take all possible steps to prevent fraud and to ensure that only those who are eligible under the Social Security Act could actually receive payment. In South Australia, 40 per cent of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the community receive social security payments&mdash;almost 578,000 individuals. They receive payments totalling $15&half; billion every year. This is the largest percentage of any Australian state population in receipt of these benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Newman's report tabled in this place yesterday revealed that more than three million compliance reviews have now been conducted&mdash;up by 27.6 per cent on 1995-96. There have been 333,000 payment cancellations or reductions identified. This is an increase of 40 per cent on 1995-96. This all adds up to ongoing savings of $28 million per week. Some targeting, Mr Baldwin. What a wonderful windfall for the thousands of honest taxpaying Australians&mdash;a saving of $28 million every week. And what a clear fulfilment of this government's election promise to take all possible steps to uncover fraud in the social security system.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.27 p.m." PAGE="8528"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.27 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am advised by the office of the Australian Government Solicitor that only two of the five matters in which the Commonwealth has filed an application for judicial review of HREOC decisions remain current. The following three matters have now been finalised:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secretary, Department of Defence v HREOC &amp; Messrs Burgess, Collins &amp; Lipping.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 18 July 1997, the Commonwealth's appeal was upheld by the Federal Court, and the decision of HREOC set aside. The matter was remitted to a differently constituted Commission, but the complaints have since been withdrawn and the matter finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Commonwealth of Australia v HREOC &amp; Aufgang.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The appeal to the Federal Court was resolved by consent. The parties agreed to set aside the HREOC decision and remit the matter to a differently constituted Commission for reconsideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following applications remain current:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Commonwealth of Australia v HREOC &amp; Roger Muller;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Commonwealth of Australia v HREOC &amp; Jeff Kellan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These application concern different determinations made under the Public Service Act 1922, but involve the same legal issues. In each case, HREOC found that the current respondents were discriminated against on the ground of sexual preference. The respondents had claimed allowances in respect of their same sex partners. One case involved an overseas living allowance, the other a remote area allowance. The Commonwealth submitted that the respondents were not entitled to the allowances under the relevant determinations, made under the Public Service Act, and the allowances had not been denied on the ground of sexual preference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The question of law are the same in both cases; first, whether HREOC adopted and applied a construction of the term `spouse' which was inconsistent with the definitions of the term in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relevant determinations; second, whether HREOC misconstrued provisions of the Public Service Act; third, whether HREOC erred in failing to hold that the determinations did not discriminate on the ground of sexual preference; and fourth, whether HREOC erred in finding that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 applied to indirect as well as direct discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Both applications for judicial review were filed in the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commonwealth is seeking judicial review in each case, because the Commission has made, in the view of the Commonwealth, errors of law and its decision has widespread implications for the administration of other Public Service determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commonwealth's submissions have not yet been prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) I have been advised that the Australian Government Solicitor and Counsel provided advice on whether the decisions contained errors of law and on the prospects of success if an application for judicial review were filed. The advice is subject to legal professional privilege. As with any litigant in the same position, the Commonwealth would claim that waiver of this privilege by release of the advice would risk prejudicing the advancement of its interest in the outstanding case, and therefore declines release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) no specific amount has been earmarked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) In each case, HREOC has only made a `submitting' appearance&mdash;that is, at the beginning of the case, the HREOC Commissioner concerned declared that he or she will abide by the Court's decision (whatever that will be), and take no active part in the case. Therefore, any costs incurred by HREOC should be minimal, and would be met by HREOC, for monies appropriated to fund its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) As mentioned in answer to Question 8, HREOC would pay any legal costs form monies appropriated to it to fund its operations. Also, as stated in my answer to Question 8, HREOC has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court in the current cases and, therefore, its costs should be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The grounds for judicial review in the present case concern the questions of law referred to in answer to Question 2. The policy grounds for instituting these appeals are referred to in answer to Question 4.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Ministerial Committee for the Sydney 2000 Games is currently examining important initiatives to improve the border processing of passengers through Australia's international airports in the lead up to and for the Games. The key initiatives are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the progressive expansion of Advance Passenger Information systems which capture data on passengers electronically and which will reduce processing times at international airports from an average 55 seconds to around 20 seconds; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reengineering the process by which key border management and other statistical data is collected so as to eliminate as much paper handling as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers established a group of officials to develop these initiatives. The group includes representatives of the border agencies and major users of passenger data, including the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Office of National Tourism, the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Australian Tourist Commission. Consultations were held with representatives of the airlines which provided written submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These initiatives are in addition to those announced by the Government on 16 May which include a $350 million extension of the international terminal and streaming Australian nationals through dedicated customs lanes to cut processing times by an expected 10% after dynamic signage is installed at Sydney Airport before the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. An inwards passenger must present, in addition to a passport, a passenger card and a Travellers Statement. Passengers are obliged to answer up to thirty questions relating to their entry on two separate forms. Some of the information on these forms, particularly the passenger card, duplicates that already held in visa computer systems. An outwards passenger must present a passport, a boarding pass and a passenger card which again duplicates some information already held on computer systems and requires a passenger to answer up to eighteen questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection and checking of these forms has a direct impact on the time taken to process passengers through airports depending on whether the forms are fully completed by the passenger, the legibility of their hand writing, their English language skills and their understanding of the questions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1, 2 and 3) Yes, a discussion paper on "Agreement Making within the Department" was distributed to all staff in July 1997, and a copy is attached. An in&hyphen;house information session on salary packaging was conducted on 7 August 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALL STAFF</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGREEMENT MAKING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department needs to consider our agreement making options under the Workplace Relations Act. I am interested in finding out your views on the way in which we should approach this task. The attached paper has been prepared so as to open all relevant issues for discussion and consideration. The thrust of the paper is about both the parameters of what we want to negotiate, and how we will go about the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not obliged by the Government to undertake any agreement making process. However, the bottom line is that agreements under the Workplace Relations Act are the only way in which we will be able to (firstly) maintain, and then advance conditions of employment within the Department. Therefore we must make a decision on this issue; bearing in mind the need to benefit people in the Department, and at the same time enable the organisation to move forward, and better serve the Government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations Act and the prospective new Public Service Act both provide us with significant flexibility to create an employment framework which supports our corporate goals. We are able to use this legislation to facilitate agreements which can meet the specific needs of our organisation. I am keen to take advantage of this flexibility to produce a set of employment conditions which is attractive to current and future employees and enables the Department to meet the challenges of the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My preference at this stage is for one Certified Agreement which will cover the entire Department. I am happy to talk with unions, and to maintain the strong relationship we have developed. However, I need to know your views before progressing any further; this needs to be a collective arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This paper outlines those parameters around which I would like to approach agreement making within the Department. None of the details are set in concrete; these will be developed in consultation, and I would appreciate you passing any preliminary comments you may have to the Workplace Relations Unit on Cox Level 2. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following are the proposed parameters against which the Department will approach the development of agreements under the Workplace Relations Act. They do not represent a firm negotiating stance, rather, an outline for a suggested starting point from which discussions can proceed. Each of the individual parameters is expanded upon in the attached paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The Department's preferred approach is for one departmental Certified Agreement, with provision made in that agreement for Australian Workplace Agreements for staff, eg, the SES, Senior Officers or specialist staff. The agreement will operate for at least 18 months from certification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. A senior management team will be set up to negotiate agreements on behalf of the Department, with support from a working group within People &amp; Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Considering the nature of our relationship with the various unions, the Department intends to use these established lines of communication in negotiating agreements. Additionally, individuals or groups may contact the management team to discuss the possibility of negotiating separately. All staff will be kept informed of progress with developing agreements so each employee can consider their interests and participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Within the context of a new Public Service Act and the Achieving Cost Effective Personnel Services (ACEPS) process, the Department will consider changes to a range of conditions of service to improve productivity and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.A Certified Agreement should contain a pay increase for staff during its life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. A salary sacrifice (exchange) arrangement will be considered should staff wish to exchange cash salary for non&hyphen;cash benefits based on a menu of items.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8538">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Department will support a move to new broadbanded classification arrangements, to be implemented during the life of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. No person will have their nominal salary package reduced as a result of moving into the new Certified Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. A performance management mechanism will be needed to manage progression through the broadbanded salary ranges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. The Department will maintain, and seek to enhance, its policy of effective people development, and its strong commitment to allowing people to balance their work, family and personal responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Agreements will be drafted in a way which allows us to include any changes arising from the new Public Service Act in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document spells out in detail each of the eleven items on the front of the paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Department's preferred approach is for one departmental Certified Agreement, with provision made in that agreement for Australian Workplace Agreements for staff, eg, the SES, Senior Officers or specialist staff. The agreement will operate for at least 18 months from certification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Workplace Relations Act, agreements made at the workplace will become more fundamental to Departmental operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of equity across the organisation, and administrative simplicity, the preference is for one departmental Certified Agreement (CA). We will work to link the CA to operate in conjunction with other major Departmental documents and programs which support our activities, future directions and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You should all be familiar with the terms of the Department of Transport Agency Agreement 1994&hyphen;95. A new Departmental CA would essentially operate in the same way as this. However, the earlier document was largely an addendum to the umbrella APS Enterprise agreement, and did not have a major impact on local conditions of service. Given the Government's emphasis on workplace level agreements, a CA will now contain many more fundamental conditions of service than previously. A new CA will, in conjunction with other supporting legislation, be the principal document to establish pay rates and conditions of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Timing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing of an agreement is also important. While agreements have a notional maximum period of operation of three years, it remains to be seen whether this is the optimum period for DoTRD's requirements. Given a significant number of organisational changes, it may be better to have the first agreement operate for a lesser period, eg,

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a new structure, however, will not isolate the Department from other public service agencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Subsection 7(1) of the Superannuation Act 1976 defines for the purposes of that Act what is meant by retirement on the ground of invalidity. It was described in the explanatory notes, that were provided at the time of introduction of the draft legislation to the Parliament in 1976, as providing that a reference to an eligible employee retiring on the grounds of invalidity should be read as a reference to his or her being retired on the ground of physical or mental incapacity to perform his or her duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The term "otherwise terminated" was intended to cover the involuntary termination of an eligible employee's employment (otherwise than on invalidity grounds) because of physical or mental incapacity to perform his or her duties.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All three cases focused on the issue of whether an annulment of the applicant's probationary employment under section 47 of the Public Service Act 1922 on the grounds of failing to meet the entry medical standard meant that the applicant had been `retired' or had had their services `otherwise terminated' on `the ground of physical or mental incapacity to perform their duties' for the purposes of subsection 7(1).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the reference to a `retirement' or `other termination' in subsection 7(1) indicated that `retirement' was a type of `termination' for subsection 7(1). Subsection 7(1) therefore only intended to deal with people who had their services terminated;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the modes of `termination' to which subsection 7(1) should be applied should be viewed broadly. The AAT noted that many members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme were not employed under the Public Service Act 1922 but had their terms and conditions of employment drawn from a variety of sources, including awards and contracts. Therefore subsection 7(1) should be given the `flexible and broad meaning `the legislature intended' it to have to cover these situations.
