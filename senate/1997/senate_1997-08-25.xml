<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I adjourned my remarks on 27 June I had already dealt with the provisions in this bill which relate to extending the capital gains tax rollover relief to retirement, prospectors' mining rights, a proposed fringe benefits tax incentive for remote area housing for primary producers, an increase in the age limit for superannuation contributions and R&amp;D tax concessions for partnerships. I had just started to speak on the proposed rebate for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a low income or non&hyphen;working spouse. It is on that matter that I wish to conclude my remarks this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure proposes a tax rebate of up to 18 per cent for the first $3,000 of contributions made on behalf of a non-working spouse or low income couples. Low income is defined as `having an income of less than $13,800, phasing out between $10,800 and $13,800'. The superannuation committee requested modelling from the government on how this measure would raise national savings. That has been the theme of the government's approach: `We must do this because it raises national savings'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This modelling has not been provided, and I do not think that we know or the government knows for certain that this measure will increase national savings. It will increase national savings only if the increase in retirement savings is more than the $38 million a year cost to revenue for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that depends on an assessment of who the people are who are most likely to benefit. We think they are likely to be taxpayers who, on top of the $3,000 a year contributions that the government will provide a tax rebate on in the savings rebate already announced in the budget, can afford to make even more savings contributions on behalf of a low income spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are they likely to be? I think they are much more likely to be high income earners than anybody else, because which ordinary Australian battling family with a dependent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5524"> spouse will be able to afford to make payments of $3,000 a year into their own superannuation? That is $58 a week. What families will be able to do that and then have money left over to contribute on behalf of their spouse?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every analysis of the savings patterns on high income earners shows that they will arrange their savings allocations to maximise after&hyphen;tax rates of return. Providing additional incentives will not cause them to save more. As we have been told so often&mdash;by Mr FitzGerald as well&mdash;what we are likely to see is a switch from one form of savings to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not want to discourage low and middle income families from increasing their contributions to superannuation if they can afford to do it. But we do not want to provide yet another tax break to high income families for their tax planning accountants to reduce their contribution of tax burden even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has foreshadowed amendments to the rebate to subject this rebate to the same means test as the family tax payments and the same assets test as is used in determining social security benefits. We think this is an entirely defensible position. If the government feels that these families are sufficiently wealthy to not need tax relief on tax, then why should we put in place inconsistent tax treatment here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not very long ago that the government wanted us to pass a superannuation surcharge tax for high income earners, arguing that their tax breaks were too high. With this bill, they get much of that tax break back again by simply transferring the contribution to their spouse's name. I think we should prevent that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the social security assets test is also consistent with the government's treatment of access to social security. If the government believes that people with assets above $376,000 should be self&hyphen;sufficient for social security payments, then why provide them with additional benefits of up to $540 a year from the taxpayer?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of lectures from the government on the need for means testing of social security benefits and other tax benefits. What we are saying in support of Labor's amendments is: `Let's just have some consistency.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another omnibus tax bill. The major issue most people will be focusing on will probably be the capital gains tax measures for small business, but there are other issues too. Capital gains tax&mdash;or CGT&mdash;is a tax on the increased value of assets. It is a tax on the increased value of investments or the increased value of a business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor do not pay CGT. Most people would generally pay CGT only on the sale of a house and maybe occasionally on some stock. Business people have to pay CGT on a few other investments or on some business assets. This includes assets in a small business or the small business itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capital gains are for assets that appreciate. They are not for cars, unless they are collector cars. They are not for commercial vehicles; they are not for business assets that depreciate, which are most business assets in either productive, resale or wholesale enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Manufacturing and office equipment depreciates. Most stock bought for sale depreciates. There is no capital gains on these. Capital gains taxes do not apply where money has been invested in depreciable assets. Standard business taxes take account of those, and they are usually deductions in the calculation of annual taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A small business typically invests in a shopfront or workshop and equipment, and in their stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade, or inputs. For both productive and resale businesses there is stock bought wholesale, or the costs of materials, plus labour, plus the cost of overheads which is balanced against business profits. Tax is paid on the profits each year as company tax. Capital inputs have capital balanced against assets. The increase in assets is due to capital input, so they are not capital gains. Most assets generally then begin to depreciate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5525">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a business is sold the sale price is either more or less than the audit value of the company. If it goes for more, then it is subject to capital gains. If it is sold for the same or less than the audited value, then there is no capital gain. There may be a capital loss. This is fairly typical of a small family business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where there is a gain in the businesses we normally think of as family businesses of ordinary people, that gain is generally based on a value put into the company as an identity&mdash;the goodwill or the name and profile of the company. The reputation of business has a value not reflected in monetary inputs but which may be reflected in the value of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another place where an increase in capital value may be generated is an incidental gain, such as when a business operates out of premises they own. If the business is sold, appreciation on the value of the land, irrespective of the business, may make it more valuable. Many small family businesses lease premises but some, especially older ones, may own the land they operate from. This is, however, a value which may require the business to be relocated or dissolved in order to be realised as something other than an appreciated asset. That is where capital gains are likely to affect the ordinary small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another class of small business, however. These are the family businesses of the well&hyphen;off whose prime purpose may be to provide more advantageous tax treatment of investment. As investment vehicles they generally do not own material stock bought wholesale for resale; they generally do not own materials or productive equipment. That is not the sort of business they do. They are vehicles for investing in assets that appreciate and so develop capital gains. These are the businesses most likely to be affected by the government's changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assets we are talking about are land, rental property, corporate stocks, bonds and other investment assets like paintings. Are these sorts of businesses the intended beneficiaries? What class of people are we seeking to benefit? In many regards this particular measure is equivalent to, and in line with, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Costello savings scheme which primarily benefits anyone wealthy enough to have reasonably large amounts of surplus capital&mdash;in other words, it would largely exclude the great majority of Australians, including small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trusts and such may operate businesses and, according to the Australian Taxation Office, for tax minimisation purposes people put assets like stock and paintings into such businesses. The tax office made that point and tried to convince me that the personal tax measures in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and in this other bill would not apply to such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be benefits for ordinary small businesses, but we seem to be talking primarily about giving CGT relief and roll&hyphen;over relief to what are effectively family businesses in the Dallhold model, shells for the rich in complex webs of business structures. We are told that the whole of business assets are considered in the assets test but we know&mdash;and we are often told by the tax office when it wants to claim more tax&mdash;that the rich get away with at least hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tax dodges by using the law to claim things that are not assets, or not theirs, or not assessable or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are told that under self&hyphen;assessment they will of course report the whole of their wealth. This measure is not likely to benefit small business. It will benefit structurally small companies involved in investment. Companies primarily holding investment assets of land, stock or whatever will be the big winners. This will mainly serve the better&hyphen;off sector of the community. Given the record of this government so far, this is not any surprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Greens, a fundamental issue is to assure that those who get the scheme are not the very rich. We would like to reduce the opportunity to rort the scheme as much as possible. In light of that, we will support the ALP amendments to replicate the ceiling of $5 million in assets and the measure to include personal use assets with resale value over $5,000 and those which increase in value. The latter are investments or can act as investments, even if they give us use value in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5526"> the meantime. We should not be creating tax shelter for investments in holiday chateaux or yachts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also seek limits to the amounts of capital gains that can be rolled over into retirement products. We do not think that the rich should be allowed to roll over massive amounts into retirement trusts, particularly where they have discretion on the investments as they do in some of these schemes. They can, of course, put money into such schemes without any real loss to current disposable income. This is not the case for working people. Workers are unlikely to be able to roll anything like half a million dollars into a retirement vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this measure will give an avenue to the rich to negate the effect of the so&hyphen;called superannuation surcharge tax which was supposed to do something about the way the well&hyphen;off could use tax breaks for superannuation to minimise tax. This provides them with another way of minimising tax by putting it into retirement funds. As a result, we will support the ALP amendments regarding the change from $500,000 to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another extremely contentious issue in terms of distributive justice is the superannuation contributions made on behalf of a spouse. This is what ordinarily the tax office would identify as income splitting and be doing all in its power to stop. Under this scheme a rich person should be able to get a rebate to put superannuation into their spouse's account when many people have trouble even supporting a spouse. It also runs entirely counter to the whole thrust of the superannuation surcharge tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not always agree with the Australian Taxation Office on the income splitting issue. In some cases, it serves valid social objectives to allow people, wealthy or not, to provide for others in a way that gives them some independence. It means that ultimately such beneficiaries will neither become dependants of those providing for them nor dependants of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue I look at in this regard is whether the person being provided for is already functionally of independent means. In such a case, it is not actual provision for their well 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being; it is simply rearrangement of family assets for tax minimisation. In most cases, where the spouse is a married spouse and the taxpayer is able to contribute $3,000 per year to their credit as a tax measure, one would conclude that they are likely to have either a substantial income or substantial assets. As a family, they will still have substantial assets and income relative to the vast majority of the population. In short, they will probably have incomes of upper&hyphen;level management workers, even if they are not flat&hyphen;out rich. Most people who get the superannuation contribution do not need it to maintain an adequate income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My assessment of this is that it is part of the general benefits this government is providing for the rich. It is an avenue for tax deduction that most people cannot use. It is an avenue that requires significant surplus capital for someone to make use of. It fits in nicely with the capital gains tax deals for the family investment&hyphen;oriented companies of the rich. It fits in well with the savings scheme, which benefits anyone making virtually any significant investment, but does almost nothing for investments of the size most people can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also part of the coalition agenda for women and families. It is a perk specifically designed to benefit families with one working partner. It does nothing for families where both people work. It does nothing for single parent families. My understanding of this is that it cannot be used to provide superannuation for a partner who no longer lives with the taxpayer, who is separated or divorced. I am surprised that, in the requirements for eligibility, the government did not include possession of a labrador and a white picket fence in the front yard. I suppose that is because the rich are more likely to have guarded security walls and an alsatian. What is the argument, that the spouse of someone who can afford to put $3,000 into the superannuation fund of their partner needs special incentives for their support? As a family they are likely to own at least one house and have substantial savings and investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At retirement age, the spouse and the taxpayer will probably be able to support themselves quite well. I have heard an argu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5527"> ment that not all women who are partners of the rich are well off, but if they were to leave their partner or if their partner was to die, they would receive substantial assets. A married spouse is likely to inherit. A married spouse, in the event of separation, generally gets alimony, half the joint assets and a part of the superannuation of their husband or wife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, I will oppose schedule 10 of this bill. There is no excuse for allowing income splitting by the well&hyphen;heeled to provide for those who will be provided for anyway in almost any case. There is nothing whatsoever to stop any well&hyphen;off person from putting money for a spouse into any investment they wish. There is no punitive taxation such as that applied to money invested in the name of a child. There is nothing to stop the well&hyphen;heeled from putting money for a spouse into superannuation, a house, stock, a trust or a savings account. We are not removing barriers; we are creating incentives through giving tax breaks of which the rich will primarily be able to avail themselves. This is a perk for the rich in so&hyphen;called traditional families and very few others will ever see any benefit from this. I oppose it strongly when basic social infrastructure and social services for all levels of society are being cut off due to lack of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do recognise that this measure is likely to pass with the support of the Labor Party. I understand the ALP will put amendments to make the tax break conditional on the taxpayer's income and assets and to exclude the richest. We will support that. I believe, if this goes ahead, to the greatest extent possible it should at least be limited to those who actually need it,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that light, the definition of `spouse' in the Income Tax Assessment Act is fairly broad and includes virtually anyone living together in a marriage&hyphen;like relationship. It explicitly includes people who are not legally married. While I have argued that those married to the rich are liable to be provided for whether or not they explicitly have a superannuation account, there may be an argument in relation to those who are not married. It is more difficult for a non&hyphen;working or minimally&hyphen;working de facto partner to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claim assets or support in the case of death or separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since those who are married will probably be looked after, I will put an amendment to make it a requirement that, to get a tax break on such a contribution, the spouse should be unmarried&mdash;or de facto in the case of people in a more problematic situation. There is another class of spouses who are in an even more problematic situation, where they are even less likely to be awarded alimony or part of family assets in the event of separation, whether or not they have children. This group of people is currently also excluded from marriage. I am talking about same&hyphen;sex spouses. In line with our general recognition of familial diversity, I will also seek to broaden the definition of `spouse' in the Income Tax Assessment Act to include de facto same&hyphen;sex couples on the same basis as de facto opposite&hyphen;sex couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some major problems with the research and development section of this bill, which is designed to assure that syndicate&hyphen;like partnerships are not allowed. In previous bills, I supported research syndicates as good mechanisms to provide corporate funding for research and said at that time, if there were problems with claims for false or invalid research projects, that should be addressed directly, rather than gutting the scheme. In fact, it was the Senate amendments which preserved some measure of these schemes against the attack of government. So arguments about assuring that the intention of the Senate is carried out hold little weight. I still believe R&amp;D is important and partnerships, including those that are syndicate&hyphen;like, should be allowed with whatever is needed to make sure the research projects themselves have value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe there are questionable aspects in allowing the beneficiary or trustee who acquires a dwelling as a result of death to be deemed to have acquired the dwelling at its market value on the date of death. I think the capital gain should be over a greater period, either from the date of acquisition or from the value in 1985 when capital gains tax became payable on houses. I am not in favour of supporting high levels of inherited wealth. If 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5528"> a person owes a fair bit of tax on getting a house, I cannot imagine that, with a house as collateral, they cannot get a long&hyphen;term loan. Capital gains tax is a minimal form of wealth tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will ask questions in the committee stage about the sales tax on telecommunications and audio&hyphen;visual equipment. I have a problem with the way the tax office will consider the components in something like a solar water heater, exclude the specially designed tanks that are there on the basis that they can be used for other purposes and then try to push the reverse principles for items like transformers that plug into equipment, even though those transformers are able to be purchased separately as exempt electrical goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to note that although I will support the measures to ensure that superannuation contributions are made in respect of workers over 65, I fear in terms of this and other measures of government that this tends to be the first stage of a push to extend the retirement age to 70. I do oppose this. I think it is one of those things where something dressed up as a reasonable measure is actually part of a wider covert agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other minor issues in this bill, but I remind senators that we are putting all these issues into law. After assent, they will affect real people and will change the structure of our society in small or large ways. It is not enough to claim that we are in a hurry, that we do not have time to properly consider the issues in this bill. `We were in a hurry,' does not really cut it, especially at the beginning of a session. We owe it to the people of Australia to properly debate and amend legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R208">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R194">Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . We have debated them before. We are continuing our debate. My colleague, Senator Sherry, has argued persuasively and cogently about the inefficiencies in <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R208">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</XREF>  and  <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R194">Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  and foreshadowed, on behalf of the opposition, changes that are appropriate to make these bills just and fair for taxation payers in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. I support his remarks and hope that the Senate can be persuaded to the course of rationality that he has presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to concentrate my remarks, however, on one aspect of these omnibus bills, that is, section (pa) of the tax act&mdash;that section of the tax act that deals with the rights of prospectors in a range of industries, but including the goldmining industry, when they sell prospects that they have discovered for mining for future development, that is, mining by a mining company of some sort or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the government announced that it was going to close down what it called a loophole for what it alleged was tax avoidance by who it said was prospectors for minerals in Australia. When the opposition looked at the proposal that the government had actually brought forward as opposed to what it claimed it was going to do, the opposition said it would support the principle of the change because it did, in fact, render a service to the tax act and provide tax fairness across the board, but that what it would not support was retrospective application of that proposal. This debate is really about that issue: whether or not the government is proceeding to retrospectively claw back from taxpayers rights that they are reasonably, justifiably and fairly entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that a Senate committee, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, examined this and came down with a recommendation&mdash;I recall unanimously&mdash;that retrospectivity here on tax law should be avoided. It proposed certain things, none of which the government has followed. The government, in bringing forward the changes that it has brought forward today, knows that it is directly opposing a finding of the Senate economics committee with respect to this provision. I say these things to make the record clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is probably one other explanation that is necessary to make the record clear. Last year, before the parliament rose, this provision came before the parliament as part of a series of provisions. At that time, I moved an amendment on behalf of the opposition which would have clarified the situation and put it beyond reasonable doubt. That amendment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5529"> was not carried by the Senate. An amendment which constricted and, I believe, in the minds of the people who moved it and in the minds of the senators who voted for it, would have prevented retrospectivity, but prevented it in a more intelligent way, perhaps they would argue, than mine did&mdash;I think mine was very intelligent, but they would argue that theirs was better, and I respect their difference&mdash;would have restricted it and nonetheless prevented retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are now&mdash;I think I state this fairly and without challenge&mdash;that, firstly, the change made last year is a change that is very difficult for the tax office to implement. Secondly, it is a change which does not protect the industry from retrospectivity. It is at this point that the further amendment that the government proposes comes forward. That further amendment, and the one that we now have in front of us for debate, does these things. It certainly makes the provision workable by the tax office, and that is, I guess, half a blessing, but what it does not do is address the issue of retrospectivity. In fact, it maintains a situation in which there would be retrospective application of the tax law unfairly and unjustly to this sector by the government if the amendment before the chamber is carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my intention, and I now hereby formally foreshadow it, to move in the committee stage an amendment which is, in the first instance, the amendment that I moved last year and which was defeated&mdash;a broad amendment to prevent retrospectivity. In the event of that amendment being defeated, I will move a more targeted amendment which I think collects the points that were made by those of the senators who supported the current amendment last year and delivers on their intent. There will be a third amendment in the case of the second one not succeeding. I formally give notice that, in the committee stage, I will move those amendments, clean up this issue once and for all and provide tax justice and fairness for an important sector of the Australian community. In terms of strategic importance, this is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of the Australian mining sector as a whole.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is true&mdash;and I will not elaborate this point at great length, although it ought to be emphasised and well understood in this chamber&mdash;is that Australia's major industry, particularly its major export industry, is mining. The existence and continued wellbeing of that industry sector depends on a healthy level of prospecting going on in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not prospect, we do not find future mining sites, and therefore we do not realise our ability as a nation to harness our mineral wealth for the national good. If we stop prospecting or we put hurdles in front of it to make it more difficult, or if we push people out of the prospecting sector, in the longer term we will choke off the ability of the mining sector as a whole to perform for the Australian economy the important role it has historically had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fundamental contention of mine that the government amendments would impose considerable constraint on the prospecting sector. Certainly, they would drive the small prospectors out of the sector, and they are the ones who have a better record, I would argue, of finding mineral associations worth mining. Prospecting would be left to the corporate giants who follow the conservative plays and who have a less impressive record, in my view, than the wildcatters&mdash;the small prospectors, who are the ones prepared to take the risks and make the chances of finding something more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now go to the government's proposal. As I said, we supported the closing off of this so&hyphen;called loophole, but we did not support it being done retrospectively. The amendment that we moved would have succeeded in achieving that. It was defeated. It was believed that the amendment that was carried closed off the loophole but did not provide retrospectivity. It is now found that it does not do so and that the clause is unworkable. Thus, the government is amending it again. The problem with the government amendment is that it makes the act workable but it does not answer the issue of retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to three issues directly. The first, and the easiest to scotch, is the question of attacks upon me and self&hyphen;interest. I am a

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, indeed, colleagues! Some people say that this is a Western Australian issue, that the national good is being put aside in the interests of one state and that I, as a Western Australian, do not care about the national interest. To those attacks I say that the national interest is best served in these circumstances by not imposing retrospectivity in taxation law on the whole of this industry, wherever it is practised in Australia. The fact that there are probably more gold prospectors per head in Western Australia than in any other state is not the point, because gold is not the only metal or mineral that is subject to these provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, my colleague in the other place, Mr Stephen Smith, the shadow minister for resources, when attacked by a Tasmanian House of Representatives member, Mr Chris Miles, made the point that there is a vibrant minerals industry in Tasmania and that many of the other mineral commodities affected by this provision, other than gold, are found in that state. The list of those other minerals reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Antimony, chromite, cobalt, copper, gold, ilmenite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, monazite, nickel, osmiridium, pyrite, rutile, tin, tungsten, zircon and graphite.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prospecting for any one of those minerals is covered by the provision that is now before us, and it is in the national interest to protect the rights of prospectors wherever they are in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the time to have a debate about gold, but I intend at some point to raise the issue of the decision of the Reserve Bank to sell Australia's bullion reserves, at the value of $2.4 billion, while at the same time wiping something like $2 billion off the value of shareholders' gold&mdash;in other words, having it transferred directly from the pockets of Australian shareholders to the Commonwealth Treasury. That has quite dramatically affected the price of gold and the value of one of Australia's leading export metals and has made marginal a number of functioning mines 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this nation. That is an aside to the issue we are debating, but it is a debate I intend to have when the opportunity better presents itself later in the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to this amendment, two specific issues are worth going to. Referring to the prospector, last year's amendment specified&mdash;and I refer to clause 23(pa)(ic)&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the person, on or prior to 20 August 1996 and at the time the income was derived . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This clause is saying that the remuneration from the sale of a mineral lease is taxable not at the time at which it is sold but at the time at which the income is derived from the sale. That is an important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that it is requiring the taxpayer to be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. The government contends, firstly, that this provision reflects the policy behind section 23(pa) since its introduction. Secondly, the government contends that it is a fundamental requirement that the exemption is only available to the person who has undertaken the majority of the fieldwork in that area. Thirdly, the government contends that it ensures that the tax treatment of income derived in an income year applies to the circumstances in that year. Finally, the government contends that to remove this requirement would amount to a change of policy during the phasing&hyphen;out period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the explanations I have been given. Let me deal with each of those contentions. Firstly, the policy behind section 23(pa): the first point to be made is this is an attack on the small prospector who returns income on a cash basis to comply with tax law; that is, when the cash is received is when they are required to disclose the income. Larger prospectors who are required to account for income on an accruals basis can disclose the income when they sell the prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any delay in settling the sale of tenements due to, for example, native title claims or ministerial approval for transfer of tenements, then the bona fide prospector is at risk of losing their exempt status. These delays which are outside the control of the prospector could take months or years to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5531"> resolve. Loss of exempt status could arise where the purchaser moves onto the area and carries out extensive work such that the fieldwork of the prospector is subsequently swamped by the purchaser's fieldwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence that the exemption was previously only allowed where the taxpayer could prove that they were a bona fide prospector at the time the income was derived. As an example, I cite the Biggs case. The Biggs case involved a number of transactions with delayed settlements. The court made no inquiry in that case as to the work carried out by the purchaser after the prospector had sold the tenements and neither was this raised by the commissioner at that time. Whilst that was dealing with the old section 23(p), there is no material difference in its wording on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATO in its tax ruling on bona fide prospectors makes it clear that the status of the bona fide prospector is determined at the time of disposal, not when the proceeds are received. The following sections of TR 92/19 issued by the Australian Taxation Office in 1992 prove that the government is wrong in its assertion that this represents a change of policy, because the policy has always been to determine eligibility for the section 23(pa) exemption at the time the rights to mine are disposed of, not at the time that the income is derived. The two relevant sections of the tax ruling are sections 7 and 48. I will not read them in full now in the face of time but I reference them for the officers advising the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second proposition in the government's argument is that the exemption is only available to the person who carries out the majority of the fieldwork. I guess that has to be accepted because that is what section 23(pa) says. But the issue is at what point does that test have to be satisfied:  at the time income is derived or at the time of disposal of the rights to mine? The second proposition I think adds nothing to the government's argument and does not detract from the argument that I have put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The third contention of the government that I have cited is a meaningless statement and does not provide any support for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argument. There is no fundamental provision in tax law that states the income tax treatment of a transaction must always be determined by the circumstances which apply in the year income is derived. As an example of that, take the sale of the family home: whether it is exempt from capital gains tax is dependent on a number of issues, many of which have nothing to do with the circumstances in the year the home is sold. Its use for income producing purposes 10 years ago will affect the tax liability on sale. It also raises the question of what circumstances are being referred to by the government in this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The final of the four reasons I gave, and which the government holds to, also falls away as the analysis in my first point shows that it has always been policy to consider the fieldwork test at the time of disposal, not at the time of income derivation. So there is no change in policy. I think the point about becoming eligible at the time the return is received by the individual should be registered. As I understand it, that is also a position supported strongly by the Minerals Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other point in this amendment concerns market value and how you arrive at a market value. I will make two quick points in the time that I have left. In June 1995, the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy issued a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Code and guidelines for assessment and valuation of mineral assets and mineral securities for independent expert reports</EMPHASIS>, which is called the Valmin code. The Valmin code makes it clear that, in making market value assessments, you ought not give one figure. There is a range of figures because you are looking at a number of factors that could change. I cite the Valmin code as the industry code for guidance in setting market value valuations. This amendment, if carried, would require there to be a one&hyphen;figure valuation; whereas the industry code, which is supported by the Australian Stock Exchange as the reasonable code and endorsed by the Minerals Council of Australia as the appropriate code, makes it clear that you cannot report the values in that manner.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5532">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> To continue that point, the Australian Securities Commission, in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Practice note 43 on valuation reports and profit forecasts</EMPHASIS> released in December 1993, specifically makes that point in paragraph 38 as well. So when you are calling for a valuation in the tax act, you ought to know that the valuation codes of the regulatory authorities&mdash;the Securities Commission, the Australian Stock Exchange and the Minerals Council&mdash;do not require and argue specifically against the possibility of coming up with a single figure valuation. Therefore, the provision in this bill would fly against the basic means of regulating forecasts or assessments of valuation of properties held in that time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Since the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 is an omnibus bill and there are detailed arguments in relation to a number of contentious clauses of it, I thought that I would handle the detail in the committee stage rather than debate the detail as it has been raised by honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I do thank the senators who have made a contribution to this debate. I would like to make a number of broad statements to conclude this second reading debate, and to commend the second reading to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, Senator Cook has just spent a long time giving a detailed analysis of the proposals and the effects of clause 23(pa). What the government is seeking to do is to put into effect&mdash;and Senator Cook appreciates this to the extent that he says it makes it more administrable by the tax office and that that is half like a good idea&mdash;the amendment that was moved successfully by Senator Murray in the committee stage consideration of a previous tax laws amendment bill in relation to making sure that the effect of this provision was entirely prospective&mdash;please excuse the pun on the word `prospector'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely nothing&mdash;and these amendments will ensure that that is the case&mdash;which makes the proposal retrospective. In fact, the effect of one of the Labor amendments would be to ensure that the proposals 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and, specifically, the effect of the grandfathering proposal are lost because it fails to restrict it to a bona fide prospector. But I will get into the details on that debate when we move to the committee stage shortly. It is also worth pointing out, even though I will go into more detail in the committee stage, that the effect of the Labor amendments on the revenue, combined with the effects of the previous amendment, would be in the order of $100 million. But that may not be of concern to those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other matter which will be of importance to many tens of thousands of small business people across Australia, the amendment to be moved by Labor and the Greens&mdash;and there have been indications of support from the Democrats&mdash;seeks to reduce the capital gains tax exemption relief provided to small business people from $500,000 to $250,000. We hear from the Labor Party and the Democrats, but not so much the Greens, that they are in favour of helping small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the coalition done to help small businesses? We hear that very often in this place. We see it in the newspapers and hear it on television, and we hear it from small business people. The coalition is delivering a fundamental commitment to provide capital gains tax relief for small business people. But when we bring it before the Australian Senate they say, `Sorry, the small businessmen are all these wealthy people. They don't need this sort of relief&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHERRY" NAMEID="ZW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I didn't say that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not you, Senator Sherry, just generally. That mob out there say that that is too generous. I think it is fair to say to the small business people of Australia that next time they see a Democrat or Labor senator they should ask them, `Why did you chop down my capital gains tax exemption from $500,000 to $250,000?' The Labor Party brought in&mdash;just to make the argument&mdash;the reasonable benefits limit under its superannuation policy which, at the moment, subject to indexation, is up to around $909,000. So if you are a superannuant, you get relief up to $909,000. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5533">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will put it into context. What we are putting in place is relief for a small business person who has built up a small business&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Conroy is saying `make it optional'. Senator Conroy wants to destroy small business; he wants to tax them to death; he does not want to give them relief. He does not want to give them support and assistance. He does not want to give them tax reform. I wonder if he supports Senator Gareth Evans's proposals for inheritance taxes. You had better tell us where you stand on that, Senator Conroy. Maybe he will bring in inheritance taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he will tell the states to do it. That is a good question to ask of the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. Does he support Gareth Evans's proposal for inheritance taxes? Does Mr Brumby want to bring in inheritance taxes, or are you going to bring Joan Kirner back and ask her to bring in inheritance taxes? This is what Senator Conroy and the others opposite will bring in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you are a small business person and you put your life savings at risk and you invest in a small business and you seek to employ people, we are saying that we will give you capital gains tax relief of up to $500,000 if you have a business that is worth less than $5 million. Then Labor says, `No, that is too generous.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you put it in context, we are saying, `Right, at the end of a lifetime's commitment to this small business'&mdash;and it is over the entire lifetime&mdash;`you are exempt from the capital gains tax provisions up to a maximum of $500,000.' If that small business person has been successful enough to put away a capital gain of $500,000, they can go and invest that in a bank or in some other managed investment and expect a return. I do not know what the banks are paying at the moment, because I do not have any savings in a bank at the moment, but you could expect a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return of something like $25,000 if you invested $500,000 at five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Greens and the Democrats and the Labor Party are saying is that a small business person cannot receive that sort of retirement income. What we are saying is that this is a matter of choice for small business people. The people opposite say, `Oh, we have to encourage the small business sector, get them out there investing and creating jobs,' and we agree with that. What we are saying is, `Let's give them some incentive.' A lot of small business people do not have the money to put into superannuation or other savings. They pump their money into their small businesses. They put the money into the small business to try to create an income for themselves and their families&mdash;obviously to look after themselves in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that it is very good to invest in your own small business. We are saying that, if you do that&mdash;if you make that commitment and you invest and you employ people, especially young people&mdash;there should be an incentive at the end of it. We are saying that, if you can put together $500,000 under all of the constraints within this legislation, under current interest rate regimes and returns on investments, you might get $25,000 or $26,000 or $27,000 in retirement income because of this measure of tax relief for small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, the Labor Party and the Greens have said, `No, that is too generous. You can't have $500,000. You can't have $25,000 a year. We are going to chop that in half to $250,000.' So for a lifetime's work and a lifetime's commitment to small business, to helping Australia, to employing people and to providing for yourself, you can have $12,500 income to live off for the rest of your life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you very much, Labor Party, and thank you very much, the Australian Democrats. We think the small business people of Australia deserve this relief. We think it is a way to encourage small businesses to invest in Australia and to go out and employ people. You are saying, `Don't have any of that. Make sure they go on the pension when they retire.' That is the message for small business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5534"> people. We will watch how you vote on this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that amendment, the other proposals for change to throw 23(pa) open and the other matters, the government regards these as important measures. They are measures that implement our commitments to the Australian people, particularly to the small business sector, in relation to FBT, to remote area housing and to the other matters in this bill. If those amendments are carried&mdash;and we refer specifically to the CGT exemption and to the changes in relation to 23(pa)&mdash;then the government will have to present the bill back to the Senate to insist on the important measures that are within it.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments flow on from the points that Senator Campbell was making incorrectly about Labor's approach to the capital gains tax rollover amount that will be exempt from tax under this proposed legislation. We propose to reduce the capital gains tax rollover amount that will be exempted from tax if rolled over into a retirement product from half a million dollars to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard our approach as an equity measure. Currently, a worker who receives a bona fide redundancy payment receives a tax-free amount of $4,348 plus $2,174 for each year of service. For a worker to qualify for up to $250,000 of tax relief under a bona fide redundancy, they would have to work for 113 years, according to the figures I have got, and that is clearly an impossibility for any Australian worker to do. So even Labor's proposed amendments making the rollover of the retirement product $250,000 at the exemption level rather than half a million dollars, as the government is proposing, are still extremely generous when seen in the context of what is available to other people in the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a number of other aspects to Labor's approach to this that should be taken into account. For example, many small business operators do currently have operating superannuation schemes as well as their small business. Senator Campbell might like to provide us with the figures of the number of small business operators who have superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those small business people who are going to benefit from this measure and also have superannuation schemes enjoy a very generous&mdash;we believe, correctly generous&mdash;approach for the tax treatment of superannuation. So they have got that benefit as well. We do not believe it is appropriate that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxpayer should subsidise the retirement of a number of people by giving tax relief up to $500,000 in capital gains given these circumstances. We think $250,000 is reasonable enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell should also address Labor's amendments in the context of some of the other changes his own government has made. For example, we had a very lengthy debate in the context of the deeming of superannuation at age 55. It is a measure which your government has introduced. Labor has taken a consistent approach on these types of benefits to people in the broader community. The consistent approach is: we have taken the view that a quarter of a million dollars is a reasonable level at which to strike these exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of deeming superannuation, in respect of which, I have to say, your government has passed legislation, you have deemed people's superannuation assets when they turn 55 starting, effectively, at $30,000. The people who are affected by this measure are people who, in many cases, have struggled long and hard to put money aside into superannuation in exactly the same way that the small business entrepreneurs in this country have struggled over many years to build up a business. There is no difference of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect to these amendments is that there is a change of the test from a net business asset test to a net total asset test by including all personal use assets, except for those personal use assets that have a value of less than $5,000, which will be excluded. We do not accept your exemption figure of half a million dollars, but let us assume that is passed. Is it reasonable for a small business operator to be able to benefit not just with respect to their business assets but also with respect to the personal wealth assets that they have got? We do not believe that that is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that there are some small business operators who have art collections or boats or other assets that they have accumulated. I do not criticise them for that accumulation of those personal assets. What small business operators choose to do with their money is up to them. But to not exclude those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5536"> types of assets when establishing the effective cut&hyphen;off point for the exemption from capital gains tax is totally wrong in principle and totally wrong in terms of fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times we have heard a lot about fairness and equity in relation to the government's approach on superannuation. I ask Senator Campbell: where does the issue of the new tax on superannuation fit into small business? I know a lot of small business operators who are very angered by the introduction of the new 15 per cent superannuation tax, for example. It seems to Labor, Senator Campbell, that on a range of superannuation issues&mdash;treatment of capital gains tax, the new tax on superannuation, the deeming provisions&mdash;your policy approaches are totally inconsistent. You introduce a new tax in one area, you deem superannuation in another area, then you attempt to give a substantial benefit. Labor believes that there should be a benefit given to small business. But you have taken a totally contradictory approach in a range of your policy initiatives and legislation to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that small business operators should be rewarded. Taking into account their background, their dedication and commitment over many years, and taking into account the other issues that I have outlined, this figure of $250,000 is a reasonable figure to allow to be rolled over from the assets of a small business into a retirement product and to exempt from capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach in these amendments is not philosophically to disagree with your approach, Senator Campbell, that small business should be rewarded. We endorse that approach. But we are here arguing about the justice, the fairness and the equity across the general community. Even if Labor's amendment is carried, and this figure is reduced to $250,000, in comparison with the rest of the community small business is being generously treated. We do not decry their being generously treated, but we think that some level of relative fairness and equity across the general community has to be taken into consideration, as matched against ordinary workers, as matched against everyone else in the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you were to listen to Senator Campbell, you would think that the parliament had done nothing at all for small business since this government came into office, and that is not true. I think we need to get the issue of the capital gains tax rollover into perspective. We are not saying, Labor is not saying, that we do not want to see the retirement savings of small businesses fairly treated. We are differing over what we think is fair and equitable. We are saying that we want to make sure that large businesses cannot use this to wangle a benefit meant for small businesses, and I think the threshold the government is setting makes that possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should put on the record the tax breaks we have already provided for small businesses. The parliament agreed quite enthusiastically, as I recall it, to a rollover of the proceeds of the sale of a business each time it is used to buy a new business. So that gives those small businesses a deferral benefit. That is a real benefit, because that is a tax that they do not have to pay until many, many years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot about small business people having the opportunity to save through their businesses. Senator Sherry has pointed out how long it would take people to save the equivalent of this tax break. At another level, the fact is that a normal PAYE taxpayer has to save out of their after tax profits, but a business which saves through the business can frequently save money without having paid any tax on it. That is especially true if the business is incorporated and the earnings are retained within the company. Some people might say that that is, in some respects, a form of tax avoidance, but it is a tax advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have to ask: what is the advantage of rolling over from the business to super anyway? When would a person want to do that? They would probably want to roll over close to retirement age. That is a lot different from asking people to put money away much earlier in their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that if this measure is not properly targeted it will not end up encouraging retire 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5537"> ment savings and will provide a new tax planning opportunity pre&hyphen;retirement for a lot of people for whom it was not intended to. We have all said time and time again that we approve of doing something for genuine small business people&mdash;people who might not otherwise have sufficient funds to retire on&mdash;to help them save for retirement, but we do not think that extending the measure to bigger business, the owners of which would already have sufficient retirement savings anyway, is a good idea. We think that is throwing money away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we think the $250,000 cap is very reasonable. It will catch, in an advantageous way, those business people who might have ended up on a part pension. We cannot see any merit at all in providing a new tax concession for people who would already be sufficiently wealthy not to end up on the part pension. The effect of this Labor amendment is simply to say: this is a reasonable cap, it gives genuine small businesses on average incomes a good incentive and does not allow slightly bigger ones to wangle a tax advantage.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator Harradine, we, in a sense, debated this approach with respect to the exemption during the last sitting of the Senate. I would ask you to take into account your position on that occasion with respect to your consideration of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Harradine interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you have it all there, Senator Harradine. I would also ask you, Senator Harradine, to consider the fact that, if no-one is disagreeing in principle with the government's approach, it is still important that we consider, as we have done on previous occasions, issues of fairness and equity in our approach to what is the relevant cut&hyphen;off point for the rollover to take effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said in my previous comments, the superannuation tax concessions that are already available should be taken into account in the context of small business. Many small business people do have money in superannuation more broadly and obtain a significant tax benefit that way, albeit some of them are very upset at the government's new superannuation tax. Isn't it reasonable, Senator Harradine, to take into account other personal use assets such as those I touched on&mdash;art collections, boats or other forms of personal use assets worth more than $5,000&mdash;if that is where some small business people have chosen to acquire assets and wealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell referred to small businesses building up assets over many decades in some cases. I would like to point out, Senator Campbell, that capital gains tax only applies to assets built up since 1985, not to assets prior to 1985. We are not dealing with, as you wrongly and very generally and emotively asserted, assets built up over decades. That is just not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my point in respect of small business more generally. I, like many of my colleagues such as Stephen Martin, our small 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business spokesperson, and a number of our other shadow ministers, spent a lot of time with small business. I would have to say that, in the last couple of months during the recess, there are two issues that small business raised consistently with Labor. I suspect they have raised them consistently with you too if you are honest about what small business has been saying to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue they raised with us is that they want consumer confidence restored. They want customers coming through their business door and spending money. There is a significant lack of confidence within the broader community and small business is suffering as a consequence of that lack of confidence which, to a significant part, I would argue, Senator Campbell, your government has created. There is a significant lack of confidence within the community. I am not just basing my remarks on small business in Tasmania. If you want a small business desert at the moment, come to Tasmania. They are very concerned about trading conditions. That concern is more generally held by small business right around the country at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue they raise consistently is the issue Senator Harradine touched on&mdash;fair trading. They seem to me to be the two issues that are most consistently raised by small business. Frankly, I do not think I have had one small business operator raise this CGT rollover exemption for retirement products, as important as it is. They have certainly raised the new superannuation tax with me. Quite a number have raised that with me. They have certainly raised the deeming provisions at 55 as well, but not one has raised this measure you are proposing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other point Senator Harradine made, I would have to say that a number of small businesses have raised the issue of exemption from unfair dismissal provisions, but overwhelmingly the issues are customers' demand and consumer confidence. They want money through their till. They want demand in the community and they want fair trading. I think they are the priorities that small business is currently concerned with and will be concerned with for some time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5539">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to one point Senator Sherry made about the prospective application of this legislation post the date of the introduction of the capital gains tax by the Hawke Labor government. That is, of course, a statement of fact. However, when I speak about the atypical or hypothetical small business person working for a lifetime and working for decades and giving them incentives to save by investing in their own small businesses and, hopefully, at the same time, creating jobs which are much needed, we certainly think this measure will encourage people to do that. This measure is only one of many measures this government is bringing in to help small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Sherry that all small business people would like to see more cash through the till. They would like to see more consumer confidence and more people spending money. We hope that that will happen. I might also say to Senator Sherry that when I used to go around talking to small business people during the recession we had to have I got fairly harsh statements about his government. If he ever wants to see what consumer confidence can look like under a Labor government, my memory is not that short that I cannot remember conditions then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people do like the fact that interest rates have plummeted under this government. They did not enjoy 30 per cent interest rates under Paul Keating when they had to go to AGC and pay 30 per cent on business loans. We do believe that $500,000 is fair. This has become the key issue of the debate. We do believe in a small business person who has worked for a long time, even up to decades, committing themselves to investing in their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot, they have paid taxes all on their profits all the way through too. Small businesses pay tax on all of their profits, but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they also have to live on the money they make out of their small businesses. They have to pay to put shoes on their kids feet, for their clothes and to put food on the table from their small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that, if you have spent a lifetime working in a small business, and you sell the business and make a capital gain of $500,000, that will return you about $25,000 a year. Now Labor and the Democrats are saying that is too generous, that a small business person should only be able to make $250,000 at the end of their lives. They may not have superannuation. They might have put all of their savings into their small business and you are saying that $12&half; thousand a year as a retirement income after a life of hard work and toil in small business is good enough for them. We are saying it is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that small businesses should benefit from this measure. We hope that, as a result, small business people will invest in their own businesses, will create employment and will retire on a living wage at the end of that lifetime's work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the revised amendment also seeks to include personal assets of the small business person such as the person's family home.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that prior to the last election we promised that there would be very generous arrangements for Telstra employees, and we said that they would be able to take up to 500 free shares. Indeed, we set aside notionally two per cent of the float. The reality is that we are now giving them 3.8 per cent&mdash;almost double that level of allocation&mdash;and, in addition to the 500 maximum free shares that they will get, there will be an additional maximum of 200 free shares by way of loyalty entitlements for holding on to those shares for more than 12 months. So it is a very good outcome for Telstra employees, and it is not surprising, therefore, that the trade 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unions have changed their tune, obviously voting with their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CPSU's latest newsletter says that the union has announced that it will put in a claim for Telstra shares for its members as part of negotiations on a new enterprise agreement. The secretary said that there is a lot of support among members for a special allocation of Telstra shares for staff. So, quite clearly, the union knows all about having your cake and eating it. The tragedy is that Labor wants to have its cake by opposing it, and now it wants to spit the cake out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have not said `Boo' on this subject. I looked in vain for anything from the shadow minister on this subject. He has been as silent as the grave in recent months&mdash;quite clearly asleep at the wheel. We know that Senator Bob Collins is not able to be with us today. There is a glaring vacancy on the front bench but, of course, Mr Beazley cannot find anyone to make up the numbers so Senator Schacht presumably is safe for the time being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you really want to make a contribution, what you ought to do is get out there, put out a press release on the subject, tell the unions that they are right and tell them that this is actually a cooperative arrangement designed to recognise that it is a win&hyphen;win outcome for Telstra employees and for the company&mdash;and ultimately for shareholders&mdash;rather than pursuing the mindless negative opposition that we have seen over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the unions know that Kim Beazley has always been secretly in favour of the float. The tragedy is, of course, that he has been too scared to say so publicly. That is not the sort of leadership that they have been interested in and that is why they have refused to take your advice any further on this matter. It is important that the unions have been converted to the view that we have been consistently espousing&mdash;that is, that employee share ownership is a very good thing for all concerned. It offers attractive financial benefits to employees. It is good for Telstra because it gives the employees a financial incentive to improve their own performance and the company's performance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for the question. I refer him to the speech I made, on which he is obviously choosing to ask a question. On the basis of the way in which he has phrased his question, I can only assume that he has not read my speech. This government&mdash;myself, Dr Kemp, the Prime Minister, everyone in the government&mdash;is very supportive of choice in schooling, of there being a strong and effective government school system, which we have, and a strong and effective non&hyphen;government school system. That is obviously vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also recognised that not everybody will have that choice, either because of funding limitations on a family which may limit the available choice or there might be a geographic situation limiting a family's access to choice, that is, there may be only one particular school in their reasonable vicinity. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comments were certainly not indicating that there would not be any unemployment if schools performed in a different way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speech was made in the context of indicating that the environment into which young Australians are now going, if they choose to leave school early, is a much more difficult environment than it was, say, 10 years ago. I do not have the figures in front of me but I can certainly get them for you. The size of the youth labour force has drastically reduced. I think it has halved in something like a decade, so that if you now choose to leave school early&mdash;as soon as you are able&mdash;you are looking for a job in an ever diminishing number of unskilled jobs. That is why the common youth allowance, to be introduced by us next year, is so vital to young Australians. It may have been okay 20 years ago when there were a lot of unskilled entry&hyphen;level jobs, or maybe 15 years ago, but it is not okay now for a government to keep saying to young Australians, `Yes, you can leave school as early as you like. We know, if you do, you are going to make up a proportion of the long&hyphen;term unemployed. We know it is going to be harder for you to get a job, but we'll let you do it. Furthermore, we'll pay you to do it.' It is not acceptable for a government to keep doing that. That is why we have introduced the common youth allowance where we will be saying to people under 18, `If you haven't completed year 12, we aren't going to pay you an allowance or the dole to look for one of these every&hyphen;diminishing numbers of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speech highlighted the different destinations of students leaving from government schools and from non&hyphen;government schools. Government schools do have a higher proportion of students who want to look for work, and that makes vocational training even more important. It is fair to say that the whole speech, in being reduced down to a couple of paragraphs to suit the editors, has sadly been misrepresented and has not given the impression of the whole speech. That is often the case. If you want to reduce a painting down to a small aspect and look at it under a microscope, you only see one part of it. The fundamental point of the speech was that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5547"> schools which provide relevant workplace skills serve their students well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without being parochial, I took the opportunity to highlight Salisbury High in my state, and there are other schools that have an excellent record, a record which you could not beat, in providing students with what they need for the pathway that they choose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Payne for the very astute question. In the same way that we have acted to repair and protect the environment for young Australians, as Senator Hill knows, this government is committed to reducing government debt. We know and the Australian public knows that in recent times&mdash;Labor times&mdash;government debt simply got out of hand. Being in debt is always regrettable and was, in the case of Labor, simply indefensible in the extreme. It may have been different if 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5550"> there was a point to the debt that Labor created, but there does not seem to have been any point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to remember Labor's history in this respect. Between 1991 and 1995, Commonwealth debt trebled from $32.6 billion to $97.3 billion. General net government debt reached $93 billion when we came into government, which was just over 19 per cent of GDP. Our government will reduce this to around 10 per cent of GDP by the turn of the century. The underlying budget deficit when we came to government was $10.3 billion and we will be in surplus by 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, Labor spent $9 billion on the interest to pay their debts. In the year 2001, we will only have to spend just over $7 billion. That means a reduction of $2 billion per year in wasted expenditure paying interest on debt. To get an idea of how much we are talking about with the $2 billion that will no longer have to go on paying off debts: it is the amount we spend on both child care and VET each year; it is double the amount we spend on road grants each year; and it is about 40 per cent more than we spend on public hospitals each year&mdash;that is how much Labor was wasting compared with what we have been able to achieve by bringing the accounts back into order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most families spend their lives working and saving to give themselves and their families a strong foundation. They want to own their home. They want to be free from debt. They want to establish something to pass on to their children, and they want to see that their children have things a little easier than they, the parents, did. That is a very Australian attitude: doing something for the next generation, making things better for them. That is a very similar philosophy to the one that we are following in terms of bringing our finances in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of our debt reduction strategy, our young people will not be faced with a crippling debt burden. Less debt means less pressure to increase the tax burden on Australia's young people. Less debt means lower interest rates. Lower interest rates mean that housing is more affordable for young people when they want to make that invest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. Lower interest rates mean more investment and more jobs for today's young people tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing to confront and solve the problem of government debt will mean that our young people will not have to bear the burden of the sort of profligate spending that went on under Labor, which was the hallmark of Mr Keating and Mr Beazley&mdash;Homer Simpson, if you like, asleep at the wheel&mdash;living for the polls of the day, not for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia's young people faced high debt, high tax and a high interest rate future. Since our young people represent the future&mdash;and it is in them that our dreams and plans for the future will be realised&mdash;they will get the best start in life they can from this government, not the bankruptcy bomb that Mr Beazley would have dropped on them.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial council met and agreement was reached that the trial would proceed on the basis only that Australia meets its international treaty obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1972 and the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and that it is formally put to the International Narcotics Control Board and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and is not opposed by the board or by a majority of the members of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were the caveats that I mentioned. If you recall, during the estimates committee, they were the caveats that Dr Wooldridge put at that ministerial council meeting. That is the usual way for ministerial councils to operate: ministers give in principle support subject to the resolution of matters, sometimes it is significant detail being sorted out. At no stage did the Minister for Health and Family Services indicate at the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting that the Prime Minister had given his permission for the trial to proceed. That was the point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm what was stated by my colleague Senator Gibson about further cuts in interest rates. It has to be said that we are a low interest rate government, and that is in striking contrast to the practice of the Labor Party in its 13 years in office. When the Howard government came into office, home mortgage rates were around 10 per cent and rates available to small businesses were over 10 per cent. This government is particularly proud that we have been able to provide sustained interest rate relief. There have been five cuts in official interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Official interest rates have fallen by 2.5 per cent, or almost a third, Senator Sherry. This will fascinate you, Senator Sherry: home mortgage rates have fallen by almost four per cent and are lower than they have been at any time since the late 1960s. Not surprisingly, this has led to housing affordability being at record levels, which is very good news for the economy and very good news for home buyers. Indeed, the Commonwealth Bank&hyphen;HIA housing affordability index shows housing affordability to be higher than it has been at any time since December 1984. Under Labor, the dream of home ownership was getting more and more out of reach of more and more Australians. We can even recall&mdash;Senator Sherry can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that, at one stage under the Labor government, home loan interest rates soared to over 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gains from the fall in interest rates are truly dramatic. For example, on a $100,000 loan, a family's interest bill has been cut by as much as $317 a month or, in terms of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5554"> year, over $3,800 a year, since this government came to office. These interest rate cuts are flowing through to help businesses&mdash;big and small&mdash;and the economy more generally. The Labor Party used interest rates to put a brake on the economy. That is why, under the former government, the interest rate levels rose so high. I cannot recall one of the former Keating ministers ever complaining about the very high levels of interest rates which occurred during their time in government. It is no surprise that the Labor Party are regarded by the public as being a high interest rate party; they followed high interest rate policies. By contrast, we are a government that believes in low interest rates. In our first period in office we have been able to deliver comprehensively for families and business in helping to cut the level of interest rates. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to the publication of a document concerning South Pacific ministers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This document is a confidential document. It bears the legend AUSTEO, which means `for Australian eyes only'. It is the highest classification of a security document that we know of in terms of Australian national security. The national disgrace about this document is that it was left on a table in a hotel in Cairns, and all the media got access to it and all the representatives of 13 nations in the South Pacific got access to it and read the very unflattering biographies about them that someone had included in this document. These biographies were not about their policies; these biographies were about their personal habits, tastes and likes and dislikes. Of leaders in the South Pacific, things were said such as, `He likes a drink,' or `He is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drinking too much these days,' or `He is an opportunist,' and so on it goes&mdash;the sort of gossipy backgrounding that would only occur in the front bar of a hotel somewhere, encoded in an official document for Australian eyes only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a national embarrassment to Australia that this document was compiled in the first place, but it is an even greater national embarrassment that, in a cavalier way, this document found its way into public circulation and into the media. Because it did, many heads of state referred to in this document have launched considerable criticism against Australia. And, because it did, other nations that pride themselves on being secure about national secrets asked the question of Australia, `Why is it that your security is so lax that documents of this character can be freely made available to the media and create an international incident that embarrasses this nation?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the facts that are behind the question I asked Senator Hill today. My question to Senator Hill was: why did the foreign minister of Australia, Alexander Downer, do nothing to curtail or prevent the circulation of this document? Or why did Alexander Downer, the foreign minister of Australia, the minister responsible, do nothing to advise the other ministers or ONA&mdash;the agency that compiled this document&mdash;that the type of material contained in it was material that should not have found its way into an official briefing and that should not have found its way, as it did, into the public arena on this occasion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know this from the evidence that has been given at estimates committee hearings: the Department of the Treasury requested that this document be compiled. We do know this: officers of the Department of the Treasury have had their salaries reduced, their performance pay cancelled, because of their role in the compilation of this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This nation has been internationally embarrassed by injudicious and indiscreet behaviour in a matter of national security and two public servants have taken the fall. The issue is though that the buck stops with the government and the buck actually stops with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5555"> Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is his job to advise the government on whether or not material contained in documents like this is fair, whether material contained in documents like this ought to be circulated and whether material contained in documents like this ought to have greater security protection than apparently this one had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury and not the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade asked for it. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade knew about it. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sat in on the interdepartmental committee that compiled it. The minister had this document in his private possession at last three days before the conference. What action did he take to protect Australia's international interests? What action did the Minister for Foreign Affairs take to advise other ministers not to pay attention to the indiscreet references in this document? What action did the Minister for Foreign Affairs take to reassure foreign governments in advance that Australia was not prying into their private lives and using their private activities as background to be used against them in negotiations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer to those questions is that he did not take any action at all. He did nothing. He was asleep at the wheel. He did not care or did not bother. He let the thing ride. The answers to the questions given by the minister today to fob this off, to allow the Public Service to take the wrap and for the buck not to stop with the minister, are a disgrace. I think that that ought to be condemned by the Senate. We have never had a security breach that has affected 13 countries at the one time in the way this did. The minister who is absent does not take responsibility. Responsibility should be demanded of him. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have, of course, is a very sad series of events because over the years Mr Tony Street, Mr Andrew Peacock, Mr Bill Hayden and then Senator Gareth Evans put in enormous efforts to build relations through the south-west Pacific. It was always a strange relationship with Australia being a large country and the rest being so small. Those countries looked to Australia for a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leadership position on a whole range of economic and environmental issues and indeed in relation to nuclear testing in the south&hyphen;west Pacific. Whenever you hold a leadership position there is always some resentment. That resentment will now boil over to a point where repairing the damaged relations with the countries in our region is probably going to take half a decade to properly restore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You really do wonder how this series of events could have occurred. After all, the briefing notes were not that important. They were so unimportant that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) did not bother to read them until just before the meeting. For all the committee meetings to develop the briefings, for all the effort put in, this Treasurer of ours barely, according to the evidence in Treasury estimates, glanced at this briefing until the night before or the morning of the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question comes up: what happened subsequently? I think it was quite appropriate for the Inspector&hyphen;General to investigate the security breach and make recommendations and for discipline to be taken in Treasury. But that is only half the tale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened immediately after the publication in newspapers was a classic example of government departmental positioning as they each tried to slide out. I have to say that Treasury had nowhere to go. It did not take Foreign Affairs long to start their backgrounding machine, pot shotting at Treasury and the Office of National Assessments&mdash;none of which was ever directly sourced; it was always, `A spokesman in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.' The whole foreign affairs department machine got going. It shifted all the blame on to ONA and Treasury and opted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, the original conception of this meeting did not necessarily include Foreign Affairs officials or even the foreign minister. It was only over some months that they edged themselves into the conference saying that they desperately wanted to be there and it should not be just left to Treasury and Treasurers. Having shoehorned their way in, they should have adopted some sense of responsibility in the process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5556">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original answer given to us by ONA at the estimates committee&mdash;and Senator Hill complained that this was raised again today when it was raised in estimates&mdash;was that the biographical details were not sent to Foreign Affairs, not sent to AusAID and not sent to PM&amp;C. Late last week we got a letter, `Oops, sorry, we are wrong about that. They were forwarded to those three agencies on 4 July.' That is some 11 days before the meeting was to take place in Cairns. The significance of that is that those two senior departments&mdash;Foreign Affairs and Trade and PM&amp;C&mdash;had the content of those briefs 11 days before the meeting and did nothing with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill said, `Why should they? They are supposed to be held securely.' They were not and therein lies the problem. I would have thought some responsibility exists in those two senior departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Prime Minister and Cabinet to look at the content and understand that there could be a leaking or the material could go astray and what the potential embarrassment would be for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did they not say to Treasury, `Hold on fellas. This material is a bit red hot because it has all sorts of irrelevant scuttlebutt in it,' they did not even contact Treasury to ask, `What sort of security are you applying to these documents?' Surely the most inexperienced Foreign Affairs official should know that if the outer document has `Confidential' on it and pages within the document have `AUSTEO', for Australian eyes only, that particular appellation should have been at the very front of the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They picked nothing up. They are too busy positioning themselves, looking to the preening interests of their ministers and how they position them to look at the substance of the background briefing and the potential damage it could do. It is not good enough for Senator Hill to come in here today and say, `It does not really matter what is in a document. If the security is right there will never be a problem.' You always have to assume the worst. You always have to assume, either by accident or some other method, that this material may find itself in the public domain. Senator Hill finally said that this sort of thing hap 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pened under the Labor government. It did not happen in the briefings I got or any other briefings I saw.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Garfield Edward John Barwick was born on 22 June 1903 at Stanmore, New South Wales. He was educated at Fort Street Boys High School and Sydney University, where he won the university medal for law and the Dalley Prize. Before entering federal politics, Sir Garfield had already established a distinguished career as a pre&hyphen;eminent advocate and an undisputed leader of the New South Wales Bar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1927, he was appointed King's Counsel. In 1941, he practised extensively in all jurisdictions, appearing before the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Privy Council. Through a string of cases before the High Court in the 1940s, most notably the airways case and the bank nationalisation case, Sir Garfield successfully championed the rights of private enterprise against the state. During his career at the bar, Sir Garfield was President of the New South Wales Bar Association from 1950 to 1952 and from 1955 to 1956 and President of the Law Council of Australia from 1952 to 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1958. In that year, he won the New South Wales seat of Parramatta for the Liberal Party. In his maiden speech in the House, Sir Garfield spoke of the need for Australia to work for its wealth and to have workplace cooperation between employees and management to `wrest from a very great country a very great future'. He spoke of the need to curb inflation and to attract overseas investment and the importance of maintaining a balance between our imports and our exports. These are, of course, issues which remain pertinent today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Garfield ably served the Menzies government as Attorney-General and as external affairs minister. It is a testament to his immense ability that he held these two key portfolios concurrently for more than two years. His reformist reputation during these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5558"> years is perhaps best reflected in his tenure as Attorney-General when he pioneered national legislation in the areas of matrimony and trade practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1964, Sir Garfield left federal politics to become the longest serving Chief Justice of the High Court. His chief justiceship saw many significant changes: the location of the seat of the High Court in Canberra, the completion of the High Court building, the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council from all Australian courts so far as federal jurisdictions and the decision of the High Court are concerned and the divesting of less important matters from the High Court's jurisdiction to allow it to concentrate on its role as the final court on all Australian constitutional issues and the final court of appeal in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Garfield's immense contribution to public service knew no boundaries. He was Chancellor of Macquarie University from 1967 to 1968 and was President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs from 1972 to 1973. He maintained a deep attachment to conserving Australia's natural wealth by serving as a trustee of the Kosciuszko State Park for 20 years and as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation for five years. His compassion for his fellow Australians was evidenced by his service as Patron of the Australian National Council for the Blind and President of the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf and Blind Children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reflecting on the remarkable achievements of this fine Australian, it is difficult to reconcile or comprehend the sustained and vicious attacks that he had to endure for the advice he provided to the late Sir John Kerr in November 1975. It is a matter of regret that Sir Garfield's death has been used by some as an opportunity to renew these attacks. I would hope that today's motion would allow senators from all sides of Australian politics to reflect upon and rightly acknowledge a remarkable lifetime of achievement and service to Australia and its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high regard in which Sir Garfield was held is recognised by the many honours he received throughout his life. He was created a Knight Bachelor in 1953 in recognition of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his distinguished services to the knowledge and practice of the law and the administration of justice. In 1965, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1981, he was appointed a Knight in the General Division of the Order of Australia for service to Australia in parliament, government and the law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I wish to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on the death of Sir Garfield Barwick.

He held both those positions until 1964. He retired from the parliament in 1964 and was appointed by Prime Minister Menzies as Chief Justice of the High Court on the same day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Garfield Barwick was one of the most eminent political and judicial figures in Australia in the last half century. His contribution to Australian public life spanned many years and the list of his achievements is very long. Sir Garfield Barwick was born in 1903 to a middle class Methodist family. It was during these years that he learned the value of hard work and high standards. It is often quoted that his mother was his inspiration, urging him to make something of himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He won a scholarship to study arts and then law at the Sydney University where he won the 1926 university medal for law and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dalley prize. Sir Garfield Barwick practised extensively in all jurisdictions: the state Supreme Court, the High Court and the Privy Council. During his time at the bar Sir Garfield was involved in prominent cases including a highly praised appearance before the Privy Council in the bank nationalisation case, and in litigation following the controversial awarding of the Archibald Prize to Sir William Dobell for his painting of Joshua Smith. In 1941 he was appointed a KC and from 1950 to 1952, and from 1955 to 1956, he served as President of the New South Wales Bar Association and was a member of the Law Council of Australia from 1952 to 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1958, Sir Garfield Barwick stood for the New South Wales seat of Parramatta and was elected to the Menzies  government. Sir Garfield became Attorney&hyphen;General in 1959 and Minister for External Affairs in 1961, holding both portfolios until 1964. During his term he led delegations to the United Nations in 1960 and 1964 and retained his interest in international affairs when, in 1972, he became President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1964 Sir Garfield returned to law, taking up the appointment of Chief Justice of the High Court and remaining there for a record period of some 17 years. In 1975, as Chief Justice, Sir Garfield was to become part of events surrounding the dismissal of the Whitlam government. Following advice given to the Governor&hyphen;General, Sir John Kerr, Sir Garfield Barwick etched a permanent place for himself in the history surrounding this event.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Lance Herbert Barnard was born on 1 May 1919 at Launceston, Tasmania. He came from a working class background and, like many others at the time, he had to leave school during the depression. He ended up working in a timber yard for two years, went back to night school, and started training as a teacher. During World War II, Lance Barnard enlisted with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and served in the Middle East from 1940 to 1943 where he sustained permanent disabilities in his eyesight as well as his hearing in the Battle of El Alamein. After his discharge from military service in 1945, he went on to become a school teacher.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1954 he was elected to the House of Representatives in the seat of Bass, following in the footsteps of his father, Claude, who had held the seat for the ALP for 15 years. His maiden speech in the House was characterised by his concern over a diversity of issues, ranging from social issues, such as housing and the impact of high interest rates on home ownership, to issues affecting the prosperity of his home state of Tasmania, to national issues such as the need for a progressive immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1967 Lance Barnard became the Deputy Parliamentary Leader of the Labor Party and went on to become Deputy Prime Minister to Gough Whitlam in 1972. For an unprecedented period of two weeks, he and Gough Whitlam conducted a two&hyphen;man government which saw Mr Barnard holding 14 ministries and taking a series of major decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He remained as Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam ministry until 1974. He was also Minister for Defence until 1975 and, as I said, was minister for the portfolios of Navy, Army, Air and Supply until 1973. His period as Minister for Defence saw many significant initiatives, most notably the amalgamation of the three service departments and the supply department into one expanded defence department, and the decision to establish the Australian Defence Force Academy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 21 years in this parliament he contributed extensively to the work of a range of parliamentary committees, including Standing Orders, Public Accounts, Foreign Affairs and, not surprisingly, the Joint Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He left federal politics in 1975 to become Australia's Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland. In 1979, in recognition of his service to politics and government, Lance Barnard was appointed an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be remembered as a quiet, unassuming man&mdash;a quite achiever whose unswerving loyalty and personal integrity earned him the respect of all those who knew him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Labor opposition I wish to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of the Hon. Lance Barnard, former Labor Deputy Prime Minister. Labor senators express our deep sorrow at the death of Lance Barnard, and we offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Jill, and to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Deputy Leader and representative of Tasmania in the Senate it is appropriate that I make a contribution to the condolence motion on the death of the former member for Bass and Tasmanian member of federal parliament. In addition to that, I knew Lance very well personally for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance was born in Launceston in Tasmania in 1919. He came from a working&hyphen;class background. He undertook a variety of occupations in the very difficult years of the Great Depression, including, as Senator Hill has mentioned, being a timber worker for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He commenced study to be a teacher, but those studies were interrupted with the outbreak of World War II. Lance enlisted in the 2nd AIF in 1940 and served in the Middle East until 1943. At the battle of El Alamein his eyesight was partially affected as a consequence of some wounds he received and he was also partially deafened. This was while he was serving as an artillery officer. I understand also that one of his brothers died during that battle and another brother was seriously wounded. Lance himself was twice wounded during that battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war ended Lance became an active member in the Australian Labor Party. At the same time he finished his training to become a teacher. In 1954 he won the seat of Bass and held it until he resigned in 1975. The seat of Bass had previously been held by his father, Claude, who had been a minister in the Chifley government. There followed a very long and distinguished parliamentary career. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance Barnard became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in 1967. He served as Gough Whitlam's deputy&mdash;a very loyal deputy&mdash;in opposition and in government. I understand that there would have been opportunities for Lance to have become Leader of the Australian Labor Party if he had so wished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was elected to government in 1972, the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and Lance shared 27 ministries between them. Lance held 14, while the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, held just 13, until the ministery was sworn in some three weeks later. During this period some 40 major decisions were taken together by Lance Barnard as Deputy Prime Minister and Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over thirty years after enlisting in the AIF, one of Lance's 14 ministerial responsibilities was the defence portfolio. Within 72 hours of becoming defence minister, he had ended conscription and he had Australian troops brought back from Vietnam. Lance was to retain the Deputy Prime Minister and defence minister positions. He was Deputy Prime Minister from 1972 to 1974 and Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975. As Senator Hill, the government leader, has noted, one of his major achievements as Minister for Defence was the amalgamation of various defence departments and the establishment of the Defence Force Academy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance Barnard resigned from parliament in 1975 to become Australia's Ambassador to Sweden. This decision was to signal the beginning of the end of the Whitlam government. Lance's seat of Bass was won by the Liberals with a very significant swing. The rest of course is history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another scenario could have taken place. In 1973 Gough Whitlam had wanted to appoint Lance Barnard as Governor-General when the then Governor&hyphen;General, Paul Hasluck, decided not to serve another term. I think it is typical of the man and his modesty that Lance believed that our Governor-General should have a legal background, and he obviously subsequently rejected being considered for that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance not only played a key role in the Whitlam government but was one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5562"> architects behind the formulation of Labor policies throughout that period which led to Labor's election to power in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first met Lance Barnard at a Labor conference in 1971. There were a number of characteristics that immediately struck one about Lance. He was a person of very great integrity of character; he was exceptionally honest; he was a very solid individual; and he was exceptionally loyal. In fact, when reflecting on the numerous times I discussed politics with Lance, I can recall that one of the man's enduring characteristics was that on no occasion did he make a vindictive or even a critical comment about any of the persons he served with in politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Lance's most impressive characteristics following his return from overseas when he had been Australian Ambassador to Sweden was that he continued to serve the community by working very hard on its behalf. At that time I had personal contact with Lance in two areas. Firstly, he carried out a great deal of work on behalf of group training schemes in Tasmania. Indeed, right up until his death he continued to make that active contribution. Often he was here in Canberra putting forward submissions and presenting arguments on behalf of those group training schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His second area of service upon his return from Sweden involved continuing to act as an advocate for returned service men and women. Again, I recall the enormous hard work, dedication and tribunal representations that he made on behalf of returned service men and women, not least my own mother who had an issue requiring representation regarding my father who had been a merchant seaman during the war. I might say that Lance represented the issue successfully on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance continued to work in a number of other areas, particularly for Launceston, the city where he was born and grew up. He made a very active contribution to local community life, as well as on behalf of men and women throughout Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the passing of Lance, certainly in a Tasmanian context, there ends an era. He was a very important contributor not just to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national political scene but to the Tasmanian Labor Party, from World War II right through until very recent times. When reflecting on the 50 years since the war, I cannot recall a single individual who has made such a significant contribution at both state and national levels to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance's passing, as I said earlier, signifies the end of a very important postwar era for the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania. It is a death that I know my colleagues, members of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party, my mother, other members of my family and myself, all feel very deeply about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my remarks, once again I express my condolences to his wife Jill, to his family and to his friends. When I look back and reflect on Lance's career, I think if any of us can leave federal politics having made the sort of contribution that Lance Barnard has made&mdash;as a minister and to the parliament in general through the many and varied committee positions he held&mdash;at the same time maintaining the same level of integrity to politics, I think we will have done well indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With his death, unfortunately, comes the end of an era. It is a very sad time and, reflecting on that, once again may I express my heartfelt condolences to his wife Jill, his family and his friends.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lance Barnard was born in Launceston in 1919. He left school during the Depression and went to work stacking wood in a timber yard. He enlisted in the 2nd AIF in 1940 and served in the Middle East. After the war he became a teacher in Queenstown until, in 1944, he nominated for and was elected to his father's former seat, and he was then re&hyphen;elected until 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His family's connection to politics was widened when he married the daughter of a former Western Australian Labor senator, Harry Cant. Lance Barnard was known for his quiet political shrewdness and loyalty to his leader, Gough Whitlam. He served as Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975 and was instrumental in the ending of conscription and in the return of troops to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Deputy Prime Minister, Australia was governed by the distinct contrast of a quietly and deliberately spoken man beside his outspoken leader, Gough Whitlam.

I do not intend to go over the matters which my colleagues have already mentioned. I think they have dealt with all the areas. Senator Sherry, in particular, has enlightened the Senate as to the work of Lance Barnard since he returned from his ambassadorial posting, I think in 1978. I had the privilege, as did a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of you, of attending the funeral for Lance in Launceston. There were a huge number of people present. That indicated to me that people from all walks of life felt a deep loss at the passing of Lance Barnard. He was a man of the people and a thorough gentleman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a very good member for Bass and served the people to great effect. Despite the high office and the heavy burden that that office meant for him, he never turned people away. He had a deep and abiding sense of social justice&mdash;he would talk of the need for a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Barnard family had been in politics for some time. Claude Barnard, as has been said, was a member for Bass. I was speaking to one of my strong supporters in Launceston who remembered as a boy being told by his father of an incident in the 1930s when `a well&hyphen;known figure' was walking through a Launceston park and saw a fellow begging without shoes. He took his shoes off, gave them to him and walked home barefoot. That is the type of thing that the Barnards would do. Lance Barnard was similarly very generous. Incidentally, one of my staff member's parents first met at one of Claude Barnard's election night victory celebrations. So his father was a bit of a matchmaker as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal basis, I will never forget the support that Lance Barnard gave me within the councils of the Labor Party during the 1960s and early 1970s. That was not easy to do&mdash;it is certainly not very easy to support me at the best of times and these were not politically good times. Lance Barnard recognised that federal Labor would never regain office whilst there was a public perception that the federal parliamentary Labor Party was dancing like a puppet to the tune of the 36 faceless men. I say that as a matter of historical record.</PARA>

As I got older, I watched his career with more and more interest. My interest in politics stemmed in a roundabout way from that association, because in those days&mdash;back in the late 1950s&mdash;my father, who was a true&hyphen;blue Liberal, got on very well indeed with Mr Barnard. In fact, they were very good mates, but my father used to go up and down the wall every time a certain gentleman came to stay with the Barnards. That person's name is Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father used to make prophecies about the things that would happen if that person ever became Prime Minister of this country. As a young child sitting at the dinner table, I very clearly remembered all those things that my father said. My father died at a very young age, in 1970. He did not live to see the day when Gough Whitlam actually became Prime Minister. After one year of that prime ministership, I started to have a distinct feeling of deja vu about so much of what my father had said around the dinner table in about 1959 or 1960&mdash;therefore, I went out and joined the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, although my father, as I say, was a true&hyphen;blue Liberal and Mr Barnard was a Labor member of parliament, they got on exceedingly well. As my father used to say, he was such a gentleman and such a decent man. He was always prepared to listen to all

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was unaware that I was still a director of the company known as A&hyphen;CAP Development Ltd. Under no circumstances would I have treated this place with the slightest or any other contempt. By way of mitigation, I seek your indulgence to read two brief letters. The first one is under the letterhead of the Australian Securities Commission and it is dated 25 March 1993. It is written by a Mr D. Nemorin, the Manager of the Complaints Management Branch of the Australian Securities Commission. He says, inter alia:</PARA>

This letter is under the letterhead of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, chartered accounts of Perth, which is both a national and international accounting company. Coopers &amp; Lybrand has been my accountant for 15 or more years. The letter, dated 25 July 1997, is above the signature of Mr Cesare Scalise, who is a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr Scalise says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas `active service' under `Operational Service' at Section 6(1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A defined group of Australians, who served in the Malaya area, being members of the Royal Australian Navy so affected, have been wrongly excluded, whereas members of the Army and Air Force were not so excluded, and this is supported

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for benefits under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnam Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of whom appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then secretly `unallotted' to enable the introduction of the excluding legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962, which act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just prior to question time, we were dealing with our amendment No. 2. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R208">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</XREF>  as it currently stands provides for the CGT relief on up to half a million dollars to be granted where the net business asset of the taxpayer does not exceed $5 million. The opposition amendment that we are considering will extend this test by changing it to a net assets test to include all the personal wealth of a taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not believe that, when an individual retires, they only seek to live from the proceeds of business wealth; they will also access personal wealth. This being the case, it is the opposition's belief that all personal wealth should be included for the purposes of determining a taxpayer's eligibility for the half a million dollars capital gains tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same amendment that we moved to  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 , which was supported by the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine. Senator Campbell, prior to question time I was seeking from you clarification of your indication that the Democrats and Senator Harradine had not supported this amendment on the previous occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see no reason why, when a person retires with considerable business wealth, their personal wealth should be ignored in the determination of what is a very significant benefit that will be paid for by the broader Australian community and Australian families. A number of concessions are means tested by the government. A few examples are the family payment, the family tax initiative and the spouse rebate&mdash;just to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why then should taxpayers's significant business wealth of up to $5 million be excluded from their eligibility to receive capital gains tax relief of up to half a million dollars? Why shouldn't that significant personal wealth be taken into consideration? This to us is an eminently equitable measure and a fair measure. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5577">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that 97 per cent of small businesses have net business assets of under $1.3 million. So Labor does not consider the measure inappropriate as it will ensure that we are rewarding the genuine small business and their operators who have spent many years working hard to build up the asset value of their business. We do not believe that what would be considered a very small number of wealthy small business operators can consider that excluding personal wealth of up to $5 million is reasonable. We just do not believe that it is an unreasonable approach.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer anyone who is really interested to a fascinating page&mdash;page 5,507 of Friday, 27 June 1997&mdash;to see what actually happened. Roughly, that was the way they lined up. Senator Margetts was the one who was absolutely consistent. She said she was going to stick by Labor's old amendment, but the rest of the Senate was practical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government's point of view, it is important that this amendment not stand, for similar reasons to those put under Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 . But, more importantly, as  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997  now stands, by insisting on this amendment we would create inconsistency. We have already stated&mdash;I stated prior to question time&mdash;that the person 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> al assets exclusion would create added compliance costs for small business in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Margetts that the $5 million exemption is in the legislation already. Senator Margetts thinks we should put it in again, for some reason. One of the important things is that to gain the exemption under this assets threshold, you are looking at the value of the business. If you keep trying to squash this, you exclude more and more people from it. As I have said, we have just defeated the amendment in relation to halving the upper limit of the exemption relief, so that has been maintained. We believe that to do this further again restricts it, and restricts it unfairly. As I have said, it would make it inconsistent with the existing rollover provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is anything that can be learnt from the confusion in the tax act&mdash;the hundreds upon hundreds of pages of amendments and laws and delegated legislation that flows from it&mdash;one thing that would be desirable, particularly when it comes to capital gains tax rollover relief, which this forms a part of, would be to keep it consistent.

We are interested in cutting compliance costs and cutting red tape for small businesses. We are into getting small businesses to grow and create employment. We are about making the tax system fairer.

I accept that the logic of the previous measure in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) was to encourage reinvestment in small business and business growth. This is not what this bill is about. This bill is about what happens to a person and the way at least part of the capital gains tax is treated when they presumably sell the business and go into retirement.

The government's position on this is very clear. The issue of personal assets was excluded, if I can read Senator Campbell's notes accurately, for simplicity and equity reasons. The proposal which has been put forward by the Labor Party is that it will lead to a significant increase in compliance costs for small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are always anxious to try to persuade you, Senator, so I will try again. On my understanding, there are not figures available. There are simply not figures available on the number of people that are likely to be affected. It seems to me that the case that Senator Sherry has mounted is a fairly extreme case at one end of the spectrum. The fact of the matter is that, if this amendment is carried, it is more than likely that significant numbers of people who are not of the type that has been characterised by Senator Sherry will be adversely affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not possible to supply you with those figures, but it seems to me a commonsense approach would lead one to that conclusion. Senator Sherry wants to exclude what he sees as the very wealthy in relation to personal assets. In doing that, he may very well&mdash;and it is highly likely&mdash;sweep up far more people who should not be included, perhaps people whom you would be more inclined to support. The fact of the matter is that there will be additional compliance costs. It will require the valuation of personal assets. It will include the family home, I am advised. If you live in Sydney, it is not hard for the figure to rapidly mount up. Even for quite modest housing, substantial value can reside in the family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I do not have figures that I can give you, but it seems to me that this is an extreme example postulated by Senator Sherry which is likely to be one extreme of the spectrum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a figure here of $5 million. That would be a pretty pleasant house on the leafy foreshores of Sydney Harbour. I want to challenge your contention of simplicity, Senator Kemp. If a person is to benefit from this measure and the previous measure that we were dealing with before the break, they have to work out&mdash;presumably they get their accountant to do this&mdash;the net value of their assets. That would, in many circumstances, be quite complex. I assume 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5581"> they would go to their accountant, business adviser, et cetera, to have the value of those assets and the value of their business calculated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that would be much more complex than providing a schedule of their personal assets. If it is a car or a house, I cannot see how it is complex to provide that sort of basic information. If it is a long list of personal assets and it includes the yacht, the silverware, the paintings and all the other things that you claim are a bit extreme, it will take a bit more time. Even then it would not be, I would submit, as complex as meeting the requirements of your measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you are seeking advice, I would reinforce this point: we are not dealing here with the exemption from capital gains tax on the sale of a business and the purchase of another business; we are dealing here with a person actually retiring and purchasing a retirement product, which is different. The person has made their contribution. It has been recognised in the measure that was approved in tax bill No. 1. It is being recognised here with a measure that is very beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not argue with the principle. We have already had that debate anyway in the previous amendments. We do not argue that small business deserves to be recognised. Our concern is for fairness and equity; that no-one else in the community will enjoy a benefit that anywhere near matches this type of benefit. When a person obtains a pension, part or whole, they are subject to asset and means testing of their pension. Not to include some sort of assessment of personal assets when we are extending yet another benefit to small business in this case seems to us to be very inequitable and unfair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to make some sense of that for the lay person. In my speech on the second reading earlier today I set out the history of this provision. In short order, the government announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget that it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5583"> would close off what it characterised as a loophole in this act by removing the right of prospectors to a tax exemption when they sold their prospect for mining development. The opposition&mdash;that is, the Labor Party&mdash;supported that change, but with the very strong caveat that this new provision should not act retrospectively and that there should be some sensitivity shown to the interest of those people who had been developing leases for sale and the costs that they had incurred in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it was not only the opposition that said that. The Senate economics committee, inquiring into this legislation, came to the same conclusion in principle and said so. My recollection is that that was a unanimous decision of that committee. When they embarked on putting forward the changes to the bill that they have before the Senate now, the government did so in the sure and certain knowledge that they were flying in the face of a unanimous decision of the Senate economics committee. That has not deterred the government; they have persisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that I propose by this amendment are changes which would grandfather the rights of prospectors from the time at which the so&hyphen;called closing of the loophole change took effect, that is, 20 August 1996. Those people who had had a right to, and a normal expectation of, exemption from taxation and who had incurred costs in that knowledge&mdash;costs that they may not otherwise have incurred had they known that they would be taxed&mdash;would be able to be retrospectively protected. In my considered view, the only sure way of doing that is the sweeping type of catch&hyphen;all amendment that does that, the amendment that I have just now moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In being fair to the history of this subject, I might say  that, last year when my amendment that I have just moved was defeated, another amendment was moved by my colleague Senator Murray, representing the Australian Democrats. His amendment was then carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was persuaded at the time&mdash;and I believe that it was the case&mdash;that Senator Murray believed that his amendment was going to fix 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this loophole. Indeed, it seems to me that many of the senators in the chamber at the time believed that retrospectivity would be properly dealt with by the Murray amendment&mdash;albeit in a more stringent form than would have been the case in the one that I moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that retrospectivity has not been dealt with and that therefore the government are proposing to change the law by introducing their amendment so that the tax office can give effect to this change&mdash;there being some problems in the Murray amendment&mdash;but they are not answering the retrospectivity question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I hope I have put the issue in some context. I think this amendment should be carried. In fact, it is the only effective way of guaranteeing that the retrospectivity of the provisions that the government is proposing to enact is guarded against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing the debate on the second reading, Senator Campbell, a Western Australian senator, said that there was no retrospectivity involved in the government position&mdash;which was quite extraordinary from him. Of course, that is not true. The government's position does allow for retrospective taxation in this particular case. All I can understand from Senator Campbell's comment is that he has not applied himself to this industry's needs; nor has he understood at all what the nature of these changes that he is advocating to this chamber is. That is a cross that he is going to have to bear, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument that he put in closing the debate on the second reading is that the cost of revenue forgone, if my amendment were to succeed, has increased with better and new figuring from the department. I had understood that the cost was in the order of $65 million and that that `so&hyphen;called' cost was revenue that rightly ought to go to the Commonwealth which, because of this amendment, would not go to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That figure has moved from $65 million to the more impressive three&hyphen;digit figure of $100 million: an exact, precise $100 million, not $101 million or $99.3 million but exactly $100 million. We are being asked to believe 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5584"> that on new and better figuring it is precisely $100 million&mdash;no cents involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are asked to believe it by assertion. There is no argument adduced to show us why the figures have changed, no presentation of figuring, no exposure of the assumptions on which this figure is calculated so that we can test whether this figure is right or wrong, but I do know that the cost of revenue forgone is being used here as a telling argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now say something about the extraordinary change in the cost of revenue forgone and the fact that it is now precisely $100 million. That is not a cost to revenue. If you accept the principle that this is a retrospective principle&mdash;which of course it is, a principle accepted by the Senate economics committee&mdash;then the so&hyphen;called cost to revenue is the amount of revenue to be obtained by retrospectively taxing activities that were lawful at the time and when people who were carrying them out believed them to be lawful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the amount of tax achieved by retrospective application. You can characterise it, if you wish, as revenue forgone. I think the fairer characterisation of it would be that this is the amount of retrospectivity the government expects to obtain. Put in that light&mdash;which is the only reasonable light for it to be presented in, in my submission&mdash;I think that, whatever the figure is, it shows the enormity of the principle of retrospective taxation in this case and how negative retrospective taxation in this case is. It is negative to the tune of $65 million&mdash;no, on later figuring it is negative to the tune of $100 million, that is, $100 million of tax revenue to be garnered from people who thought they were doing lawful things at the time and now find, because of the passage of this legislation, that they are not doing lawful things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle that the government cleaved to assiduously in opposition was to oppose retrospective legislation in taxation. They might wish now to argue that this is not true retrospectivity, but they would have to jump over the findings of the Senate economics committee report to do so. The point is that they argued strenuously in opposition that retrospectivity should not apply, yet in government their tune has changed. Here they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are exacting, on the figures we have, $65 million, $100 million&mdash;or some other figure you can think of and pencil in&mdash;as the amount of retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may argue in any case, `So what.' I remind the Senate that the `So what' here applies to an important industry sector in Australia&mdash;the mining industry. While most of the prospectors concerned may be prospectors for gold&mdash;and certainly the government has an argument to answer about its treatment of the gold industry in recent months&mdash;it is also the truth that this industry sector refers to a lot of other minerals as well, and I read the list of those into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in my speech during the second reading debate. It was quite an exhaustive list of the many other minerals to which this exemption applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the gold industry, we do know that the sale of bullion by the Reserve Bank achieved an income to our national accounts of $2.5 billion, but it wiped over $2 billion off the value of shares held by investors in gold. In many respects, it was a direct transfer from the pockets of Australian gold investors to the pockets of Treasury. That is the economic effect of the sale of bullion. So you can argue that at one level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the other level, the important thing is that it has depressed the price of gold. At a time when the market has been artificially driven down by government action, we now have a situation in which, retrospectively as well, people who work in this sector are to be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could argue, on the basis of degree of pain, that the degree of pain being inflicted on this industry is to pile pain on top of pain, and if you say, `So what,' you are approving the fact that even more pain should be exacted here&mdash;that when an industry is down we should tax it even harder. I think that is a proposition that most ordinary Australians would say does not fall under the heading of a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have moved my amendment. I have two other amendments foreshadowed in case this amendment does not succeed, but I hope they will not be necessary. Before I resume my seat, if the Assistant Treasurer is going to reply in this debate&mdash;and I think he ought 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5585"> to&mdash;in his reply I ask him specifically to tell the chamber what, in his view, is the cost of revenue forgone by this measure; how that cost was calculated; what the assumptions were; and on what basis the figure was arrived at.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be helpful if the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) had everybody's views and then responded appropriately. A character in Western Australia who is a prospector said that, if the government is determined to bury this scheme, at least it should give it a decent burial. The point that Senator Cook has made yet again is that that has not yet been done. Hopefully, this debate will finally do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the Senate economics committee, along with Senator Cook, which originally examined this government proposal. We were, as Senator Cook rightly said, unanimously distressed at the retrospective and unfair consequences of the government's action as intended at that time. We are all aware that prospectors undertake the most difficult and the highest risk task in the mining industry and they are primarily a small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bill came before the Senate last December, it was at a time when there was a flurry of bills and it was the end of the session. The result was a fair bit of stress while these matters were being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook did put up his amendment and I put up an amendment. The government clearly understood that they did not have the numbers and they should accede to the general principles we were spelling out&mdash;that is, with respect to these conditions under paragraph 23PA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, prospective rights were necessary in order to prevent retrospectivity. That was because mining activity undertaken by prospectors was only realised in the future, and if you cut it off on 20 August 1996&mdash;which was the government's intention&mdash;it would result in a huge loss of income and benefits to those engaged in prospecting at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were persuaded by the industry advocates&mdash;although some of them wanted a lot longer&mdash;that five years was a reasonable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period in which to resolve the issue of disposing of their interest in any particular claim. The government did accept that five years. Their legislation now, in terms of the amendment they accepted, states that you had to be a bona fide prospector prior to and at the date of 20 August 1996 and that you would have five years in which to dispose of your asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when I put up my amendment, which was somewhat narrower than that proposed by Senator Cook, the government came to me and said, `We understand where you're going. We're prepared to accede to your request. We would like to amend it,' and they presented me with an amendment which subsequently passed the Senate under my name. I took that on trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness to the government, at that time they were under a great deal of pressure to produce the appropriate wording to get the result that was required. I recall a meeting with the Treasurer in his office at which we agreed the relevant terms of the amendment. That was on 12 December 1996. On 13 December the faxes started coming through from the prospectors saying that they were alarmed about certain aspects of it. That is to be expected but, nevertheless, some of the things that they raised did occasion me some concern. So on 24 December 1996, questions on notice went through to the Treasurer. On 22 April&mdash;119 days later&mdash;they finally replied to those questions on notice. I do not take kindly to a lack of cooperation and I will record that in my memory bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the credit of government, they recognised that there have been some problems with the amendment and what had happened and they had, in March, introduced the amendments that we now see before us. On 2 May 1997, I wrote to the Treasurer with a rather fulsome amendment to see whether that would meet some of the concerns I still had. On 7 August&mdash;66 days later&mdash;we finally got a response. As the Democrats only have seven senators, I carry nine portfolios so I am pretty busy, but I think 119 days for a question on notice to be responded to and then 66 days for a letter to be responded to is not competent or efficient.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5586">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, about a week or two ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Campbell, entered the scene. He has since proven efficient and competent and has been on my back about these amendments of Senator Cook's, which I welcome because the lack of interest, involvement or concern of the Treasurer and his department is regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have before us does go some way, but not all the way, to meeting the genuine concerns of the prospectors at losing a benefit which they had every right to believe should not be taken away from them retrospectively. I was persuaded by the government that my own amendment, which was rather fulsome, went too far, and I am not persuaded by the prospectors that we have to attend to the valuation issue. There is a ruling in FC of T v. Tully Cooperative Sugar Milling Association Ltd, 83 ATC 4495 (1983), 14 ATR 495 per Fox at ATC 4500, ATR 500 which says, `As a general rule, taxation provisions that provide a benefit are not to be defeated by an illiberal approach.' Basically speaking, that means that the valuations which prospectors bring forward should be treated on their merits and not illiberally by the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the amendments before us, my particular concern is that prospectors should be capable of getting rid of their asset in a manner which most suits their intention and their needs. That means that in many respects they may wish to sell that asset or that right to a mining house on a conditional sale basis. In other words, they receive the money for their asset after the sale&mdash;post facto. However, as I read the legislation, they would be restricted in doing so in terms of the withdrawal of the 23(pa) provision because that provision only applies at the time the income was derived. In other words, you only get the benefit at the time you receive the money. So if you sell something now and receive the money later, you are not going to get the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, the Labor amendment which meets that most important provision is the item at amendment 3. Amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 561&mdash;and we are just dealing with amendment 1 at this time&mdash;it is my belief, go a little too far and I think it is time to give 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this thing a decent burial. It will be my intention to recommend that the Australian Democrats do not support the opposition in amendments 1 and 2, but support them in amendment 3.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, we are seeking to attempt to make the amendments of 12 December workable. Senator Cook is seeking to revisit the whole issue, which was very extensively canvassed and debated during that period. The Senate then resolved to defeat the approach of the Labor Party, and the amendment as originally proposed by Senator Murray was passed. But, as I said, for a variety of reasons it was not workable. That was well recognised. Senator Murray, I will pass on your kind remarks to Senator Campbell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to Senator Cook's comments. There are, frankly, I think, some general problems with the amendment that Senator Cook has moved. A point which should be made is that the Labor amendments ignore the situation which arose after 1 July 1997. As I said, the government's amendments are essentially about making the Senate's amendment of December 1996 work. Two acts need amendment: the 1936 and the 1997 tax acts. I think Labor's amendments ignore the 1997 act, so there is a technical problem with the way you have drafted your amendments. I am not saying the problem could not be rectified. We are not seeking for you to rectify it; we are seeking to have the amendments defeated. I put that on notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to Senator Cook's first amendment, that amendment removes three conditions from the provision: the sunset clause, the limitation on exempt income to the market value of the mining right as at 20 August 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5587"> 1996, and the requirement that the person receiving the exemption is a bona fide prospector when the income is derived. The government opposes this amendment because it broadens the phase&hyphen;out of the exemption far beyond that which the parliament agreed to on 12 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook's proposed amendment grandfathers the exemption indefinitely for those rights which were acquired before the government's 1996 budget night announcement. It would exempt from tax any increase in the value of those rights which were acquired before budget night 1996. It only requires the taxpayer to have been a bona fide prospector at a non&hyphen;defined period in the past. We believe that, apart from the technical problem, Senator Cook's amendment broadens it far beyond the way the parliament sought to agree to last December. Therefore, we will be opposing the first amendment, the second amendment and the third amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you asked for the assumptions. The average years for prospecting on a tenement are assumed at four years. The cost of the revenue due to the exemption is $40 million per year. A further assumption is that 10 per cent of bona fide prospectors will not be bona fide when the income is derived.</PARA></SPEECH>

Firstly, he said that these provisions in your amendments would cost $100 million as opposed to $63 million. So we do need an answer on that figure. Secondly, he said that he wished me to defeat or refuse all three amendments because the government and the Liberal Party&mdash;and, I guess, the Liberal Party in Western Australia&mdash;did not want to support any of those three amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has not actually answered my question&mdash;he has given me some assumptions upon which the calculation was made. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> But the figure which was provided to us was $63 million. We are now told extemporaneously&mdash;as far as I am concerned, anyway&mdash;at the end of the second reading speech that it is $100 million. You have announced some nebulous reasons, some nebulous assumptions, about this. You are quoting from a document. It would help this debate if the calculations that you have made could be tabled and subject to some scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is quite a dramatic change. You have not said where you got it wrong to begin with; why you now believe you are right; and why, if you conduct further scrutiny, you will not correct yourself again. I might say in passing, with some degree of bitter cynicism, I have never yet encountered a situation in which, when the government is under pressure and produces a new figure for what the lost revenue will be, the lost revenue is less. That has never happened. The lost revenue is always more. It is always dramatically more, as if the lost revenue can be waved around as an asserted figure and as the clincher to all argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has to do better than this. If it is trying to threaten people by saying, `You are damaging revenue to this amount,' well, prove it. I am asking you, Minister, to therefore table the document from which you have been quoting so that we can have a look and satisfy ourselves that what you are saying is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for the government to correct its reputation here. We have just had the honest and forthright report to this chamber from Senator Murray about what happened last time. Now, I was an actor in what happened last time and I have a very clear recollection of what happened last time. Senator Murray had an amendment circulated in the chamber which we thought was the amendment he would move but, at the very last minute, he moved a slightly different amendment. It has always confused me as to why that was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now been told the reason was that he has had discussions with the Treasurer and he and the government agreed. The amendment that Senator Murray moved then was carried and is now the law, but that is now 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5588"> what the government is wanting to change. This is not a very good track record for the government: it sorted out the amendment that is now the law and that it now wants to change. Why could the government not draft its own amendment at the time accurately? The law as it now stands, the amendment that it proposed to Senator Murray, is unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not only can you get your arithmetic wrong as to the damage that there might be to revenue&mdash;this is the amount of money the government is seeking to unfairly retrospectively recover&mdash;but you cannot even draft your own legislation when you broker a deal to get a majority of votes in this chamber. So you do not have a great basis of credibility, with the greatest of respect to you, Minister&mdash;because I am not sure if you were the minister at the table at the time&mdash;in coming into this chamber and making assertions unsupported by any other detail. In fact, on the record, you are not to be trusted at all by any assertions that you make because, first, you cannot calculate the figure and, second, you cannot draft a change to the legislation. I ask you, Minister: will you now make all your calculations available to the chamber?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I have moved this amendment because I believe this is a more literal translation of what was intended by the Senate when it last deliberated on this provision at the end of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am mindful that my Senate colleagues representing the Australian Democrats, the Greens and now Senator Harradine have all indicated that they will not support this amendment on the argument thus far produced. Obviously, the government will not either&mdash;it has called for all of my amendments to be defeated. You do not have to be Einstein to know that, therefore, I am without a majority in this chamber at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do, though, out of respect to the chamber, want to take some moments to present some arguments which ought to be considered before this amendment is put aside. I think this amendment, given the failure of the first amendment, should be carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two issues here are issues that have been set out in correspondence to me by the Australian Minerals Council and by various prospectors. Those issues relate to the question of a prospector not being entitled to an exemption unless he satisfies the test of being a bona fide prospector&mdash;which we do not object is an appropriate test&mdash;when he sells the lease, transfers it or assigns his right to mine and at the time in which the income is derived from the sale of the lease transfer or the assignment of his rights. Both those tests have to be satisfied: he or she has to be a prospector when he or she sells it and he or she has to be a prospector when income is derived from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the provisions of this amendment would mean that they only have to be prospector at the time in which the lease is sold. I think there is a fair bit of argument here to justify that as a reasonable proposition. One has to understand the goldmining industry or the mining industry to understand the proposition. It is clear the government does not. It is surprising to me that Senator Campbell from Western Australia does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For income to be derived may mean that, after the sale of the lease, a payment is made directly and the income is derived, and there is no substantial difference in time between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the agreement to sell and the deriving of the income. It is frequently the case that there is a considerable delay in which the income is properly derived. No-one is foxing here. It is the nature of the industry that sometimes the income is derived by means of shareholding equity, a return on the mining venture or matters of that nature. The delay can be up to years. Certainly, it is not unsurprising if it is for several months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this provision is asking for is that a person remain a prospector until such time as they have received payment upon the agreement to sell, whether or not they choose to remain part of the industry. Given the price of gold, which this government has helped to depress, and given the more onerous natures of these taxing provisions, there are a number of prospectors who will not choose to remain part of the industry. Why should they be kept artificially prospecting or actually prospecting until such time as payment is made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point is strenuously made to me by the AMEC in notes that it has provided to me about its concerns about this provision. I have referred to that extensively in my speech during the second reading debate. Let me go to a couple of other points that I made during the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of exempt status could arise where the purchaser moves onto the area and carries out extensive work such that the field work of the prospector is subsequently swamped by the purchaser's field work. So when you are talking about what the value of the field work done by the prospector is in order to make a valuation, as you are required to in the provision as the government now proposes it, how do you make that valuation when, immediately upon a sale, the purchaser can go along and conduct further and different work? You have got to have someone there at the site all the time. It just makes a ridiculous proposition. I put that to the government as well and ask the minister whether he can answer that question. What happens in the situation where a purchaser has done subsequent work which blanks out or swamps the field work done by the prospector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I make is that there is no evidence that the exemption was previously 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5592"> allowed only when the taxpayer could prove that they were a bona fide prospector at the time the income was derived. So given that there was no evidence that that was the past practice, perhaps the minister would like to enlighten the chamber as to why it is now proposed to introduce it as a new practice. I do not think there is any evidence to show that it was the case previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if one wants to say that this practice now ought to be introduced, while we are going through the transitional phase of introducing a new tax&mdash;a tax that did not exist before&mdash;I would suggest that it is advisable to tread easily and carefully and not to put up onerous provisions during the transitional stage. Allow the provision that I have moved to reflect the entitlement for exemption at the point of sale and not when the income from that sale has been derived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also further say that a case decided at tax law, admittedly under old section 23(p), which the minister should be aware of, is the Biggs case. That involved a number of transactions which delayed settlements. My advice is that the court made no inquiry in that case as to the work carried out by the purchaser after the prospector had sold the tenements; further, the commissioner in that case did not raise any questions. So there is no particular material difference in the wording between that part of old 23(p) and the part that we are now looking at. So perhaps the minister might answer for me why he therefore thinks the provision should now be included when, in the particular case that was decided on in this matter, the extra work that was done was not considered an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally on this point, the ATO in its tax ruling on bona fide prospectors makes it clear that the status of a bona fide prospector is determined at the time of disposal, not when the proceeds are received. To back my assertion, I will quote the following extracts from tax ruling 92/19 issued by the Australian Taxation Office in 1992. I think they prove that the government and you, minister, are wrong in your assertion that this represents a change of policy, because the policy has always been to determine eligibility for section 23(pa) exemption at the time the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights to mine are disposed of. In TR 92/19, under the heading `Future field work,' point 7 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Field work carried out after a prospector disposes of rights to mine the relevant material doesn't affect the prospector's claim to have carried out the major part of the field work when the rights were disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is fair enough. Then section 48 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A prospector may have carried out the whole or a major part of the field work at the time the rights to mine are sold, transferred or assigned. Any further field work after that disposal (by the prospector or by someone else) is irrelevant to the application of paragraph 23(pa). So further prospecting by future parties will not affect the status of a prospector when the rights to mine are disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I draw your attention to those concluding words: `when the rights to mine are disposed of'. Those are probably more than enough questions to go on with for the moment. But in trying to be complete within the time allocated to me, the other element here concerns the fact that you will need to obtain a valuation of the lease. There are certain rules about how valuations of mining leases are obtained. The Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy sets out a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Code and guidelines for assessment and valuation of mineral assets and mineral securities for independent expert reports</EMPHASIS> &mdash;that is, the Valmin code, which was issued in June 1995. I am sure you are familiar with this code, minister, so you might explain to me why it is you are proposing legislation which transgresses it. More importantly, in terms of weight of argument at least, the Australian Securities Commission, which is of course the government regulatory authority, has a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Practice note 43 on valuation reports and profit forecasts</EMPHASIS> . That practice note was released in 1993. Practice note 43, paragraph 48, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complex valuations in an expert's report necessarily contain significant uncertainties. Because of this an expert who gives a single point value will usually be implying spurious accuracy to his or her valuation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on. I put that to you in terms of the type of valuation that is now required by the tax office in order to assess the value at the particular point of the mining lease. The Securities Commission does not believe that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5593"> that type of valuation has credibility. So why do you, minister, believe it has? I think these are the two major deficiencies in what the government's position is. My amendment No. 2 will clarify those and resolve them. I hope that the chamber may be persuaded to join me in voting to do that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to ask Senator Cook for some clarification because most of the arguments he has given in asking the chamber for support for amendment No. 2 have related to the anomaly that he sees in relation to whether or not waiting for the money to be paid over is a sensible time to be required for a bona fide prospector. That we thought might have been reasonable. As far as we can see, amendment No. 3 deals with that issue. So what is there in amendment No. 2 that is different in relation to that issue? Most of the argument that perhaps the majority of the chamber is attracted to is addressing that anomaly as simply as possible. There are other elements within amendment No. 2 which make it broader, as far as I can see, than simply addressing the definition of the time at which a person was a prospector not restricting it to when the money was transferred. Why would amendment No. 3 not deal with that situation?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

In being conscientious to try to put the whole case I certainly may have won the case that was already won for amendment No. 3 but did not spend sufficient time on the other elements of amendment No. 2 that are worth while and make the difference between voting for it or not voting for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point is that if you simply make amendment No. 3 there will still need to be a valuation obtained. The valuation will be a single point valuation. My argument here is that there are codes of conduct for valuations in the mining sector. Valuations are obtained all the time for particular reasons. Valuations of mining opportunities can be fraught with great difficulty if one is not careful about setting down the basis for them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two codes that deal with this. One is the Valmin code, which is the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy code. That code is supported by the Australian Stock Exchange and is endorsed by the Minerals Council of Australia as the appropriate code to use when assessing the value of a mining lease. I will not read all of the code. Paragraph 57 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the extent of data available permits,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a range (high/low) of values must be determined and stated reflecting uncertainties in the data and the interaction of the various assumptions that have been applied. In all cases, the most likely Value must be identified, unless there are cogent reasons stated in the report for not doing so: and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Report must include a sensitivity analysis showing the effects of changing the most significant assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data used must not be invalid due to the passage of time and its cut&hyphen;off date, which must be disclosed in the Report, must be as close as practicable to the date of the Report or the Valuation Date, as may be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In essence it says what the parameters are that might be changed, how you identify those and how you cannot arrive at a single point valuation. I am advised that many independent experts in fact refuse to quote a most likely value on the basis that it cannot be reasonably determined. Where a most likely value is determined it is generally at the median between the high and low values and is therefore of little significance. That is from the Valmin code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Securities Commission at paragraph 38 in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Practice note 43 on valuation reports and profit forecasts </EMPHASIS>states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complex valuations in an expert's report necessarily contain significant uncertainties. Because of this an expert who gives a single point value will usually be implying spurious accuracy to his or her valuation. An expert should, however, give a narrow range of values as possible. An expert report becomes meaningless if the range of values is too wide. An expert should indicate the most probable point within the range of values if it is feasible to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the relevant extract. Both these guidelines to valuation show that you cannot simply make a single point valuation. My amendment would not require you to do so. It would avoid that point and make the  appli

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before speaking on my opposition to schedule 10 I would like to make some brief comments about schedule 3 and also ask some questions in relation to schedule 9. Schedule 3 makes changes to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R194">Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . I wanted to point out with these minor modifications in the Income Tax Rates Act as yet more wrinkles come to light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you remember when we dealt with the family tax initiative? It was the Greens (WA) who offered the government a simpler way of achieving the same amount of benefit to families. It was the government choosing to do things in a way which looked as though they were giving people $1,000, even if they were giving them roughly $200, that created the difficulty. Here we have perhaps the first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of many endeavours to fix up the problems which occurred because of that desire to make something look like something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, this is attempting to pass off a rebate as something else while maintaining a relatively constant $200 benefit regardless of the rate the taxpayer is paying. So it is fiddling with the rates, and we knew it was going to be a constant problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to schedule 9, we have increasing age for superannuation contributions. This requires compulsory superannuation payments to continue to be made in respect of people over 65. There is no requirement for people to work until this age. I suspect that this is nevertheless a measure designed to push back retirement age&mdash;at least conceptually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to find out and seek some assurance about whether or not there are moves by the coalition to put up the retirement age, particularly considering the fact that they are putting out a policy of running down superannuation for those unemployed after the age of 55. Perhaps we will find a time when people will not be able to choose to retire at 55; they will be required to run down their superannuation and maybe there will be an official retirement age which is after 65. I would like the reassurance that this is not on the books for the coalition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, by this proposal and by increasing the age at which individuals are generally allowed to make superannuation contributions, we are seeking to help those who have had poor access to superannuation in the past. In our view, by providing a longer period in which to accumulate an adequate retirement income, this will benefit women who leave the work force to care for children and it will benefit other individuals whose work force experience is characterised by breaks. This reflects, among other things, the increasing longevity of the work force and will lead, we believe, to an increase in retirement savings. We think that the measures are welcomed and that they reflect current developments. I am not sure, Senator, what more I can add to assist you.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not view this measure with concern. As I understand it, at the moment if a person works beyond 65&mdash;I have had a case referred to me personally about this matter&mdash;they can have SG paid on their behalf up to the age of 70. But if a person is working beyond 65, it is not compulsory, and this is what this change does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, I think that the critical issue is the age at which the pension is paid&mdash;and that is 65. Any government that wants to tackle that issue&mdash;and I certainly would not suggest that Labor would be tackling it, nor would I would want to increase the age at which the government provided that to pensioners. It is 65; it is in statute. I suggest that any government that wants to do that would be very brave indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to you that there already have been changes to pension age&mdash;especially in relation to women moving up from 60. So these questions about general retirement age are not coming out of thin air. I would like to know what the current level of unemployment is for people between the age of 55 and 65, compared to, say, people between 40 and 45. The reason I am asking this is that when someone becomes unemployed after 50 it frequently means that they become unemployable, and the problem increases with age. The treatment of over&hyphen;55s, that  is, to require them to run down their assets, obviously has to be realistic with the level of employment and unemployment at that age. Do you have any rough figures of the relative levels of employment for those two groups?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

I do not know whether we can do anything in the dinner break, but we will see whether there is any further information that we can provide. Unusually, I thought that Senator Sherry expressed the issue on retirement age rather well. I do not think I need to add anything further to Senator Sherry's remarks, except that Senator Sherry raised the matter of the SG being payable after 65 and the advice we receive is that this

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I just think that this is a rather odd contrast. You are working to create legislative support for those who work beyond 65, and that in fact could be seen as an encouragement. In times of high unemployment that ought to be taken into consideration. For those who are spouses of well&hyphen;heeled partners it does seem a bit odd that the treatment of over-55s who would choose to retire is becoming shabbier whilst you are choosing to create incentives for those who might voluntarily choose to work past 65.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are options that recognise the diversity among people. There are people who wish to work after 65 and there are those who do not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be some people&mdash;and I am sure you have heard of some and we have heard of others&mdash;who would prefer as their own option to remain in the work force. That is what they wish to do, but the retirement age for aged pension purposes, as Senator Sherry said, is 65. For women, that age is moving towards 65. I have nothing further to add.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except that you have said, Senator Kemp, that the government acknowledges that there would be people below the age of 65 who would like to retire earlier. Could you explain to the Senate what incentives the government is providing for those people who desire to retire but cannot because of the fact that they need to receive income right up until they are 65? Is the government going to provide similar incentives for them to retire early, just as they are proposing to give incentives for those who reach the age of 65 and work until they are 70? I will have a bit more to say about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry mentioned that there were some Treasury people looking at this. This really is one of the most interesting proposals presumably emanating from the fertile Treasury mind, because this particular proposal is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5599"> going to be a net saving to the government at least in the first two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did see some figures which said that 12 per cent of males eligible for that particular incentive will actually be dead before they receive any payment, but of course they will be working away and paying tax in the meantime. I think that was a very important point that was raised by Senator Margetts. If we cannot have the information from the minister now, I would like to hear what may emerge after dinner.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That certainly is what we were getting at&mdash;that, basically, there seems to be a very odd thing going on in relation to commonsense choices within the community and whether or not the government is making punishments or incentives for certain behaviour to take place. We want to know what the rationale for all that might be at a time of high unemployment and when the youth are actually being blamed for being young and unemployed. I would appreciate further information perhaps after the dinner break.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might at this stage mention my proposal for schedule 10, which is to oppose the schedule. This is basically looking at the whole issue of whether you can pick out a particular group of otherwise fortunate people and say, `We're going to give you a special deal for putting aside money as potentially a tax dodge and give you the taxpayers' money to do it.' We would like to see that whole schedule looked at. There are a number of amendments to alter this schedule and they are only pertinent if our attempt to oppose the schedule fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, we see the spouse superannuation contribution as a perk for the rich and as the pursuit of the coalition's so-called family policy, which seems to consist of trying to bribe or penalise people into a structure where one partner is out working and the other is at home&mdash;no marks for guessing which gender goes where. For the less intelligent, I refer them to the family tax initiative, where the government makes clear that the purpose of the partner staying home is to `look after the kids', though this measure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not have that effect. I oppose this measure on both grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disgusted at the way this government rewards the wealthy while cutting back services used by the poor and the middle class. It is worse when this government pretends to be pursuing the rich while calling all its perks for the rich `a benefit for the battlers'&mdash;ordinary workers in the case of the savings scheme, small businesses with the CGT and spouses at home, for which we read women in this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dislike the way that, in this case, often the media seems to repeat what the government says without considering whether or not what it is saying is true. This is not a measure for spouses. It is a measure for the rich, so they can arrange their affairs to pay a little less tax. Even with the amendments that may be made&mdash;putting an income and assets test on the taxpayer and limiting the operation to the unmarried, and therefore, less protected spouses&mdash;this will still be a measure that will support primarily upper management, people with a far higher income than most. We would like to say that we oppose the schedule and we recommend that other senators do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a vacuum, it may be a good thing that these management executives be given incentives to give superannuation to their spouses, but we are not here in a vacuum. It is a proposal to give $38 million in tax breaks to the well-off, and it must be put in the context of cuts to health, education programs and so on that will affect every parent. It must be put in the context of changes, the intent of which is to make young people economically dependent on their parents until they are in their 20s. Those changes will affect all parents, whether or not they are well-off, and it will affect single parents and divorced and separated parents. This little perk goes only to the well&hyphen;off and only to families living together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 86, the explanatory memorandum makes it very clear that the definition of spouse does not include a partner who does not live with their husband `even though legally married'. So we are not talking about providing independence. The Greens (WA) oppose schedule 10 in the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, there is no incentive at all for a rich person to provide superannuation for even a married partner if the taxpayer is living somewhere else for work reasons or if the partners are separated, perhaps trying to work things out. There is no incentive for providing anything to a separated partner, even if that partner is not working because they have the children. It is not a measure which many feminists in our society would think would be worthy of support because it provides a level of independence, because it specifically does not do that&mdash;it cannot do that. It is not a measure to look after people. The tax revenue that is deferred here would be better collected and used to provide for all families, not just rich families. I ask other senators to seriously consider whether or not it would be better to provide benefits for all families than simply to support the rich and only the rich in a lifestyle that the government finds socially appealing&mdash;the one where wives stay at home with the kids.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, we are moving a long way from the traditional notion of government providing universal benefits for all. Such benefits are generally acknowledged as minimum standards for society. Such measures are being dismantled and replaced, either with nothing or with heavily targeted charity measures which, increasingly, for people to receive they need to show they are totally impoverished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of older unemployed people over 55 with some superannuation, the government demands that they use those resources and totally impoverish themselves before they can even get unemployment benefit. This is breadline mentality, and guess what? It creates consumer uncertainty&mdash;I put that as an aside. It counters the notion that unemployment is meant to provide for people in transition from one job to another. Unfortunately, there are few jobs available. Dumping all the rhetoric, the statistics show that, where jobs are available, unemployment in almost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any time or country falls to around 1.5 per cent&mdash;that being people in transition from job to job. Those people are actually unemployable. This is not the case in this country today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are winding back almost all universal benefits, all the minimum social standards. Things we saw as basic provisions of any advanced nation are disappearing: a free education through secondary school for all, a free tertiary education based on merit, a medical system that seeks to assure that no&hyphen;one is denied health simply through lack of money, and that health is a provision made by society and of benefit to everyone in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These social ideals seem to be going. We see a huge push to user pays. The corollary of that term is, `If you can't pay, you can't use,' which may sound fair until you realise it is being applied to primary and secondary education. A GST will make it worse: everyone must consume to survive. Clearly, everyone cannot get an income. The push for so&hyphen;called labour market reform is designed to assure fewer people get a decent income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, I cannot see how it is remotely ethical to cut back on revenue, to help out those with surplus cash. I do not agree with the social objective that seems to be pushed here. Some form of marriage is fine and a valid personal choice. It is a fulfilling one for some people. I do not believe that it is available to all people without economic hardship and I do not believe that this is a social objective that should be supported through the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this measure is also designed to support a move away from a universal pension and towards self&hyphen;funded income based retirement. There is no obligation here to create a superannuation fund for a non&hyphen;working spouse, so far. But given the general trend towards obligatory superannuation provision or other retirement savings, the push for making retirement savings unavailable until retirement age and the desire of government to shed social responsibilities I think is a move towards a two&hyphen;tiered retirement system. It is a particular worry in light of other moves to up the retirement age.</PARA>

I agree with Senator Margetts's observations about the direction in which the tax system is, in rhetoric, being pushed to support a particular kind of family, but in reality it is really heavily skewed towards higher income earners, because they are the only ones who will be able to find the amount that is going to be paid into the account on behalf of a spouse. Rather than say that we do not agree with the principle of providing an opportunity for this to happen at all, I agree with Labor's proposal which is to target it more fairly by using the same tests that the government used; in other words, to use the same means test as the family tax payments and the same assets test as is used in determining social security benefits.

In the majority of cases, I suspect, the spouses will be women who have had a break from full&hyphen;time work to raise their children. This measure is consistent with the objectives of the government's superannuation policy, because women make up the majority of older people in our society and often have limited access to superannuation. It is particularly designed to assist women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, we have to recognise that modern society is made up of great diversity. This is an attempt by the government to address what we see as a gap in the superannuation policy and to encourage provision for

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp mentioned that it is designed for low income spouses. I really do think that that deserves a response. Low income? We are talking about a society where the vast majority of people can barely afford what is being taken out of their salary for compulsory superannuation levies and other things that are required to be taken out. In many cases, they thought superannuation was about them being able to choose what to do with the money that they have taken out or sometimes volunteered to have taken out of their spendable income. They are finding that that will not be the case under the coalition government; that you are saying that more and more you will tell them what to do with that money, which will be to provide for their own income if they happen to become unemployed at 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about people who have taken a cut in pay, in reality, to provide for their own retirement. The vast majority of people can barely afford a cut in their own spendable income. In fact, it looks like, over time, it will replace the right to a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are saying that you are benefiting low income spouses but the reality is that you are providing a benefit for people who can afford to make not only a healthy superannuation contribution for themselves but a substantial contribution for their spouses. That is not low income. You might be talking about a person in a family who is not earning another income perhaps supplementing a substantial first income. That might be worth while looking at. But we are not talking about low income families here; we are talking about people who would like to minimise their tax. I object to the fact that you are pushing this as a low income benefit. It is not. It is something which people on middle range to upper range incomes will be able to access, not people on lower incomes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, Senator Kernot. The minister picks and chooses the promises that he seeks to justify, depending on the circumstances. It is not as though the government did not have the money, because the fascinating issue about the co&hyphen;contribution, which is a guaranteed payment into the superannuation of almost every Australian worker, is that it was funded in the forward estimates from last year's budget. The cost was delivered into a savings rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share Senator Margetts's concern about the theme of this government's approach. It was clearly enunciated in the budget papers, which used the term `universal incentive'. This measure is justified on the basis of a universal incentive for women, just as the savings rebate is justified on the basis of universal incentive. However, I make the point to the committee that universal incentive is not universal coverage. The reality of universal incentive is that those who have the money, who have the disposable income to take advantage of the incentive, are generally high&hyphen;income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence clearly demonstrates that this theme of moving away from universal coverage towards universal incentive will benefit higher income earners. It is not going to benefit lower income earners. If this measure passes, in whatever final form, it will be interesting to analyse just who benefits in terms of the income of the persons who pay the 18 per cent rebate on behalf of their spouses.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that I will be supporting schedule 10. I know that there have been and are an enormous number of anomalies in this area of superannuation which need to be addressed and need to be addressed urgently. In the area of superannuation for women, the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women in Super</EMPHASIS>  is very interesting. One of the submittees to the book says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exclusion of women who perform the unpaid work of our society is an issue that falls into the `too hard basket'. Diana Olsberg sees a great problem in the way in which women's work is valued. `Only certain women's work is valued in terms of the allocation of superannuation. Women caring for children, and increasingly, women out of the paid workforce to care for elderly and infirm relatives, are devalued. Somehow, ways must be found to recognise paid and unpaid work. It is this type of work which is unpaid at the time which denies future quality of life. Unpaid work should somehow or other attract paid superannuation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity for people who are not in paid employment to contribute to superannuation was raised during a number of the interviews and there was agreement that this along with many other `women's issues', would in the future be applicable to both men and women.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Do we have to wait until that time occurs? Many of us know people where the homemaker is actually the male, so let us just use the word `spouse'. In the situation where both major parties are promoting this idea of superannuation for retirement&mdash;there should be contributions to superannuation in order to ensure that persons live with some sort of dignity in their retirement which would also save money on pensions&mdash;why should certain women because they are doing unpaid work or certain men because they are doing unpaid work, which one sometimes feels is far more important than the type of work that we are doing and being paid for, be at a disadvantage when retirement age comes? That is a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I suppose the minister might say in relation to schedule 10, `Well, we are allowing for such contributions to be recognised for the purposes of taxation.' Okay, that is probably 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a start. I know there are vertical inequities in that, but at least let us have a look at the need for horizontal equity. The principle of horizontal equity asks why a family with dual income, on two incomes, should be at a greater advantage than a family on one income, when the spouse is employed in one of the most important jobs that a person could do in this nation&mdash;and that is the nurturing of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even at the level we are talking about in this particular legislation, why should we deny horizontal equity so far as superannuation is concerned in that particular area? That is why I am going to vote for schedule 10. Not because it is perfect; it is certainly not perfect. It is very imperfect when it comes to vertical superannuation equity for spouses, but at least it goes some of the way. I will be looking forward, as other colleagues have said, to other government initiatives which focus on the question of vertical tax equity as a result.</PARA></SPEECH>

We might be talking about groups of people whose income is such that they probably have a high percentage of nannies, housekeepers and gardeners, but we are not talking about paying unpaid work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take up a couple of the points that Senator Harradine has raised, because I have certainly thought about these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5605"> points deeply in the last few years when considering our attitude to superannuation. I accept, Senator Harradine, that in our supporting schedule 10 we are establishing horizontal equity in that, at least notionally and on paper, a low income spouse can receive a superannuation contribution. But, as you have indicated, you are sceptical about the vertical equity that will result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one sense, with this issue of how to take account of the homemaker's contribution&mdash;whether it is male or female&mdash;to `work' in a retirement incomes policy, the current age pension does that because it is a guaranteed minimum retirement income for a person who is not involved in the paid work force at all and who could never hope to accrue sufficient superannuation which is linked to the paid work force. So society does take that into account, at least to some extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How you can carry that principle further I am not sure. It is certainly an issue that I have thought about and that does perplex me, but it is a problem that all retirement income schemes right around the world have. All retirement income schemes are&mdash;at least to a significant extent&mdash;based on your time in the work force income, which is always a major problem with any system based on that concept. At least in Australia superannuation has that principle in part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical issue is to ensure that the funding of the basic pension is maintained at the level of 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That to me is one of the critical issues we have to face, given the era of at least lower taxes, in whatever form that is delivered. Also, Australia currently has 1.7 million people who are over the age of 65 and it is estimated that by about 2050 there will be six million people who are over the age of 65. As a proportion of the population, that is one in 10 rising to just over two in 10 and that is a very significant demographic change which has enormous implications for retirement incomes. But that is just a bit of reflecting or philosophising on our approach to this long&hyphen;term problem. I will conclude my remarks there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Our amendments 6 to 8 go to the question of vertical equity that Senator Harradine has touched on. I have to say that vertical equity is not a term I would use too often, but it flows on from his concern about horizontal equity. In supporting schedule 10, we have established the very clear principle of horizontal equity&mdash;to use Senator Harradine's terminology. We have already made comment that the reality is that the persons who have significant disposable income in which to make up to $3,000 a year of contributions are highly likely to be higher income earners. So that does not ensure vertical equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments will introduce an income and assets test on the contributing spouse's eligibility. In regard to the income test, to claim the rebate, the contributing spouse's income must be less than $65,000, plus $3,000 for each dependent child. This is the same as the eligibility requirement to claim part (b) of the family tax initiative assistance, which I am sure Senator Kemp is thoroughly across.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right&mdash;`consistency'. In regard to the assets test, the combined assets of a couple must not exceed $376,750. Again, this is the same assets test requirement as that used to determine family payment eligibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Kernot&mdash;`Consistency again'. This amount is indexed annually to the CPI. The first increase is to take place on 1 July 1998. Any assets to be disregarded in valuing a taxpayer's assets are to be made by reference to section 1118 of the Social Security Act, and this is the assets test that applies to determine the eligibility for family payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in our approach to this we are attempting to ensure some level of equity and fairness in the application of the spouse rebate. It would save the government some money. I do not know how much, because certainly the opposition&mdash;and apparent from the government&mdash;does not have very detailed data on this particular measure. So we would urge the Senate to ensure some level of vertical equity and fairness in respect of this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in the second reading debate, I support the ALP move to limit the opportunity to use this government measure simply as another tax loophole accessible by the rich, because it is a tax deduction ultimately dependent on high income. I support the move to include a means test applied to the taxpayer as well as their spouse. There is really little need to give tax breaks to rich people to provide for their spouses. They can, and do, provide adequately. If they do not, there is general legal recourse open to at least the married spouses of such rich people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have opposed this schedule, as honourable senators know. Given that I have been unsuccessful in eliminating it, I do seek to limit its ambit as a means for the well-off to rearrange family assets for the purpose of tax minimisation. A minimal means of doing this is to exclude the very rich from a scheme through an income and assets test. I will support the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting opposition amendments Nos 6 to 8 for a number of reasons. We think in these circumstances, given the nature of superannuation, a means test on the contributor would discriminate against the low income partner. This measure is an incentive to encourage superannuation support for low income spouses; that is the purpose of the measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the majority of cases, the low income spouses will be women. But, as Senator Harradine mentioned, there are increasing numbers of men who would see themselves remaining at home. The reality at present is that in the majority of cases the low income spouses will be women who have probably had to break from work to raise children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event of a family break, it is possible that the low income partner may be left with little or no superannuation. The major benefit in the form of superannuation support goes to the low income spouse and this spouse is appropriately means tested. In means testing the contributing spouse, you are penalising, in effect, the low income spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I understand from the tax advisers who are with us that asset testing is not a concept that is commonly used in tax law. To introduce asset testing would be complex in this case and expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I said, the government will not be supporting the measure. We do not support the proposition that somehow you can say, `You can rely on your husband's super,' or, `You can rely on your wife's super,' if the male is the low income spouse. We will not be supporting the amendments which have been proposed by Senator Sherry.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Income Tax Assessment Act, the bible of personal tax, defines `spouse' as anyone living in a marriage&hyphen;like relationship whether or not they are married. The tax act, like the Social Security Act, looks at realities in society most of the time rather than seeking to preserve the sanctity of marriage. It is a secular thing and recognises that the key element of concern in taxation is the economic relationship between people and the social bonds that create expectations of economic cooperation and mutual support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this sense, the tax act supports a fairly realistic reflection of society. It acknowledges that people live together with bonds of love, cooperation and mutual support whether or not they are legally married. Those bonds are no less real and no less material because they are not sanctified in a religious rite. This has been recognised by people in general for millennia. Living together predates marriage. The understanding of common law marriage has been applied in the past though it is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superseded here by the more defined definition of de facto marriage, a marriage in fact though not formalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax act recognises most such unions. It should really recognise all such unions. Unfortunately, it says a spouse is a person living with a taxpayer in a bona fide domestic relationship as husband or wife. Someone decided that a husband is a male, a wife female and that a person cannot live as a husband to a man or a wife to a woman and therefore interpreted a very broad definition to exclude same sex couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On what basis are they excluded? It is clear, even to the most homophobic in our society, that same sex couples really do live together in love and in relationships that are fundamentally no different from relationships of opposite sex couples in any social or economic way. Same sex partners make life plans, buy houses, raise children, support each other, look after each other when sick, buy furniture together and live lives as couples. They live together, some in bliss, some in strife, just like opposite sex couples. Like opposite sex couples, some are better at fidelity, some cheat and some make conscious choices to live more open sexual lives. The key phrase is `like opposite sex couples'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Diversity exists regardless of gender, just as love and bonding, romance and living as life partners exists regardless of gender. The key thing is that, economically, and in fundamental social terms, there is no point in discriminating between couples on the basis of gender. Such discrimination should not be in law. There is no discrimination that says couples have to be of the same religion, race, economic or educational background or blood type. Why gender?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to eliminate this discrimination from the law. I do not really think it was ever intended to be in the tax law given the fairly careful non-gendered language. `Taxpayer' is not a gender term. `Spouse' is not a gender term. `Bona fide domestic relationship' is not gendered. When I first read the definition of spouse, I for one could not see why same sex couples were not already included. It was explained to me that they were excluded due to the interpretation of the term `husband and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5610"> wife', an interpretation that does not allow for the cognitive leap that a woman may be the wife of a female partner. They may act as wives to each other and as husbands too, just as people say a single parent must be both mother and father to their child regardless of their gender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment would make a more inclusive definition clear. Spouse should include same sex relationships as well as de facto opposite sex relationships. It cannot currently include de jure relationships because we have made it illegal for same sex couples to marry. We have prevented these people from making those kinds of legal, spiritual bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is no unanimity on this issue, even in the gay and lesbian community. Some do not wish to be included as couples and fear that, if same sex couples are recognised, they will be so included against their will. Of course, not all opposite sex people in relationships wish to be considered couples and some are so considered in law against their will. I suggest that this is an issue to look into in terms of our treatment of all couples rather than an excuse to continue to discriminate against same sex couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The push for legal recognition of couple status allows people to be recognised. It does not force people to be couples or have the kind of relationships that include making life plans together. What legal recognition would do is begin to overturn the type of systematic discrimination that leads a same sex spouse to be disinherited on the event of a partner's death and a challenge by a family member of their spouse on the basis that they legally cannot be married or cannot be considered to have a de facto relationship and therefore cannot be considered a spouse with a spouse's right to joint property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in spite of the fact they may have lived openly together, bought property together, raised children together and been seen in  the  community  as  having  a  relationship in all ways equivalent to at least de facto marriage. They may even have been religiously married. All that is currently taken as having no legal standing and that is unjust and wrong.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A legal recognition of same sex relationships would begin to reverse this kind of discrimination where a spouse of 25 years, married religiously and clearly identified in the community as partners in a life relationship, cannot get to see their partner in a hospital after a car accident because they are `not related'. There are dozens of examples of places where discrimination is applied on a fairly systematic basis&mdash;the treatment of life insurance, superannuation and in various aspects of relations&mdash;because, legally, same sex partners cannot be considered even to have a de facto relationship in spite of the fact that even homophobes today generally recognise that such relationships do exist and in spite of specific cases where it is clear such relationships exist and the community accepts that the people concerned are in such a relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet nothing can be done because such relationships are legally defined out of existence. It would not take much to include these people with the inclusion of a specific phrase saying it applied to people regardless of respective gender. I do think it needs to be that specific, given the legal loading of terms like `husband', `wife' and `marriage'. I commend my amendment to the Senate. I do not think we can fail to support this amendment and still claim to support an internationally accepted notion of human rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This measure would further limit the availability of the tax rebate to the wealthy. I understand that the avowed intention of the measure is to provide for a dependent or partially dependent spouse on reaching retirement age. Since a spouse is generally provided for, whether or not they have personal superannuation when they reach retirement age, simply because they remain a spouse and continue living in a house and sharing everything with their partner, it really does not matter in whose name the superannuation resides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one exception. If a dependent spouse is separated from their working or formerly working partner, they may wish to have some independent source of income. Also, if the spouse of a dependent person denies or limits access to funds, that dependent person may want independent income. Otherwise, in most relationships a joint income may be fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a person with money denies or limits a spouse access to that money, it is possible 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5612"> in the case of separation or divorce for the spouse to take legal recourse to obtain a portion of the income and/or a share of the assets. It is also possible to take such measures in the case of a de facto marriage where there are children from the marriage. It is my understanding that such income is not as secure being tied to the dependency of the children. In other words, a married spouse will always have legal recourse to claim a share of income and assets of the marriage both within marriage and in the case of marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for a married spouse there seems little need for a measure to ensure that they have individual superannuation. The area where provision for an independent retirement income becomes important is in the case of a de facto spouse, particularly one without children or one whose children have reached or nearly reached the age of independence, which, under the Family Law Act, now seems significantly less than the assumption of independence under things like Austudy regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is legitimate about supporting women who are separated, I would say the vulnerable women are precisely those who are not married. While it is not certain that a married spouse will get half the assets in decisions under the Family Law Act, decisions which take all assets including a husband's superannuation into account, the precedent under family law is that in most cases a de jure spouse does get a significant portion of the assets and income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like bring up a concern raised with me by some women's groups. The normal practice, since superannuation assets cannot be split, in the event of a breakdown of marriage, is to award the superannuation assets to the husband and the house to the wife. It was raised as a potential downside of the government's scheme that provision by a spouse of superannuation assets for the woman may result in the sale of the house and the splitting of that asset. This would mean that the wife would lose the house and have less in liquid assets since they cannot access the superannuation their spouse contributed until they reach at least 55. I am not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain of what the outcome will be and I guess we will have to wait for the first court cases to see what it will be in the case of a ruling, but they have raised these issues with me and I express some concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They certainly do not want to say that the woman having superannuation is a bad thing, but they also do not want it to result in unintended penalties. I wonder whether the minister would be able to tell me what the ramifications are likely to be for distribution of property in the event of separation where a person has contributed to a married spouse's superannuation. I would also like to know what the general practice and precedents are in relation to distribution of property in a separation between de facto spouses, particularly where there are no children of the marriage, as that term is defined in the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this is a highly dubious measure for most people in Australia, and since it comes from a revenue base it comes at the expense of other, potentially far more beneficial, programs. That is why I took issue with Senator Harradine saying that if the government wants to be generous, then let them. They are generous at the expense of other groups who may well need the revenue measures far more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if it is to be provided as an incentive at the expense of revenue for the provision of support of dependant spouses in event of separation, as the government has argued, then I would think the measure should be targeted at those most at risk. These are the de facto spouses&mdash;not necessarily the married spouses of the people who are able to make those sorts of contributions. My amendment would ensure that this most vulnerable group is the one that is targeted and I commend this amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot, I think, has summed up one major reason for taking a different approach from the Greens. The issue of the splitting of superannuation in the event of the breakdown of a relationship is a very complex issue. I understand Senator Kemp might be able to inform us&mdash;the Attorney&hyphen;General, I think, is undertaking some sort of review of this issue generally at the present time. As I understand it, on the dissolution of a relationship, the Family Court does calculate the total assets&mdash;that is, house and superannuation of the couple&mdash;and split them down the middle. But the difficulty is that the Family Court cannot split the superannuation fund. The superannuation fund cannot be accessed; it cannot be split between the two parties legally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, I think, is correct when she says there are a number of effects. One, of course, is that one of the partners, and it will usually be a woman, if she is awarded the property, in order to obtain some income, sells the property. There are a range of social and economic problems associated with that. I might say often the person, and it is generally the male because of the background associated with superannuation, keeps the superannuation and, in fact, often takes out a loan to pay the balance&mdash;if there is a balance&mdash;to his ex&hyphen;partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very complex issue. It is an issue that does need a coordinated policy approach. For that reason, and the reason that Senator Kernot has raised, I do not think this is the correct way to deal with this matter. If think that if we are dealing with division of superannuation assets in respect to the ending of a relationship, Labor's approach would be that we should consider that issue in the context of family law, and we should consider all of

There are many reasons why couples in fact cannot make provision for their spouse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to once again draw the attention of the Senate to the situation facing some 500,000 Australian citizens in Canberra and the surrounding region. I am, of course, referring to the Australian capital region, as it is now collectively known, and the economic pressure being brought to bear as a direct result of the decisions by the federal government to cut jobs. It is well documented that over 20,000 jobs have been and will be cut from this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5619"> region. They are all from the same sector; it happens to be the public sector in this particular region. But we also know that job losses will flow through to the private sector as a result of these cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also well documented is how the federal government quite rightly rallied around the community of Newcastle when BHP made a specific decision that deprived that region of 2,500 jobs. In addition, the state government matched some of the support with a financial contribution in a bipartisan effort to cushion the impact on that particular community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That support was forthcoming in the following ways: $10 million was put in in cooperation between the federal government and the New South Wales state government. That money will be used to generate longer term economic and employment opportunities in the region. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) also announced that there would be a $2 million jobs package, including $1.2 million for the creation of new small businesses. In his press release the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently, we have allocated $1.9 million for 174 extra training places under the special employer support program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My point this evening is to draw the parallels between Newcastle and the Australian Capital Region. My point is not only has there been no support forthcoming but there also has been a barrage of criticism from Liberal quarters about Canberra. Canberra bashing has now reached new heights with the coalition government. They have launched a two-pronged defensive which can be described in the following ways: one angle is this deafening silence on any support package to assist our community in establishing alternative industries and hence future employment sources; the other angle is the active Canberra bashing campaign that Minister Fahey gave renewed prominence to during the parliamentary recess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this lack of support and active denigration of Canberra is perhaps most succinctly demonstrated by the Prime Minister's refusal to reside here. I am, of course, referring to his decision to choose Kirribilli as his place of residence. This symbolic rejection of Canberra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has become quite a feature of John Howard's general political agenda to deconstruct the direct government administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting aside for a moment the politics of public sector cuts generally, I believe that, if it were not for a patently anti-Canberra campaign, this government would have been obligated to provide a support package to assist this region's economy through a very difficult transition period. This package, if you applied, to a degree, proportionality with the support package that was afforded to the Newcastle community, would be quite substantial. If you were to apply direct proportionality between the anticipated job losses here in the ACT and the joint support package offered by the New South Wales and federal governments, you would be looking at a support package totalling some $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those other support areas that I mentioned before&mdash;a jobs package and special employer support programs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bit of targeted support where it is needed most, where the jobs are going and where they are going to come from in the future, needs to be specifically addressed. This package, however, is not forthcoming. We have seen no indication from the federal government that they are in the least bit sensitive to the ACT's spiralling bankruptcy rates and to the marginalisation of local businesses through the outsourcing of government services to large multinational corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen no response to the downward pressure on property values that are undermining the principal asset of the vast majority of ACT residents&mdash;their houses. There is also no response to plummeting business confidence, outside the sector that is capitalising on the advice that the government is procuring on outsourcing and contract management. You would think this government would have got the message when local Liberal Party members, who are also small business owners, start resigning from their party in disgust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are, however, a couple of opportunities for the federal government to try to hang on to the last remnant of credibility&mdash;I do not think they have any credibility left in the local community but, if they did, there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5620"> some things that they could specifically do. They could review the current employment situation and the pending employment situation in Canberra as a result of these cuts. They could acknowledge what is happening in the regional economy because not only are their cuts taking away up to 20,000-odd jobs over the next few years but they are also having a significant impact upon the potential growth of the private sector and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government could come up with a package that involved some direct support to promoting the growth of business in the ACT; they could come up with a package that funded some job and retraining programs; and they could come up with a package that saw the ACT government join with the federal government in providing some quite specific grant assistance to local companies who are struggling under the pressure. There is a need to focus on industry diversification in the ACT. Both local business and local government have known that for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Prime Minister could also renounce what is quite a shallow, vitriolic vendetta against Canberra and take away the perception, which exists very strongly, that he has no time for this place. But I do not think anyone should hold their breath. In my view, there have been two remarkable features of John Howard's leadership to date. The first is his indulgence in pursuing his pet hates&mdash;unions, the ABC, Canberra, multiculturalism and the public sector generally. The other feature, of course, is the Prime Minister's willingness to use his family as justification for his personal intervention or activity in a given policy area. His move to Sydney is far more symbolic of taking away the symbolism of Canberra as the national capital than anything else that he has done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment tonight on the case of Mr Konrad Kalejs, an Australian citizen accused of involvement in horrific war crimes in Nazi controlled Latvia during World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How Mr Kalejs became an Australian citizen may well warrant further examination. He attained citizenship in 1957, during a nine&hyphen;year stay in Australia. He was deported from the United States back to Australia three years ago following a nine&hyphen;year battle against the United States Justice Department, which claimed that he had lied about his wartime activities on his entry papers when he said he was a farm labourer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1995, he fled to Canada following the release of secret US files about his alleged wartime activities. Canadian authorities found that he was a member of a notorious Latvian death squad during World War II and that he was allegedly responsible for the deaths of at least 30,000 Jews. A 10&hyphen;month inquiry found that he had helped to run a slave labour camp in Nazi occupied Latvia, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5621"> where prisoners were starved, tortured and killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States and Canadian investigations based some of their findings on an investigation carried out by the now defunct Australian Special Investigation Unit which had, apparently, insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution. The Special Investigation Unit was disbanded in 1992, following three unsuccessful prosecutions of alleged war criminals. It was initially set up by the federal government in 1987, and it investigated 841 people suspected of being directly involved in the murder of millions of Jews during World War II. It was later revealed that $22.5 million was spent investigating these cases, with a further $5 million spent on legal aid in the defence of three accused men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current citizenship act, Mr Kalejs is immune from deportation from Australia. Earlier this year, the government amended the citizenship act and revoked the 10-year limitation on actions. This means that, no matter how much time has elapsed, anyone found to have fraudulently obtained citizenship could be deported. However, the amendment is not retrospective and, therefore, will have no effect on people who obtained citizenship prior to the amendment taking effect. Whether there is, in extreme cases, an argument that the legislation should have retrospective effect that would enable citizenship to be revoked if in the national interest is beside the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compelling issue is: what can Australia realistically achieve in this perplexing matter? Firstly, there can be no argument that there is a moral imperative to pursue alleged war criminals&mdash;no matter how old the atrocities and no matter how feeble the accused. The probability that Mr Kalejs was the perpetrator of unimaginable crimes seems overwhelming. How could we ignore the call for justice by those survivors and relatives of those dispatched so callously by the Nazi machine? How could we seemingly condone his actions by failing to take every available form of recourse?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are obvious limits to investigating the allegations of war crimes against Mr Kalejs through the Australian judicial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system. The Attorney-General, Mr Williams, has asked his department to contact Canadian authorities to obtain materials used in the decision to deport Mr Kalejs. These materials will be examined by the Australian Federal Police and, if appropriate, the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get to court, the Director of Public Prosecutions must make an assessment about the prospects of successfully obtaining a conviction and also determine whether or not court proceedings are in the public interest. It is the same standard that must be applied to the case of Mr Kalejs as to other criminal matters. There are obvious problems with this approach. The age of the defendant, insufficient witnesses and establishing the authenticity of documentation mean that securing a guilty verdict is very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other nations such as the United States rely heavily on the use of revocation of citizenship and deportation as a method of dealing with proven war criminals. Even if deprivation of citizenship and deportation were more readily available in Australia, there are frequently unforeseen difficulties in the path of stripping someone of citizenship if it renders them, in turn, stateless or a refugee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the Latvian government indicated that it would seek the extradition of Mr Kalejs but that his Australian citizenship may prove an obstacle in prosecuting him in Latvia as, obviously, he is not a Latvian citizen. When Latvia gained independence from Moscow in 1991, it established war crimes legislation in line with international conventions with no statute of limitation on prosecutions. However, it would be futile to believe that, even if it were available, a prosecution of Mr Kalejs in Latvia would be less difficult than in Australia. Moreover, for survivors and the victims' families, a failed prosecution may well prove as much a travesty of justice as no trial at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Kalejs case teaches us is that dealing effectively with war crimes is as much about dealing with the future as it is about dealing with the past. The war atrocities committed in Rwanda, Bosnia, Cambodia and the Gulf War provide graphic examples of contemporary genocide.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5622">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for justice and to redress the wrongs of these conflicts has again brought to the fore the possibility of international cooperation and responsibility in the coordination of information and detection of suspected war criminals. The establishment of a permanent international criminal court to try those accused of crimes against humanity would provide international recognition of the enormity of the problem where it is beyond the resources of one nation to solve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May 1993, the Security Council of the United Nations determined that the situation in the former Yugoslavia constituted a threat to international peace and security and so established the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the ICTFY, as an enforcement measure under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The establishment of the tribunal and its twin, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the ICTR, represents significant and groundbreaking steps by the international community to enforce international humanitarian and international criminal law through criminal prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials following the end of World War II have there been international prosecutions for violations of international humanitarian law. The ICTFY is the first international body in almost 50 years to prosecute war crimes and related international crimes. These two tribunals also set important precedents regarding the rules of procedure and evidence to apply in international criminal proceedings. The International Law Commission has been in the process of drafting a Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind and a statute for a proposed permanent International Criminal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If and when the international community deems it appropriate to establish a permanent international criminal court with jurisdiction over a wide range of international crimes, these tribunals will provide a rich body of law and useful precedents on a multitude of aspects of this important part of international law. In the meantime, the tribunals espouse the message that those who commit crimes that threaten international peace and security 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be brought to justice, and provide an important vehicle for the victims of these two tragic conflicts to express the horrors of the wars they endured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of a permanent international war tribunal will no doubt be too late to deal with Mr Kalejs and will no doubt be too late for the victims of the Holocaust. Even if Mr Kalejs is brought to trial, there is little basis to believe that he would be tried and convicted in a time frame that would deliver any meaningful outcome. Perhaps the best Australia can hope to achieve from past experiences in prosecuting war criminals, is the vigorous pursuit of justice for more recent victims in an international forum.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5622"><TITLE>Kimberley Region</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to talk tonight on the Kimberley and the damming of the Fitzroy River. The Australian Democrats unequivocally reject the way in which economic growth is calculated. We totally reject the notion that economic growth must be pursued at any cost. We reject the idea that economic growth is a good in itself and that it must be maximised in the short term at every opportunity. Economic growth is good when it delivers significant net benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reject the notion that sacrifices must be made&mdash;environmental sacrifices, cultural sacrifices, social sacrifices or long-term economic sacrifices. We support the view that any development must be appraised on a full cost&hyphen;benefit basis and that long-term net benefit is required to make a project acceptable. It is no good always telling us what the benefits are. Honest governments should also tell us what the costs are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the planned resource development projects now being proposed for the Kimberley region in Western Australia, the sacrifices will be in all of those categories. The environmental, social, cultural and long-term economic wellbeing of the region is at risk. No appraisal has been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the push to pursue economic growth at any cost, we are seeing renewed pressure on our remaining remote and relatively unspoilt areas. There is a relentless push by a few to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5623"> maximise the exploitation of natural resources and to extract wealth quickly from environments which are seen as exploitable and vulnerable to selfish interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Fitzroy River, there is fierce and united opposition to plans for a massive new irrigated cotton/ horticultural industry, supported by the damming of the Fitzroy River. Aboriginal communities, the tourism industry, the pearling and fishing industries, and many pastoralists all are saying no to the proposal, but the vested interests of a few may well jeopardise the very future of those people and their industries. If the Kimberley region is the next to suffer from short-term economic exploitation, it will not only be just the many local residents and local businesses who will suffer; it will be at the expense of all Australians and future generations in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regions like the Kimberley are rare on planet Earth at the end of the 20th century&mdash;a wide landscape which, although substantially altered by Western civilisation and agrarian and mining industries, still retains a strong character of remoteness, freshness and naturalness and one which is much valued by those Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups, and individuals, who enjoy it. Its natural values&mdash;its myriad of landscapes, spectacular wetlands and escarpments, its coastline and its stunning, wild Fitzroy River&mdash;make the Kimberley a national treasure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The region has many internationally significant environments, including Ramsar&hyphen;listed wetlands and remnant rainforests. Other places, like the Purnululu National Park and the majestic wilderness coastline, have been spoken of as possible world heritage areas. The North Kimberley is believed to be the only part of Western Australia which has so far suffered no extinctions of native fauna species. In a state and country which have lost so many species since colonisation, this is a record that must be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of the natural features of this area, from the spectacular gorges to the unique species that frequent the open plains, cannot be measured in just dollars. They have an intrinsic value. They are valuable for their own sake. We do not need to exploit them to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase their value. But even when you talk in dollars, our state does not put their value, intangible and tangible, on the state's balance sheet; it is just a blank space marked `for exploitation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some, such as tourist operators and those involved in the fishing industry, the areas have a high economic value as they are. They do not need to be developed to enable people to make a living. Indeed, we risk putting in jeopardy the livelihoods of many if we dedicate these resources to the cotton industry. The understanding and appreciation of these unique areas of the Kimberley, and in particular the Fitzroy River, is becoming widespread&mdash;both nationally and internationally. Yet despite all this, we probably are at great risk of losing the unique values over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a state government and, it seems from the answer to my question in the Senate today, possibly also a federal government, prepared to facilitate the building of a dam and the development of huge cotton production through irrigation. If this scheme were objectively and scientifically appraised, we doubt that such economic land use would be found to be appropriate or sustainable in the long term. And that is without talking about the environment and cultural and land factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the initial rush to open up pastoral and mining activities in the late 19th century, the character of the Kimberley changed gradually over the first half of this century. These pastoral activities have caused widespread changes to ecosystems and, in many cases, significant environmental damage to what are often fragile lands. In some areas, such as those affected by the Ord River Valley, the impact has been devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the long-term impact on the environment, major social and cultural changes have occurred as Aboriginal people have been dispossessed. By the 1960s big engineering projects began to be seriously contemplated and in some cases, such as the damming of the Ord, the projects went ahead without any adequate assessment of the impact on the environment&mdash;to this day&mdash;and no assessment of the social or cultural impact on the local people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5624">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in the 1980s, 100 years after the first concerted colonial move into the region, that a renewed push to intensify the exploitation of the so-called `last western frontier' really began to bite. The 1980s commenced under the dark cloud surrounding the infamous Noonkanbah confrontation between mining interests and the state government on one side and the Aboriginal people, seeking respect for their rights to their land and culture, on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in the decade, the Argyle diamond mine was opened to state, national and global fanfare. Mineral exploration programs all across the Kimberley and in the adjacent marine environment have continued relentlessly to this day. At the same time, tourism levels began to increase rapidly and Broome became the focus of international interest rising on the back of Lord McAlpine's controversial patronage. Proposals for tourism developments&mdash;ranging from international airports to remote wilderness resorts&mdash;began to emerge, and to some extent those developments did begin to multiply across the landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the operation of the pastoral industry have accelerated, with a shift away from traditional grazing towards more intensive methods of exploiting the land. Pastoralists have also become increasingly involved in tourism ventures on their leases, raising important questions about leasehold legalities. Now, as we stand on the edge of the millennium, the momentum for major industrial development in the Kimberley has reached very disturbing levels.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5624"><TITLE>Privacy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Privacy protection in Australia needs to extend to the collection, storage, security, access, correction, use, destruction and disclosure of all personal information. The present legislative scheme set out in the Privacy Act 1988 addresses the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information held by the Commonwealth government. This scheme also extends to credit reporting and some telecommunications suppliers and operators. But this scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not otherwise extend to the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 September 1996 a discussion paper was released by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) which set out a scheme based on the existing information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988 and added to this codes of practice and a range of additional provisions which addressed the particular concerns of the private sector. In essence this was a proposal for industry codes of practice supervised by the Privacy Commissioner and subject to statutory backing&mdash;a co&hyphen;regulatory approach. This scheme is consistent with the schemes adopted by Hong Kong, New Zealand and the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on 21 March this year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced that the Privacy Act 1988 would not be extended to the private sector. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth opposes such proposals which will further increase compliance costs for all Australian businesses, large and small.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was it&mdash;the end of Australia's international best practice privacy scheme and another election promise broken. The reasons for this decision and the relevant information the Prime Minister relied on in making this decision have not yet been made available. A decision of this importance cannot be passed off without some explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's `backflip' is also at odds with the major industrialised countries which have recognised the economic and social benefits of privacy protection. The ministerial meeting of G7 industrialised countries in February 1995 and APEC ministers in May 1995 identified privacy as an issue which was important for commercial reasons. The European Union has adopted a legally enforceable law in the form of the Privacy Directive, which can prevent the flow of data. New Zealand has its own Privacy Act, which creates a comprehensive national privacy scheme applying to both the public and the private sectors. So failure by this government to introduce privacy legislation for the private sector is likely to threaten future interactions between our nations. This is serious and should be reviewed and is particularly import 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5625"> ant to the telecommunications and information technology industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that a number of state and territory governments are presently examining privacy legislation options. If state and territory governments do introduce privacy schemes, businesses will be required to satisfy those requirements which may be different for each state and territory, therefore increasing overall compliance costs and the regulatory burdens&mdash;apparently the very thing that our Prime Minister sought to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fragmented approach to privacy protection is likely to increase compliance costs and the regulatory burden for many businesses. This approach has been adopted in Canada, where there is a centralised scheme for public agencies and a hotchpotch of province laws with varying requirements. This is not what Australian consumers or businesses need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fundamental principle that a person has a right to know what personal information is held about them and, if the information is lawfully held, that the information is correct. The International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights identify privacy in terms of their specific concerns. Privacy is a human rights issue and the government should deal with this issue appropriately by introducing suitable legislation on a national basis which complies with Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have long supported a strong and enforceable privacy scheme which goes to assuring consumers that their personal information is adequately protected. This is reinforced by the concerns that businesses are likely to be affected detrimentally and excluded from data flows through inadequate regulation. We must have some direction from the government to satisfy consumers and business interests and avoid the possibility of an array of state and territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked, and my party has asked, the government to reconsider its decision on a variety of occasions, and we have asked that they consult a little more widely. Unfortunately, it seems they are relying on the interests of a few to the exclusion of an international 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> best practice privacy scheme and the potential to develop and lead the information businesses of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have therefore brought before the Senate an exposure draft document which addresses some of the concerns. I propose to seek leave to table this document tonight together with an explanatory exposure draft document which outlines my suggested amendments and the rationale behind them. I also consider privacy legislation to be quite a complex matter which would benefit from the cross&hyphen;party analysis and scrutiny that goes with the Senate committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exposure draft, which I have brought before the Senate this evening, implements a scheme where industry is either covered by legislated privacy principles or develops its own codes of practice with the cooperation of the Privacy Commissioner and subject to approval by the parliament. The privacy principles and codes of practice maintain comprehensive and enforceable privacy protection with powers conferred on the Privacy Commissioner which are similar to those currently set out in the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `agency' would be extended to include all persons, including unincorporated bodies, who would be covered by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in particular article 17 of that covenant dealing with corporations and trading corporations and financial corporations. However, acts or practices which are done for personal or family reasons, household affairs or journalistic, literary or artistic purposes would not be covered. Other amendments could be suggested which are directed at including codes of practice in the operation of the act in its present structure and application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New information privacy principles are added which cover areas of justifiable purpose, limiting the retention of information, maintaining anonymity and unique identifiers. In the absence of codes of practice, these principles will apply to all agencies. Where an identified grouping generally, a specified person, a specified class of person, a specified agency, industry, profession, calling or specif 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5626"> ic act or practice has been identified by either the Privacy Commissioner or at the request of that class, the Privacy Commissioner may issue codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this code of practice is issued there must be reasonable efforts to inform affected classes and accept their submissions. The code of practice comes into practice following a resolution passed, say, by both houses of the parliament. A code of practice may override the operation of the information privacy principles or specify how that principle is to apply to that industry, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exposure draft would also expand the functions of the Privacy Commissioner to enable the commissioner to make public statements about privacy. This additional function the Democrats consider would be an appropriate addition as it would allow the Privacy Commissioner to undertake community education campaigns on privacy issues and prepare materials that relate to public interest matters. The Privacy Commissioner will also be able to promote the protection of individual privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, and certainly the Democrats believe this strongly, that consumers and large and small businesses alike deserve some kind of standard, some uniform national laws, when it comes to privacy in the private sector. I am glad of this opportunity to bring this exposure draft before the Senate tonight. I seek the leave of the Senate to table the exposure draft document along with the exposure draft explanatory document.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There were sixteen letters received prior to 28 June 1996 from Federal and State members of parliament in relation to the closure of CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these letters related to the Manly CES office, which had been earmarked as a potential site for rationalisation and relocation with the Department of Social Security into a "one&hyphen;stop&hyphen;shop" at Brookvale, by the previous Government in late 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 15 letters were received from 11 individual Federal members and two State members of parliament and concerned 11 CES offices, three of which were subsequently closed. In total, of the 26 offices closed, 18 were located in Coalition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seats and 8 were located in seats held by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No decision was made to not close a CES office as a result of representations from a member of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) All Coalition Members of Parliament in whose electorate a CES office was to close was advised informally by members of the Minister's Office and Departmental officers on Friday 28 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary of the Department also wrote to all Members of Parliament in whose electorate a CES office was to be closed. This advice was faxed to the members' electorate offices on 28 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister also personally contacted a number of Labor MPs whose electorates were affected by the closure of an office on 28 June and during the following weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The decision to close CES offices was taken on 28 June 1996. The first office was closed on 26 July 1996 and the other offices involved were closed before the end of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The rationale for these CES offices to be closed was based on providing the most effective client service delivery network within the resources available. These closures followed careful case by case consideration, taking into account the loss of staff through voluntary redundancies and the need for the Department to live within its financial means. Other factors taken into account included impending office lease expiry dates, existing accommodation which had concerns in terms of occupational health and safety for both staff and clients, client service demand levels, the relative ease for clients to travel to another office to obtain services including proximity to public transport, and alternative and more cost&hyphen;effective means of providing services including the use of enhanced technology such as touchscreens.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The OECD's "Education At A Glance" (EAG) contains a number of tables providing information on expenditure on educational services per student. Country data are compared using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), whose main categories do not exactly match institutional sectors for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Table F3.2 provides data on expenditure per student relative to per capita GDP. According to this table Australian expenditure per student at primary level in 1993 was 17.2 per cent of per capita GDP compared with 18.3 per cent for the total OECD. Australia ranked 14th of the 23 OECD countries for which data were available. For secondary education, expenditure per student was 28.1 per cent of per capita GDP compared with the OECD total of 25.8 per cent and we ranked 9th of the 24 OECD countries for which data were available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above data for secondary education include some of the Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. OECD Secondary Education 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> data comprise ISCED 2 (Lower Secondary) and ISCED 3 (Upper Secondary). It should be noted that the VET sector in Australia does not easily fit into the ISCED classification system used by the OECD, and award TAFE courses are allocated to Secondary Education (mainly ISCED 3) or to non-University Tertiary (ISCED 5). Owing to lack of data figures for private VET providers are not included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the OECD educational indicator data cited, the OECD's "Education At A Glance" publication presents data for 27 member countries and 3 non-member countries. Owing to missing data for some countries international coverage is incomplete for many indicators. The data need to be interpreted very carefully since there are a range of factors affecting comparability, including differences between countries in education systems, statistical methodology, data availability and classification practices. Financial statistics are further affected by differences between countries in accounting practices and in the way countries disaggregate costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure on education data across countries are highly sensitive to classification practices. Significant issues affecting comparisons include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In many cases countries do not collect all the data requested by the OECD or have difficulty in providing data that fully accord with OECD definitions. Household spending on education, and expenditure by private firms on the workplace component of apprenticeship training are commonly undercounted (to varying degrees).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Comparisons on a per student basis are impaired by problems in quantifying fulltime equivalent enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Countries differ in how pension costs are treated (in accounting for the cost of teaching and other staff) and this impacts on cost and expenditure comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The OECD does not publish data on the level of public funding for private schools in member countries. It is, however, possible to rank Australia in this regard using unpublished OECD financial data for 1993 taken from the OECD's internet site, which is located at http://www.oecd.org/els/stats/els stat.htm..</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia ranks as the country with the third highest level of Government Direct Expenditure on Private Institutions relative to Gross Domestic Product for ISCEDs 1, 2, and 3 combined (ie Primary and Secondary education). It should be noted that these data have been compiled using OECD definitions as to what constitutes a private educational institution and what levels of education are included in "school" education. The Australian figure was 0.54 per cent of GDP, which is relative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5633"> ly small compared with overall spending on education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The 1996 edition of the OECD Revenue Statistics publication indicates that Australia's tax revenue to GDP ratio for 1994 was 29.9 per cent. Australia thus ranked 24th Of the 28 countries listed. Countries with a lower tax to GDP ratio than Australia for 1994 were Mexico (18.8 per cent), Turkey (22.2 per cent), the United States (27.6 per cent) and Japan (27.8 per cent). The OECD average (unweighted) tax to GDP ratio for 1994 was 38.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory contributions made under Australia's Superannuation Guarantee arrangements are not treated as taxes by the OECD on the basis that the OECD defines taxes as compulsory, unrequited payments to general government. Compulsory superannuation contributions are not paid to general government and are not considered to be unrequited, as they are linked to either a specific amount being invested on behalf of an employee, or a negotiated arrangement (between employers and employees) for the provision of benefits based on salary levels and length of service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Federal Office of Road Safety obtained advice from the Department's legal staff on the legality of fitting bullbars, following a statement by a Melbourne Coroner regarding clause 42.9.1.1 of Australian Design Rule 42. The legal advice provided was that the Rule needed to be read in the context of what was technically essential to the operation of a vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Engineering staff in the Federal Office of Road Safety were asked to offer their opinions as to whether they considered a bullbar to be technically essential to the operation of a vehicle. An engineering opinion offered at the time was that bullbars were not technically essential since the vehicle could operate without them. Another view, as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indicated in the reply to question on notice no. 92, was that bullbars could be considered technically essential when operating in areas where there was a risk of collisions with wild animals or stray livestock, in that they could mean the difference between the vehicle being disabled or not. It is possible that a bullbar could prevent an animal from entering the passenger compartment through the windscreen and causing injury to the occupants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of whether or not a bullbar is technically essential hinges on consideration of the environment in which the vehicle operates; country drivers argue strongly that a bullbar is essential for rural operations. Many vehicles are used in both city and country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) The Australian Design Rules apply to vehicles before they are first supplied to the market for use in transport in Australia, while State and Territory authorities have powers to control the in&hyphen;service fitment of bullbars. The States and Territories are not obliged to incorporate the provisions of the Australian Design Rules into their legislation. However, as stated in the reply to question on notice no. 92, the States and Territories generally require on&hyphen;going compliance with the Australian Design Rules which applied at the time the vehicle was manufactured. (b) The State and Territory authorities (except in Victoria) have advised the Federal Office of Road Safety that they have no legislation of the kind that applies in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The State and Territory authorities have advised that the police accident report forms do not have any prompts which encourage reporting of the presence of bullbars. However, in the case of fatal accidents, information on the vehicle involved is usually quite detailed and information on the presence of bullbars can generally be obtained.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and the National Strategy for Equity in Schooling (NSES) are different in nature and purpose. The National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, agreed by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) in March 1997, is a plan for action towards achieving agreed National Literacy and Numeracy Goals. The NSES is a framework to address educational disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There has been considerable progress since the implementation of the NSES and a number of States continue to provide and promote a range of programs relating to the equity groups identified by Strategy. The NSES goals have been adopted, examined and progressed through professional development activities in systems and school 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5638"> communities and established in the planning and documentation by which schools are guided. For example, reports from Western Australia indicate that access and participation for all equity groups have continued to improve as a result of the wider application of technology, revised program delivery strategies and the development of management information strategies. In New South Wales, the Board of Studies has adopted a set equity principles (Statement of Values) that acts as a guide to all curriculum development activities. The Statement aims to ensure that curriculum and assessment activities develop fully the talents of all students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) As part of their commitment to the NSES, school authorities have agreed to participate in annual reporting and monitoring of agreed performance measures which are consistent within the framework developed for the National Report on Schooling in Australia (known as the ANR). In 1998 provision has been made for the MCEETYA to conduct a mid&hyphen;term review of the overall strategy, using available data. This will be repeated in 2001. The annual reporting and monitoring will provide the data to enable informed decisions to be made concerning the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Given the different nature and purpose of the National Strategy for Equity in Schooling and the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, as outlined in response to question (3), it is not intended to coordinate them to produce a comprehensive national set of aims and strategies. The Plan and the Strategy are best viewed as being complementary.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to the announcement in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget that the method of assessing a child's eligibility for the Child Disability Allowance (CDA) would be reformed and that those reforms would see a move away from assessing a child's eligibility for the CDA by deciding whether or not that child requires `substantially more care and attention' than other children of a similar age, to the introduction of a set of child disability tables against which the level of a child's disability can be measured: Given that the Government has said that the introduction of these tables will result in the CDA being much better targeted and that this better targeting will result in approximately 4 000 fewer new grants of CDA each year:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The draft child disability tables were field&hyphen;tested from September 1996 to February 1997 with new claimants for CDA. The figure of 4,000 is an estimate based on the field test results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The child disability tables are two questionnaires&mdash;one to the parent and one to a treating health professional&mdash;which cover a range of age related functional abilities and behavioural, emotional and special care needs associated with childhood disability. The results of field testing indicated that the questionnaires are a valid means of obtaining an objective indication of a child's level of disability. Analysis of the field testing data included a comparison of the outcome of a customers application for CDA with the score achieved for their child under the questionnaire assessment. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Field testing has also indicated that a significant proportion of claimants who are granted under the current rules are claiming for children whose disability or medical condition has little or no impact on their level of functioning. This data is also confirmed by a 1993 survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which indicated approximately 21% of children attracting CDA had no handicap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The field test indicated a small proportion of customers will qualify under the new assessment tool who may not have qualified under the current assessment process. This appears to be related to the subjective nature of the current assessment and the difficulty some claimants have in articulating how they provide "substantially more care and attention" for their child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The development of the new assessment method for CDA has taken place over several years with significant community input. The concept of using child disability tables was first raised by the Department of Social Security in `Child Disability Allowance&mdash;Policy Discussion Paper No.3, October 1993' which was distributed to more than 1200 community organisations. Overwhelmingly, responding community organisations were in favour of developing a simpler and more objective assessment tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the recent work on further developing and refining the questionnaires, three reference groups were formed. The reference groups were made up of representatives from consumer groups, treating health professionals and staff involved in administering CDA. The community (or consumer) reference group included nominees from organisations such as: the Carer's Association of Australia; the National Association for Autism; the National Council on Intellectual Disability; the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition; the National Federation of Blind Citizens; and the National Ethnic Disability Alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is conducting further community consultations by releasing a paper on the new assessment tool to more than 250 community organisations and seeking written submissions in response.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have been advised that the general design of the Telstra research study was based on a similar study that had been previously planned to determine whether 50 Hz powerline fields influence cancer rates in transgenic mice. Telstra saw a unique opportunity to conduct a parallel experiment alongside the original proposed study that would replace the 50 Hz fields exposure with digital mobile phone radiowaves. Both experiments were performed under the auspices of the Royal Adelaide Hospital which devolved the responsibility for the design, conduct, analysis and publication of the two studies to an independent Steering Committee chaired by professor Tony Basten from the Centenary Institute of Cancer Medicine &amp; Cell Biology in Sydney. This Committee had sole responsibility for publishing the results of the digital mobile phone study in the recent issue of Radiation Research (May 1997). A copy of the paper was provided to Telstra after it had been accepted for publication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The objective of the study as stated in the abstract of the journal paper reporting the experiment was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The aim of the present study was to determine whether long&hyphen;term exposure to pulse&hyphen;modulated RF fields similar to those used in digital mobile telecommunications would increase the incidence of lymphoma in Eu&hyphen;Pim1 transgenic mice, which are moderately predisposed to develop lymphoma spontaneously".  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I am advised that transgenic mice of the type used in this research carry an extra gene which makes them unusually prone to developing cancer of the immune system (lymphoma) following long term exposure to known carcinogens. These mice are therefore a highly sensitive model for testing the very subtle effects, if any, of agents like electromagnetic fields. Such a model was considered to be a valuable tool given the fact that over thirty years of research into electromagnetic fields has failed to provide conclusive evidence of any carcinogenic effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) &amp; (b) The researchers have recommended that there be independent confirmation of the results and to test the effects of varying exposure doses. A well designed proposal could, if submitted, be considered for inclusion in the NHMRC managed Australian EME Research program. Given the international interest generated and the scale of resources that may be required for confirmation studies there may be scope for international cooperation on the follow&hyphen;up studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Australian standard AS2772.1 was developed through a consultative process by Standards Australia, an independent, non&hyphen;Government organisation. Any questions about the standards development process should be addressed to Standards Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, however, difficult to see the study on its own affecting current standards, particularly in the absence of confirmation and establishment of any dose/response relationship. In addition, the researchers themselves, in reporting the work, qualified the results and specifically indicated that they should not be extended to the human exposure case. This study would also need to be considered in the context of other published or continuing research in this area.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of the impact of s.16 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987</EMPHASIS>  has been raised with me in the context of a suggestion that the Senate might, possibly through a Privileges Committee inquiry, undertake its own investigation of allegations concerning Senator Colston. I understand the Director of Public Prosecutions has raised concerns about the impact of s.16, if a Senate inquiry is held, for the presentation of evidence in any criminal case that might result from the present criminal investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Section 16 was enacted following concern at the narrow interpretation of the scope of parliamentary privilege in relation to the use of evidence in criminal trials given by two judges of the NSW Supreme Court in relation to the prosecution of Justice Murphy (see Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, 7th ed. pp.3&hyphen;5). The Murphy trial followed extensive separate Senate inquiries at which much evidence critical to the subsequent trial had been produced, and evidence had been received at those inquiries from key witnesses subsequently called during the trial. The narrow interpretation given to the then applicable parliamentary privilege (derived from Article 9 of the 1688 Bill of Rights) enabled much evidence and cross&hyphen;examination to occur that would not have been possible on a wider view of the extent of the privilege.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As to the first, S.16 does not prevent the admission in evidence in a court of a document tabled in Parliament or submitted to a Senate committee as evidence, unless it was evidence taken in camera (s.16(4)(a)). Thus, documents made public and published with appropriate Parliamentary authority are not prohibited from being admitted in a court, but there are significant limitations on the use that can be made of those documents, as I will outline below. Oral testimony before a committee given in camera can be produced only if the House or committee authorises the publication (s.16(4)(b)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other and potentially more significant limitation imposed by s.16 is the use that can be made in court of any evidence or documents given to the House or committee that is lawfully before the court. Subsection 16(3) significantly limits the ability to question a person about the veracity of anything forming part of parliamentary proceedings, and from questioning the credibility, motive, intention or good faith fo a person, or drawing inferences or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of those proceedings in Parliament. The effect of subsection 16(3) read with the broad definition of "proceedings in Parliament" in subsection 16(2) is to severely restrict the ability of a court to test evidence or undertake cross&hyphen;examination of a witness in relation to matters forming part of proceedings in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thus, I understand that statements presented to the Senate on 24 March 1997 made by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith, having been authorised for publication, have already been identified as "proceedings in Parliament" to which subsection 16(3) would apply. This would not prevent Senator Colston or Mrs Smith from giving their accounts in court of relevant events. However, the statements which the Senate authorised for publication could not be used in court proceedings to support or contradict those accounts. Nor could they be used for any other substantive purpose in Court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The same position applies in relation to facts or matters dealt with in any other documents forming part of the "parliamentary proceedings" as defined. It would be necessary to establish the facts or matters in question for purposes of any court proceedings without reliance on the parliamentary proceedings. This suggests serious problems may arise if the originals of any key documents eg, travel vouchers were to be tabled or presented to Parliament. In relation to answers to questions arising in Estimates or answers to questions on notice, the same limits apply to the use that could be made fo the answers as applies to other documents forming part of parliamentary proceedings, as outlined above. The information contained in the answers would need to be established in court other than by reliance on the answers provided to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5645"> Senate or its Committees. Nor could there be cross&hyphen;examination in court of any person based on what may appear prior inconsistent statements by them in parliamentary proceedings. Hence, the greater the relevant information or material that becomes part of "parliamentary proceedings:, the more that that information or material will not effectively be open to questioning and testing in any court proceedings, and the actual parliamentary proceedings will not be able to be used to establish key facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The legal position created by s.16 outlined briefly above points to the following conclusions:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, has written to Senator Faulkner, outlining his views as to whether any difficulties would be occasioned by a Senate inquiry into statements made by Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Colston and Mrs Christine Smith and presented to the Senate on 24 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have been invited to comment on the letter, of which I have a copy, in light of my memorandum of 18 April 1997 on the impact of parliamentary privilege on a criminal investigation. I offer the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In determining the likely impact of a Senate inquiry on a criminal investigation and possible subsequent prosecution, the scope of any inquiry is clearly important. Mr Evans says "the proposed Senate inquiry would not be into the same matters as are subject to police investigation". Mr Evans envisages an inquiry confined to the truth of the statements, which are already immune from use in criminal proceedings as they are proceedings in Parliament within the meaning of s.16 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987</EMPHASIS> . It is a matter for judgment whether a Senate inquiry into these matters could in fact be confined in a way that did not trespass more broadly into matters the current subject of criminal investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Evans notes that a Senate inquiry would not create "insurmountable difficulties". This seems to acknowledge that at least some difficulties might arise. The inability to cross&hyphen;examine a person in relation to their parliamentary evidence is acknowledged "as a limitation on either the prosecution or defence in seeking to attack the veracity of (`the persons's) court evidence". Whether if further statements and evidence are taken this would "only marginally increase" the difficulty, as contended by Mr Evans, is again a matter for judgement. As I indicated in my first memorandum, it is difficult in advance of knowing the outcome of a criminal investigation to identify what material may be relevant to any charge that might eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The one area in the letter of Mr Evans that I consider significantly down plays the effect of an inquiry is in relation to documentary evidence. Mr Evans suggests that if documentary evidence, not being documents formulated for the purpose of the Senate inquiry, was presented to a Senate Committee and authorised for publication it would "depending on its nature. . . .thereby attain the same status as the statements by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith and could be used in legal proceedings." Mr Evans suggests that if there was a concern about particular evidence "the committee could avoid any difficulty by not ordering the publication of the documents".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Presumably what Mr Evans has in mind is that the originals of eg, travel documents would not be tabled, only photocopies, so that the originals would still be available for use in Court. I have adverted to this issue in paragraph 9 of my earlier memorandum. The fact that evidence before a Committee is not published ensures that it cannot be ordered to be produced in court (see s.16(4) of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5646"> the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act</EMPHASIS> ). If evidence is treated as "in camera" this will avoid matters being placed on the public record and then becoming immune from being tested in a court. This has been one particular concern raised in relation to s.16. However, it will not avoid the basic difficulty, namely, that evidence given to a parliamentary committee that may be critical to a criminal trial cannot be tested or questioned before a court. The fact that material is kept confidential does not help if that material represents key evidence that would be of importance for the proper trial of an issue that ends up before a Court. Nor may it be politically practicable to take evidence in camera, given the great public interest and the fact that the material is not of its nature inherently sensitive information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. The `Brook Island Trial' took place on North Brook Island in February 1944. It was the culmination of various tests which had been conducted in the Innisfail area. Aircraft weapons, comprising both gas filled bombs and various types of gas spray were tested using Beaufort bombers from Bowen. The effects were measured on Japanese&hyphen;style bunkers and foxholes containing goats. Chemical sampling equipment was installed, and troops landed at various times after the bombing in different types of anti&hyphen;gas protection equipment. The testing of mustard gas on volunteers took place on the mainland at Innisfail. This physiological research was to determine the effects of mustard vapour on the human body under tropical conditions. Other tests conducted at Innisfail included the tolerance of man to dibutyl phthalate, which was used to suppress the vector of scrub typhus, and the effect of wearing anti&hyphen;gas clothing on the ability of troops to perform normal duties and do heavy work in a tropical rain forest. Details of the testing are summarised in the `Gillis Report', which was tabled in Federal Parliament on March 1987 by the then Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There was no Army hospital at Woodstock. The 2/14 Army General Hospital was located in Townsville. During the mustard gas trials at Innisfail, a ward at Innisfail hospital was dedicated for use by the medical and scientific staff conducting the trials. The ward was used from 1943 until the end of 1944 when the Field Experimental Station and the 1st Field Trials Company were moved to Proserpine. Medical records or case histories were maintained on all volunteers, not all of whom were hospitalised. Most, if not all, of these case histories are contained in `Chemical Warfare&mdash;Trials', Australian War Memorial Series 54, 179/5/7, Parts 1 to 10. These records are open for public access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. Personal medical records were maintained during the trials and would have formed part of the volunteer's medical record. At the end of the war, the medical records of all ex&hyphen;servicemen were sent to the then Repatriation Department in the State of enlistment of the member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Brook Island was used for the aerial delivery of mustard vapour. Hinchinbrook Island was not used for testing purposes, but was used occasionally as a staging area for personnel waiting to go to Brook Island to check the equipment after bombing had taken place. There is no evidence that Dunk Island was used for any military activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Current estimates are somewhat uncertain however the best information available puts the rate of clearing across Australia at approximately 400,000 hectares per year. Research is underway which should provide a more accurate assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Data on vegetation clearing in these countries are not currently available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Most recent studies found the rate of land clearing in Queensland to have averaged 308,000 hectares per annum from 1991-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Bushcare integrates and significantly enhances several former vegetation programs including the Save the Bush and One Billion Trees programs. These programs were funded in 1996-97 in Queensland for $229,250 and $85,400 respectively. In addition the Wet Tropics Tree Planting Scheme received $1,472,601 and the Sugar Coast Environment Rescue Package received $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) State agencies are eligible for funding under the State-Commonwealth component of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is my intention that about 80% of funding for Bushcare will go toward community grants and on-ground outcomes. The State-Commonwealth component in partnership with State agencies will therefore be a lesser percentage of funding. Allocations for both community and State components will be based upon the merit of project proposals received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Although there is considerable uncertainty in the inventory data at this stage, the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (1994) suggests that the category "landuse change and forestry" accounts for 26% of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>

Thus the access and equity focus will be on the training needs of the individual, rather than on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5655"> their membership of a specific group. Of particular benefit to women with child care or other responsibilities will be the introduction of part&hyphen;time traineeships and other flexible arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1996, the National Women's Vocational Education and Training Strategy was endorsed by State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. The Strategy sets a national direction for governments, industry and providers of vocational education and training to ensure that the needs of women are consistently addressed as a priority in policy making, planning, resourcing, implementing and monitoring vocational education and training. Key outcomes expected from the strategy include a broader distribution of women across all fields of study, an increase in the number of women with qualifications at all levels and an increase in the participation and improved outcomes for specific groups of women, including young women. A wide range of implementation projects are being funded ($1.3 million) by ANTA to support the National Women's Vocational Education and Training Strategy. Projects include training and staff development, skills recognition, standards and curriculum, equity and change, decision making and continuous improvement measures</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator Ellison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The cut in funding, $1 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $9.2 million in 1998&hyphen;99, is less than 2% of funding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the Program over the current budget cycle. Payments to existing Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The CRC Program will be subject to an efficiency dividend. A 3% dividend will apply in 1998&hyphen;99 and a 1% dividend will apply each year thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. Those undertaking public good research should be free to seek funds from all possible sources: from industry and from the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No simple criteria can be outlined, but relevant factors to be considered would include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the perceived benefits of the research area for Australia's socio&hyphen;economic objectives (social, health, environmental, economic, defence, rural, cultural etc);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the availability of satisfactory financial resources, facilities, and people with appropriate skills&mdash;all in relation to competing demands;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the timescale that might be necessary for a satisfactory outcome;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the degree of any spillover benefits that might be associated with the research (for example, in enhancing skills that might also be applied in other useful areas, that might lead to the identification of opportunities, or that might contribute to the solution of other problems); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the existence or absence of similar research being undertaken in other countries. Clearly, assessment of factors such as these might often require a wide range of consultation of expert and other opinion. It is for this reason that Australia has evolved advisory mechanisms and priority&hyphen;setting mechanisms of the kind described in Section 1 of the Science and Technology Budget Statement 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) 1.62% is the most recent estimate (for the year 1994&hyphen;95).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Recent comparisons are available in Table 7 of the Science and Technology Budget Statement 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The differences are a matter of concern in that the Government believes Australia should always strive to increase its investment in R&amp;D and not complacently accept the status quo however reassuring it may appear to some. Australia's public sector R&amp;D is relatively well funded, while R&amp;D expenditure in Australia's business sector is relatively low&mdash;see Tables 8 and 9 of the Science and Technology Budget Statement 1997&hyphen;98. Some improvement is apparent in data the Australian Bureau of Statistics has published subsequent to release of the Statement&mdash;Australia's business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5657"> expenditure on R&amp;D has now increased to 0.87% of GDP (in 1995&hyphen;96), so that Table 9 should be read with that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Several mechanisms are in place&mdash;for example, the R&amp;D tax concession, the R&amp;D Start Program, and other AusIndustry activities&mdash;to encourage higher levels of R&amp;D expenditure and greater innovation in the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) It is clear that most of today's wealth has emerged from past technological developments and that most of these are linked to advances in scientific understanding. Beyond that, the links between research and development, future wealth and jobs are highly complex and not yet well understood while lifestyles are partly a matter of choice that will depend upon levels of wealth and the nature of jobs. Around the world, a substantial number of studies is proceeding in relation to the implications of technological change, including some work being undertaken in relation to the OECD's Technology, Productivity and Jobs Project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) No, because the Government is maintaining public sector R&amp;D at levels which are relatively high in OECD terms, and at the same time has a number of measures in place to encourage more R&amp;D in the business sector (see answer to question 6(d)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) No. Higher education institutions have received separate indexation for salary increases on the basis of the Safety Net Adjustment (SNA) determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The SNA for 1997 provides indexation of 1.3 per cent. If institutions wish to provide </PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a salary increase over this amount, they are responsible for initiating their own reforms to achieve the productivity improvements necessary to fund an increase. The Government also adjusts the non&hyphen;salary component of funding to maintain its real value, based on the Treasury Measure of Underlying Inflation (TMUI). The TMUI is based on the consumer price index but removes elements affected by seasonal and policy factors. In 1997 the TMUI is equivalent to 2.9 per cent. It should be noted that the Government has also provided substantial increases in funding for research. Over 1996 levels, funds for targeted research programs rise by $22.4 million, $50 million and $40 million, representing increases of 5.8 per cent, 13.0 per cent and 10.4 per cent in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively. In total, $90 million has been provided for research infrastructure and $39.3 million for Collaborative Research Grants and Australian Postgraduate Awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Yes and yes. See the answer to question 6(d).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Yes. In very broad terms, the Government's science and technology policy is to maintain the strength of science and technology in Australia's public sector, strengthen innovation within the business sector, and improve linkages and synergies between public sector research and business innovation. A more extensive outline of the thrust of the Government's policy exists in the document Investing in Tomorrow, released prior to the 1996 election, while immediate policy priorities are provided in Section 5 of the Science and Technology Budget Statement 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
