<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment. Is it true that the agreement between the Queensland government and Suns Metal Corporation over the Korea Zinc Refinery on environmental risk management states that `The capacity of the zinc ferrite storage ponds is to be limited to 1.1 million cubic metres' and that `within seven years of the commissioning of the refinery, Suns Metal Corporation shall commission a reprocessing plant capable of reprocessing all zinc ferrite stored in the ponds'? The zinc refinery's impact assessment statement says categorically that `a plant for the processing of zinc ferrite will be installed at the Townsville plant.' Is this not a far cry from what you told the Senate in answer to a question I asked on 10 February, that ultimately the waste will be shipped back to Korea where it will go through a new process? Minister, why did you mislead the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

If the process can be proved and implemented&mdash;this is as I recall&mdash;in Queensland, which has to be done within a period of seven years, then it would occur in Queensland. If it cannot be proved up&mdash;as I said to you, this process is being developed at the moment in Korea and, as I understand, it is not complete&mdash;then the wastes, as I recall it, will be transferred to Korea for reprocessing. I do not know whether you have all the EISs, but if you go back to the agreements with the Queensland government you will find that what I have just said to you is the exact and correct position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, you say that I am filling in the gaps, but I am not the Minister for the Environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous question you asked was to seek a comparison between what is required in Tasmania in relation to waste&mdash;and, at the moment, it is being dumped offshore, which was proved by our friend across here&mdash;and what is going to happen in Queensland. What I said to you is that the process that is to be adopted in Queensland is arguably better than that for Tasmania because ultimately all the waste is to be reprocessed. So that is a better outcome, which was the point I made on the last occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Elang Kakatua development may be used for the development of other projects in the area. It is located in the production sharing contract zone of cooperation A91&hyphen;12, which is held by BHP Petroleum 42.42 per cent, Santos 21.42 per cent, Petroz 14.95 per cent and Inpex Sahul Ltd 21.21 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Undan gas condensate discovery is also in the production&hyphen;sharing contract area, as is the Bayu gas condensate discovery, which is held by Phillips Petroleum 60 per cent, Oryx 25 per cent and Hardy Timor Gap Petroleum 15 per cent. Bayu and Undan are expected to be declared discovery areas by the joint authority this year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BHP Petroleum is investigating the viability of development via an offshore LNG processing facility, either in the zone of cooperation or just outside it. Phillips is investigating the viability of development via an LNG plant onshore at Darwin, and the first LNG cargoes are possible by the year 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Elang Kakatua development follows the last meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation, which was convened by my counterpart under the chairmanship of General Sudjana in November 1996. At that meeting we reviewed the progress made in the explor

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, with this government in power, nearly all of area A is under active exploration. This is indicative of the petroleum industry's confidence in the exploration potential of area A and the progress being made towards the development of petroleum production within the Timor Gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, a total of about 15 million barrels of oil is currently forecast to be produced from the fields. That is valued at some $400 million. While not as large as the Laminaria project which is adjacent but in Australian waters, it is a significant development. The petroleum produced from this project will be subject to production sharing arrangements with the joint authority administering the zone of cooperation on behalf of Australia and Indonesia and the companies.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, did you say in October 1995 that the then Prime Minister, and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . forced Mr Blount to buy his way out of the blackmail by surrendering a huge and totally unwarranted dividend payment to the government, which treats Telstra as a cash cow and not as a means of providing high quality telecommunications services to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, has your attention been drawn to an article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  which reports that the Telstra board and the Department of Finance are investigating whether Telstra can afford to increase its final full dividend payment to the government? Minister, will you now rule out any increase in Telstra's dividend payment to the Commonwealth, consistent with your earlier stated beliefs, or were your statements merely opportunistic posturing?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="898" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to confirm that they were not anything of the sort. In fact, I do not recall precisely what I said back in October 1995, but I can tell you roughly and, for your purposes, I think, quite suffi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="899"> ciently. What Mr Keating was trying to do when he was desperately trying to plug that budget deficit gap was to insist initially that Telstra should sell off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> . He thought he would make the odd billion or two on the side, and that that would help him with his problem. When, of course, Telstra would not go along with that because they saw that as an integral part of their total approach, he was then very keen on breaking up various elements of the business. As we know, he confessed all on, I think, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> &mdash;one of those programs&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Vision Stream.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not Vision Stream. He was certainly keen on selling off Mobilenet. He would have sold off OTC, as we know, if he had had his way when the duopoly was first established. Of course, at the end of the day he was putting Mr Blount in a position where he had to make some sort of compromise offer. That resulted in a very significant dividend payment, as well as two additional early repayments of outstanding loans of, I think, $150 million each.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is quite clear that far from Mr Keating having any interest in improving the quality of telecommunication services in allowing Telstra to invest any excess proceeds, he was intent simply on taking the money from them to fix his bottom line problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as any article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is concerned, it is purely speculative. I have read it. I am not aware of any accuracy attached to it. Any decisions that are taken in relation to Telstra&mdash;the privatisation of which you opposed tooth and nail, and which of course is now subject to scoping studies and to a report from the Senate&mdash;will proceed and will be very much to the benefit of ordinary Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that on principle you lot won't want to subscribe. You are a bit like the trade union movement in Britain. Back in 1984 or 1985 when the union movement was so ideologically opposed to privatisation, they advocated to their membership that they should not participate in the share issue. Of course, the union members, having more sense than their masters, promptly went out in the face of that total boycott and subscribed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the tune of about 95 per cent and mostly doubled their money in the first month. So the workers knew what was good for them. I am sure this time around the last people they will be taking any notice of are the opposition because they know that you could not give a damn, they know that you are not really interested in anything other than pursuing your own little power games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the privatisation of Telstra will be very much in the best interests of all Australians. The scoping study and Finance will be making a number of decisions that will be highly beneficial in due course. They will be made in the course of the budget processes, and they will not be announced prematurely in this chamber.</PARA></ANSWER>

The suggestion that somehow Mr Howard and I were at odds, let alone that somehow I was rebuked, is absolutely and totally a fabrication and distortion.

That, of course, was not apparent last night when we had Gary Gray saying that leadership was about taking a position and never saying you are sorry and Mr Beazley saying, `Of course, we had to defend our record.'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it is good news for the global economy and particularly for Australia. The World Trade Organisation negotiations were all about liberalising markets, and I have to say that Australia, fortunately, has been at the forefront of trade liberalisation in this area. There are something like 68 countries, including Australia, who did make offers covering current and future market access liberalisation, and those countries represent something like 93 per cent of that $600 to $800 billion world telecommunications trade market. In fact, equipment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> manufacturers benefit to the tune of about $600 million a year and the total level of exports is, I think, around the $2 billion mark. So Australia is very well placed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what we can look forward to is not only a reduction in prices and an increase in quality of service but also some very significant falls in international call rates. There has been a cartel operating for far too long in the international arena on accounting rates, and that has very much worked to the detriment of countries like Australia. There is no doubt that when the WT negotiations are ratified on 1 January next year we can look forward to a much better outcome than we have at the present time. But a lot of that will depend upon the extent to which the political process in this country remains committed to these sorts of reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1980s and early 1990s, we had this lot over here championing reforms in all sorts of areas. Of course, we supported them because those policies were right. When they wanted to go down the privatisation track, we were in there defending them. That is why it was absolutely breathtaking to hear Mr Beazley say last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We weren't actually in favour of holus-bolus privatisation. We were prepared to keep in the public sector things that we thought, because of the services they were performing, ought to stay in the public sector, like Telstra. We never actually got that differential across to the public, and that was probably as much of a problem for me as just about anyone else in the party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It sure is a problem, because if one thing is absolutely clear, it is that Mr Beazley was at the heart of the whole privatisation drive. He was the Minister for Finance during critical periods, not only in relation to a whole raft of privatisations but particularly in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, after you had issued that utterly misleading prospectus statement under the name of Mr Willis. So for Beazley to talk in those terms, saying, `We weren't actually in favour of holus&hyphen;bolus privatisation' just suggests the bloke needs a nose transplant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you seriously think that you are going to be able to go through to the next election talking in those sorts of terms and not come 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="906"> to grips with the reality that the public thought that you were lying, that you were out of touch and that you can somehow walk away from promises that you adhered to for over a decade or more and still retain a shred of credibility, you have a very big think coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we need these sorts of policies to keep Australia efficient, to keep Australia in the top half dozen countries in the world, committed to a liberalisation of telecommunications markets. We have gone a long way. We ought to go a lot further.

Minister, in answer to questions yesterday, the minister also said that the PADS unit proved more accurate because it `hit the target eight times out of nine' and so on. Minister, is it a fact that no-one contests the superior accuracy of this equipment, which is why 10 units were purchased for trial, authorised by me in 1990? But is it also a fact, Minister, that the RAAF subsequently found that this equipment put in danger the lives of the crew of the aircraft that was delivering it? This is also contained in the departmental brief provided to the minister in April last year. Mr Air Safety of Australia utterly ignored the explicit danger to the lives of search and rescue air crews when he authorised Airservices Australia to go ahead and purchase this equipment. I seek the leave of the Senate, again, Madam President, to table the full departmental brief that lays this out.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does the government agree with Mr Fraser that Australia's manufacturing trade imbalance, which has risen from $2 billion per year in the 1970s to over $40 billion now, stems partly from, firstly, the fact that our trading partners have not reduced their trade barriers as rapidly as we have and, secondly, because Europe and North America having either heavily subsidised or restricted market access for key Australian export products?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point being made is that what we are seeing in Australia&mdash;coming from Western Australia, Senator Murray will appreciate this&mdash;for the first time is a major move to downstream processing. Here we are as a country that has a large comparative advantage but for many years has not been into downstream processing. There have been a whole lot of reasons for this. A lot of them have been industrially related. When you get to the bottom line, because of things such as work practices, it has not been feasible to do it.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I asked Senator Hill a question about small business perceptions of the economy and the fact that 80 per cent of Australia's small business proprietors believe the Howard government's policies either are working against them or have no real impact. That question arose from a survey of small business opinion published yesterday by the Yellow Pages small business index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, of course, avoided the question substantially. This government has made the primacy of small business a feature of its election promises and a feature of its economic pronouncements since the election.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic adviser to the Index, Dr John Marsden, said that the disenchantment stemmed, first, from the failure of economic growth and recovery to flow through to small business and, second, from the sector's frustration with perceived Federal Government inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"More than 80 per cent of proprietors surveyed still see the economy as in recession or standing still and nearly 80 per cent believe the Government has not helped small business at all," he said.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">And so it goes on. It is quite a damning review by the so-called beneficiaries of this government's program for small business!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this survey does is hold a mirror up to business activity in the Australian economy, and that mirror reflects the reality. The reality is at odds with what this government proclaims the circumstances to be. The reality is a lot less attractive than the government would have you pretend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighty per cent of small business people express a disenchantment with the government because their businesses face difficult times or their businesses are on that list giving the record level of bankruptcies in small business that have occurred in the December quarter in this nation. Small business people are not ideologically predisposed to attack the government&mdash;indeed, it is fair to say that the small business community are mostly supporters of the government&mdash;but they do so because of the economic circum 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stances this government has driven their businesses into and the realities they have to cope with day in and day out by the under&hyphen;performance of this government on its election promises. They do it reluctantly; but they do it because it is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response here is feeble and facile. The government purports to know better than the business community does. The government has said three things in its response: first, that the quotes I gave in my question were selective. They were not. The quotes I gave were the conclusions of the survey. The answers given by the minister were selective. He quoted some balancing statistics in the detail of the survey, which are the best and most positive statistics the government could find, but they do not go to the conclusion which is damning to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government said that things will be better in the future. Well, small business does not believe that. What small business says, overwhelmingly, is that the future for their companies will be bleaker and the future prospects will be worse. That is not a vote of confidence in the government; that is not an expression of confidence in the economy either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the minister said, `Well, we cut the budget deficit last time.' That is what the government has paraded its credentials on, but that is part of the problem. Part of the problem is that they cut $274 million out of business support programs. It is no wonder small business is complaining. The government has slowed the Australian domestic economy down.

But what Senator Cook would not tell the small businesses, if you accept that argument that many of them feel like they have not left the recession, is who took them into the recession in the first place. Senator Cook does not tell small businesses that the cabinet that he was a member of caused the recession and that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, told small businesses we had to have. In other words, Mr Keating and Senator Cook's previous cabinet agreed to the fact that their only solution to Australia's economic woes was to create a recession.</PARA>

What Senator Cook said was that many small businesses believed they are still in a recession. What I am telling you, Senator Schacht, is that the government you were a part of caused that recession. You go out and run a survey and say, `Would you as small businesses like to go back to Labor interest rates? Do you want to go back and pay Mr Keating's interest rates, Senator Schacht's interest rates and Senator Cook's interest rates?' Because under you guys, when you pulled the levers of Australia's economy, you

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were in small business when you guys were sitting around the cabinet table and you went to AGC or Custom Credit because you wanted to borrow $100,000 to extend your small business, to employ more people or to buy some plant and equipment, then AGC or Custom Credit would quote you 30 to 32 per cent. If you go there now, those interest rates have come down significantly&mdash;massively&mdash;to below 10 per cent. There have been three interest rate reductions already under our government totalling 2&frac34; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next plank of your argument, Senator Cook, was that, because we slash the budget, it is bad for small business. Your small business policy&mdash;and I am glad you have actually announced the policy today&mdash;for your next term in government is to increase government spending to help small business and to increase growth. You have said, `Let us put up the deficit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been searching for your policies. Former Senator Evans apparently has torn up your 250-page platform and you are going to start from the basics again. He has said, `It is an open book and we're going to start writing.' Senator Cook has filled in the first page now: `We're going to help small business because these nasty Liberals have decided to get rid of all the deficits that we've created.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is page 1 of former Senator Evans's policy. This is the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, who would be the Treasurer of Australia if you guys won an election again. If you read the classic book by Mr Edwards, you will know that the former Prime Minister thought Gareth Evans was so good.    Honourable senators, do you know what Mr Keating used to do when Gareth came around to knock on the Prime Minister's door? Mr Keating hid in the cupboard, because Gareth was out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Australian people that, if Gareth Evans is starting to rewrite the policy book for the Australian Labor Party from scratch, and the first page has been filled in by Senator Cook, their first policy is `We're going to increase spending. We don't think the Liberals should be reducing the deficit. We don't 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="913"> think we should be bringing down interest rates. We shouldn't be reducing inflation. We shouldn't be changing the unfair dismissal laws. We shouldn't be cutting Labor's red tape. We shouldn't be doing all of those things for small business.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Cook to take note of the answer given in question time today by Senator Hill on the Yellow Pages report. When I was small business minister, I used to consistently quote the Yellow Pages report. I want to point out that, even when it contained uncomfortable information for me and the government of the day, I never bagged the Yellow Pages report. I said it was a creditable survey&mdash;the best survey in Australia on where small business attitudes are at on a quarterly basis. Even when the information was uncomfortable, I never bagged this survey. I had the honour to actually launch this survey way back in 1993, when it was first established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook has given, in both his question today and his motion to take note, all the figures that really point out how badly this government is going in the small business sector. According to this survey, in just 12 months the Howard government has gone from being seen as the great saviour, the enthusiastic saviour, which the small business community believed, to 80 per cent of Australia's small business proprietors now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believing that the government's policies are either working against them or have no real impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an astonishing change. The media release from Yellow Pages points out how strongly the small business community supported the Liberal government in the first survey in May last year after the last election. In less than 12 months, there has been a sea change in attitude&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On their anniversary&mdash;the 52nd week of the first year&mdash;there has been a sea change. The reason is that this government has talked the economy down. It has flattened the economy. That is the reason there are interest rate reductions. It is because the economy is going flat under the mismanaged macro-economic performance of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). He has created a lack of consumer confidence. When there is a lack of consumer confidence, there is a lack of confidence in purchasing from, overwhelmingly, the 800,000 small businesses in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser, has been absolutely undistinguished in his performance in the first 12 months, when you would think he would be helping small business. For example, he will not commit himself to introducing legislation to strengthen the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act which help small business protect themselves against the economic power of big business. It has gone off to a House of Representatives committee. I think he would hope, for his friends in the big end of town, that it dies there in that committee.</PARA>

There is not even voluntary regulation to protect hundreds of thousands&mdash;maybe not hundreds, maybe tens of thousands, probably approaching 100,000 in the years to come&mdash;of small businesses who are franchisees. There is no protection at all. This minister has wiped them out. He has washed his hands of it. That is not giving confidence to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has also allowed the petrol code negotiations to collapse&mdash;negotiations we were involved in, while we were in government, to ensure that petrol retailers got a fair say, a fair go.

Senator Schacht, as the former minister for small business, no wonder you choose to leave the chamber. The one thing that you did was certainly make small businesses smaller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did not matter where small businesses were in Australia, the policies of the previous government did absolutely nothing to help them. In particular I refer to the small, family owned and operated businesses; I think there are some 600,000 of them in Australia. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are the ones who rejected the Labor Party in droves at the last election because of the policies that they had been faced with over the previous 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian families and small businesses are, once again, big winners from this government's policies. Only last week, two other major banks&mdash;the ANZ and Westpac&mdash;followed other banks by cutting interest rates. The standard variable home loan rate was cut to 7.55 per cent. They are the lowest rates in 23 years. Home buyers, many of them families with family businesses&mdash;many small business people are also home buyers&mdash;are saving an average of $246 per month in repayments on the average $100,000 loan over 25 years. Other small businesses and businesses that are somewhat larger, with loans of half a million dollars, have been given $7,500 savings in interest. Under the Howard government, after the last 11 months, Australia has the lowest variable home loan rates in 23 years, it has low inflation, it has strong business investment and it has record company profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what, in contrast, Senator Cook, did you and your government give us over a period of 13 years?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook, I am not misquoting. I am telling you that the variable home loan rate was 17 per cent in 1989 and 1990. You do not dare dispute that fact. Small business loans, particularly those of lots of small businesses I know in rural communities, had variable loan interest rates well in excess of 20 per cent in 1989 and 1990. It was those high interest rates that crippled many a primary producer throughout 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="915"> this country on their own, without the effects of many other things such as commodity prices and droughts. You alone, when in government, with interest rates of up to 27 per cent, were responsible for many primary producers losing their family farms and businesses. You presided over credit card rates of 25 per cent in 1990&hyphen;91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can look back on your record without any pride whatsoever because of the hardship that you placed on small businesses throughout Australia, particularly in the late eighties and early nineties. Plus, in that time, there was the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. That is your record. You should hang your heads in shame rather than come in here and have the temerity to make some criticisms of what this government is trying to do for small business. The small business deregulation task force, which has presented its report, received a glowing report card from many of those organisations which read the report and which are now waiting for the government's response.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the question of Senator Schacht supporting the credibility of the Yellow Pages survey, it is a credible survey. I know only too well how handy it was for an opposition to seize upon it and to attack the government of the day. We did it all the time. I doubt if there was any occasion when the survey ever supported the Labor government. We used it all the time in opposition, so you have taken a leaf out of our book. But it has backfired, Senator Cook, because you were caught selectively quoting from that survey in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the hope that you could drum up a bit of support in the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must know&mdash;and it must be very depressing for you&mdash;that you have absolutely no chance of ever getting back, let alone winning back, the small business community. In fact, you accepted that in your own address to the Senate on this matter. You said that small business would always be philosophically and practically supportive of the coalition government. And it is not just because Senator Schacht used to be the minister for small business: it is because of the track record you had in government. Who can forget, as was mentioned, the 20 per cent&mdash;at least&mdash;interest rate imposed on small business; higher for overdrafts. They were just loan rates. The fringe benefits and capital gains taxes introduced by the previous government meant further complexities and burdens for small business. But, worst of all, what really got to small business with the previous government was the so&hyphen;called industrial relations reform act: the unfair dismissal provisions. That has not been mentioned in the debate yet. The previous government knows only too well what a burden that was on small business and what a deterrent to employment it was. But what a winner it was, for this government, when it introduced its reform act and overturned those burdens on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was one of the major reasons why you lost in the last election. Some 800,000 to 850,000 small businesses, lock, stock and barrel, turned on your government on that one point alone, let alone the recession you visited upon them. Watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last night, we saw just how much the Labor government were struggling to find a constituency. They know they have lost the blue&hyphen;collar workers, the traditional battlers whom they once took such pride in representing. They now admit they have a small elite within academic circles but, for heaven's sake, are they really attempting to win over the small business community with their previous record? I think not.

We know the banks have not yet&mdash;not properly or enough&mdash;reduced their interest rates for small  business. Sure, on home mortgages they have been quick because of the competitive pressures, but the interest rates for business have a long way to go. That will come about by greater pressure and competitiveness on the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know it is still tough for the small business sector and that there is a lot more to do and achieve. Even within the 12 months that we have been in government, we have put a downward pressure on interest rates. We have introduced a task force to recommend to the government how we can reduce red tape. We have moved on certain tax areas for small business and we have taken the tough decisions in regard to balancing the budget. That is also a winner for small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by  Senator Murray today, relating to industry assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I deliberately mentioned wets, dries and muddies when I asked Senator Parer a supplementary question. It was not a throw&hyphen;away line. There are policy tensions and differences emerging within the government about the direction of industry assistance and policy, quite properly and rightly so because there is extreme concern being expressed by many business, primary resource, community and workers organisations about the directions in which we are going. The question as to where members of the government fall, as to whether they are wets, dries or muddies, is really an important one. When I hear someone like Senator Parer repeating the mantra that national boundaries no longer exist for trade or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that globalisation has taken over us all, I despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Try and tell Australian exporters that there are no national boundaries when they battle to get through the non&hyphen;tariff barriers and the industry assistance that is provided to their competitors. Try and tell the Americans or the people within the European Union, or those within the Asian countries that they do not enjoy the benefits of non&hyphen;tariff barriers and industry assistance and they would laugh at you. Frankly, when you hear those answers, you wonder whether we are all living in the same competitive milieu.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the government will not concede that it needs to react rapidly to real problems being expressed by organisations such as the Australian Shipbuilders Assoc Ltd. When they say that they are going to be put at a three&hyphen;year disadvantage, what they are talking about is putting at risk an industry which has grown tenfold in the last 10 years, which operates on a very efficient and productive basis, is extremely competitive and has developed a niche market worldwide, yet which is being threatened, in the case of Austel, with the shedding of 300 of their 800&hyphen;strong work force and the loss of substantial contracts with a total value exceeding $275 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no comfort to people who are going to lose their jobs or their contracts for the government to say, with hands on their hearts, `Jobs are the most important things to us. But hang on, we are going to have a review in the second half of the year. How long that review will take, what the outcome will be, is beyond us all.' Malcolm Fraser, one of the icons of the Liberal world, said in a letter today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To suggest that it is to Australia's advantage to have no protection whatsoever when our access to overseas markets is heavily circumscribed is to suggest that we allow Australian industry, primary or secondary, to be decimated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the words of an ex&hyphen;leader of yours, somebody who is extremely influential within your party. If you cannot listen to other political parties and to business organisations, perhaps you should be listening to people such as Malcolm Fraser. They are telling you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="917"> to turn around, that you are following a policy which is not in the interests of Australian industry and Australian business.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We cannot continue in this manner.

Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) That members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 have been deliberately and wrongly excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas `active service' under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. They are the only Australian Citizens to be treated in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A defined group of citizens, who served in the Malaya area, being members of the Royal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="919"> Australian Navy Defence Forces so affected, have been wrongly excluded, whereas members of the Army and Air Force were not so excluded, and this is supported by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere on public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Allied veterans of 50 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Korean War can have had qualifying eligibility for benefits under the Act. Veterans of South Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States can have eligibility resulting from the Vietnam War. Their service was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Members of the RAN were designated as `on active service' when they served in a designated zone that is within a 12 NM limit offshore from the coastline of Malaya from 9th May 1952 to 1st December 1960. These dates are verified in Declarations by the Governor&hyphen;General, Commander&hyphen;in&hyphen;Chief of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, contained in Commonwealth Government Gazettes No. 40, 5th June, 1952 and No. 82, 8th December, 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Members of the RAN were engaged on operational duties that applied to all service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, including the death by `friendly fire' of a sailor during support operations. This can be attested to be a Naval Flag Officer who witnessed the death on board his ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this authorisation was contained in Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) They were not bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements which were introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962, which act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) the Australian citizens serving in the Royal Australian Navy complied with all the requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) The Department of Veterans' Affairs has indicated it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In Parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not be found. This action would not have been taken had the Parliament been properly informed. Parliament has unfortunately approved the introduction of qualified retrospectivity through accepting these amendments to the Act resulting in an injustice being perpetrated against ex&hyphen;service personnel.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consistent incompetence and maladministration displayed by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no doubt that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) really is a liability. She is a liability to the Howard government. But of great deal more significance is that she is a liability to an entire nation. She has done young Australians a huge disservice by the botched tightening of the actual means test. We have heard again from Senator Vanstone over the last week or so more abject apologies to the Australians&mdash;thousands of people&mdash;who have been affected by her incompetence. Now it is time to stand up and say, `Those sorts of apologies are not good enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Austudy fiasco is the sort of thing that happens when you have a very sloppy and incompetent person, such as Senator Vanstone, in charge of a portfolio. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This is a situation where literally thousands of people have been disadvantaged by this minister's incompetence and failures. Young people's careers have been put on hold. Many people in our community have been traumatised by her actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen recently that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has decided to prop up Senator Vanstone's flagging fortunes. Her confidence is flagging. I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> magazine a quote from the Prime Minister. He said, `Senator Vanstone went through hell at the beginning and came through terrifically.' It is true that she went through hell at the beginning. She has been to hell and back and is in hell again, I am afraid. It is ordinary Australians who are suffering as a result of her incompetence. How extraordinary for the Prime Minister to drop Senator Vanstone's name as a possible successor. I am sure that any prospect of that would finally have been averted as a result of her latest blunder&mdash;the Austudy fiasco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has rewarded Senator Vanstone by sending her a bottle that was labelled Dom Perignon champagne. I stress that it was `labelled' Dom Perignon champagne because I really do think that Senator Vanstone has misinterpreted the Prime Minister's intention. I have publicly urged Senator Vanstone to procure the services of an official taster before she drinks the contents of the bottle. Not only is Senator Vanstone's incompetence and maladministration of her portfolio there for all to see, but you would really have to question the judgment of Mr Howard, the Australian Prime Minister, as a result of his recent actions in reinforcing the behaviour of this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In support of this urgency motion, let us look at Senator Vanstone's record. Major foul&hyphen;up No. 1 was that as soon as Senator Vanstone came into office she refused to set targets to deal with unemployment. Other governments and business set targets and goals&mdash;and she has the most important responsibility of reducing unemployment in this country. But she is the employment minister who said employment targets were unnecessary.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="923">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in early February this year on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program she could not tell Michelle Grattan what a `significant' drop in unemployment meant. She was not willing to put her money where her mouth was. But that was not enough; there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 2 from Senator Vanstone, which really landed Mr Howard a political time bomb. That was her statement that a government that failed to get unemployment down did not deserve to be re&hyphen;elected&mdash;Senator Vanstone's own words, which will be hung around her neck I can assure you of that. What a political liability to her own party she is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was foul&hyphen;up No. 3 by Senator Vanstone. That happened when she decided that she would take a different approach to her parliamentary responsibilities in terms of her accountability to the parliament. She said to the opposition in May that `the reason you will not have some information is that we will not give it to you if we do not want to'. No minister can get away with that. She had to be disciplined by her own leader and she has been on a comparatively short leash in question time, trying to improve her behaviour. It is almost as if she has been to a method acting school. But she slipped the leash today, didn't she, abusing Senator Jacinta Collins in question time. That is this minister's stock in trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 4. Literally within weeks of attaining office she achieved what I thought was the absolutely unachievable by creating a very angry coalition of vice&hyphen;chancellors, university staff and students&mdash;virtually everyone in the higher education sector&mdash;who were absolutely outraged at her unguarded mumblings about a 12 per cent cut in university funding. It was the Prime Minister who again had to come in and try to sort out the mess that this incompetent minister had created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 5 by Senator Vanstone. That was when the HECS fees went up. Science enrolments dropped across the clever country and you had a situation where Senator Vanstone blamed the universities, science minister McGauran blamed the schools, but neither of them blamed themselves or their own government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which had been absolutely responsible for this appalling policy lapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 6 when Senator Vanstone went forth into the ERC to discuss the budget as minister, not with any eye to the social repercussions of the policy she was proposing. She savaged her department to the tune of a $1.8 billion cut leading to the destruction of labour market programs such as skillshare and other mechanisms that had been put in to ameliorate long&hyphen;term unemployment and youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 7. On top of her efforts in relation to slashing labour market programs in this country were cuts of nearly $2 billion to the higher education sector, including the planned academic salary rises. This was a savage blow to the university system. What did she describe them as? I recall it was as `a mere nick'. What was the result&mdash;absolute pandemonium throughout the higher education sector in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, straight away, she moved up to her very memorable major foul&hyphen;up No. 8. That was one of her most infamous achievements in her time as a portfolio minister. That was the invention of the fictitious Wright family. This minister allowed a story to go uncorrected&mdash;front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. In the estimates committee hearing last year she told me that she thought it was far more important to tell Senator Tierney, who is here in the chamber, and her ERC colleagues the truth about the fraudulent Wright family, as opposed to telling the public. It is the public who were misled by Senator Vanstone on the Wright family. She thought, `I will not bother about correcting the record and telling the public the truth.' She did not worry about the readership of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, she did not tell the battlers&mdash;or, as John Howard now refers to them, the mob. No, she did not correct the record. I recall that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as far back as 18 October last year in an editorial headlined `Not Wright' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard is wrong to be tolerant about (Senator Vanstone's) performance. Ministerial heads have rolled for less than Senator Vanstone's folly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What did she do in this? As she has done on so many occasions when she has been caught 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="924"> out by the opposition, she blamed her department. She blamed the officers of her department. That is her stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, she would not take the advice of her departmental secretary in his suggestions about how to respond to the Wright family allegations, would not take the suggestion to tell the public the truth at the earliest possible opportunity. And shortly after Senator Vanstone's extraordinary performance on this matter when explaining her handling of the Wright family matter, her departmental secretary, Mr Hollway, resigned. I suspect that Mr Hollway saw the writing on the wall in relation to Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 9. Senator Vanstone misled the Senate over projections for unemployment reductions when she claimed that the Labor government did not have departmental advice that a five per cent unemployment rate could be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 10 from Senator Vanstone. She misled the Senate over the level of university fees charged in overseas institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there major foul&hyphen;up No. 11 from Senator Vanstone when she even misled the Senate over the Democrats' Internet mail&mdash;you would recall this, Senator Stott Despoja&mdash;during some half&hyphen;smart dorothy dix answer in the Senate. She could not even get that right&mdash;another own goal from this incompetent minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was foul&hyphen;up No. 12 from Senator Vanstone, which goes to her own office administration. Even in day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day responsibilities, Senator Vanstone cannot get it right. Look at the summary of questions on notice that have just been put out by the Senate Table Office. Senator Ian Macdonald&mdash;a coalition senator&mdash;on 7 May asked a question on new work opportunities. How long did it take to get an answer out of Senator Vanstone and her office? It took 225 days to get an answer to one of her own colleagues. For a question on the activity test that Senator Woodley asked it took 204 days to get an answer. Most ministers, even in this government, can do a lot better than that. It is just not acceptable to take well over half a year to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get these sorts of answers out of a minister and her office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major foul&hyphen;up No. 13&mdash;unlucky 13. The latest blunder was to allow genuine complaints about the Austudy actual means test to persist for two months, do nothing about it, and then announce the changes when young people have decided to quit university because they cannot afford to go and when she had caused genuine heartache among poorer families that were caught out by her botched performance, her botched administration. She has admitted that at least 7,000 families will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in the Wright family matter, she blamed the department. That is her stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade: blame the department for the mess over the means test and not accept that the buck stops with her. Well, it does. It is an arrogant dismissal of her own responsibilities. She does not understand the concept of ministerial accountability. It is no wonder that this minister has caused the public outrage that she has. It is no wonder that even the most reasonable people in the community are calling for her to be sacked. You are not worthy of the ministerial responsibilities you hold. You have absolutely abrogated your responsibilities, Minister Vanstone. You should go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I think we have been stretching the bounds of reality somewhat with some of the suggestions put forward by Senator Faulkner who, if he does not want to listen, is welcome to leave the chamber or sit in his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="925"> seat. It is not in accordance with standing orders, Mr Deputy President, to simply wander around the place as if it is a cow paddock that you have got lost in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take just one example. It is apparently a bureaucratic bungle that the coalition has steadfastly refused to set targets for unemployment. Where is the bungle in that? We just have a different view about what the appropriate way is to handle policy. And what is the appropriate way to respond to that sort of questioning? The previous government used to set targets and, if they did not achieve them, they had some reason why they did not; if they did, then they were self&hyphen;satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government would not be happy to set an unemployment rate target and then, if we achieved it, to say, `Oh well, there are no problems. We have achieved our target. We will forget about the people who are still unemployed.' How ludicrous is that? And if members opposite want to look at what their current leader, their leader for the moment, Mr Beazley, has to say about setting targets, they will see that he in fact agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner seems to think that to say that the electorate will be very upset if they cannot see some progress on unemployment is a mistake. I cannot see any mistake in that. I think the electorate elected us because they want to see some progress made in eating into the ingrained stain on the economy, unemployment, that members opposite left. They just waltzed out of 13 years of government leaving high unemployment, and now they are annoyed because we say that the electorate is going to continue to be annoyed unless something is done about this. So I cannot see that that is a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, Senator Faulkner comes in with one of his examples of what he calls incompetence, quoting me as saying, `We won't give them information if we don't want to'&mdash;which, of course, was the practice followed by the previous government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say that at exactly the same time. I said, `We will be more accountable to parliament than you ever were,' but does that stop senators opposite touting around the place, tittle&hyphen;tattling about with lies and deception? No, they have got nothing else to do. They have been drinking vinegar lately. The taste of opposition is fairly bitter, I know. I experienced a number of years of it, but I never reduced myself to that sort of twisted bitterness that I see from those on the other side. Yes, I did say, `You won't get information if we don't want to give it to you,' but I did add the rider which anyone who has experienced opposition would add; that is, that we will be more accountable to parliament than the people on the opposite side of the chamber ever were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, I apparently upset the vice-chancellors. They were upset&mdash;I admit that&mdash;to be told that there was a big black hole left by Mr Beazley and that we had to make a contribution to it. For some reason they were upset at the suggestion that, as some of the leading educationalists in Australia, they should have a chance to shape that savings proposal, otherwise it would be shaped by people in Treasury and Finance. It seemed to me to be a sensible proposition to be up front and direct&mdash;as is my wont&mdash;and say, `Look, there is no messing about here; you are not going to be saved from this. We are going to have to make a contribution. Why don't we sit down together and figure out how to do that?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vice&hyphen;chancellors, much to my regret and displeasure, said, `Finding savings is dirty work. Putting the budget back into the black is dirty work. We just want money. We never want to be cut. We never want to know anything about that.' Of course, only 25 per cent of Australian school leavers get the opportunity to go into university. The remaining 75 per cent either go and get a job or do some TAFE training; they are very interested in the budget getting back into the black and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="926"> in being able to get a job because the government can keep its act together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for HECS and science enrolments falling, again Senator Faulkner either cannot be bothered getting the facts right, or is just too damn lazy to look them up, or is intellectually incapable of doing so&mdash;I do not know which. When I last commented on this I indicated that the final enrolment figures at that time were not known to me, and I do not think they were known to anybody else. The figures for applications were known to me. I made the point that the number of science applications had fallen. It had fallen for a number of years. And&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;I indicated that one of the reasons it had fallen was that not enough kids were doing year 12 science; science in year 12 was falling off. That is something that the state education departments might like to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If universities want to attract people to science, they might look at what they are offering. Universities are going to have to become more market orientated to the students, looking at what students want. I do not want universities ever to become businesses, but I do want them to be more business like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said that there had been a savaging of labour market programs. In its last year in government Labor wasted about $780 million on its three least effective programs, with outcomes of about 30 per cent. So if I am going to go to the Australian public, I am certainly not going to say, `Listen, we have been tipping 70 per cent of this money down the drain. Would you like us to keep doing it?' Of course you wouldn't do that. How ridiculous is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner again misleads and deceives in his contribution to the chamber by saying that there had been $2 billion of cuts to higher education. What a load of codswallop and rubbish. I know full well what the reduction in finance to universities is; it is one per cent against their forward estimates. It is not one per cent against last year's figures, but one per cent against what they were thinking they were going to get. They are getting more this year than they got last year. Where the government has made savings is by asking students who get the private 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit of going to university to make a higher contribution. We have made substantial savings there, but let's us not pretend that we have made substantial $2 billion cuts to universities, because that is an outright lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings with respect to universities I still describe as nix; after all, we have given them a one per cent cut against their forward estimates and allowed them to drop postgraduate student load. The dollars per student are roughly the same. The quality of higher education would stay the same if it were related only to dollars, but will improve because of other changes we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the Wright family&mdash;I have said this time and time again, but Senator Faulkner shuts his ears; he does not want to listen&mdash;I do not believe that I did mislead the public about that. When you mislead the public you intentionally go out and tell them an untruth. I did not do that. It has been made abundantly clear that I was led to believe that the Wright family was an actual family. But what was untrue about that? Simply that it wasn't an actual family. The rest of the story is true: that families like that, without the presence of an actual means test&mdash;that is, with simple income and assets tests&mdash;can access social security. The message there is true. The only difference is that if I had said, `This is a construct of a family that could get social security without an actual means test,' there would be no fuss. Instead of saying that it was a construct of a family, I said that it was an actual family, because I was led to believe that it was an actual family. If that is a mortal sin, I should be dead by now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner went on and claimed that there has been some misleading about projections of what the previous government was told. He knows full well, as he was at the estimates hearings, that there was a mistake in an article in the paper. As often happens with some journalists, they quote each other. It is like a talkfest. One person tells someone and they tell someone else, and all of a sudden 50 people know the same thing. It came from one article that was not sourced to me. Someone decided to paraphrase&mdash;with no bad faith, I think; nonetheless they paraphrased wrongly&mdash;and gave an incorrect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="927"> impression. There are a couple of other things he mentioned, but I want to come to the Austudy matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an administrative bungle in the department, and I have admitted to that. I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> described it as `an unprecedented apology'. I noticed that last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, Gary Gray, the national secretary of the Labor Party, took the opportunity to say that in the past they thought leadership was about taking a position and never saying you were wrong. At least we have had the guts to do what Gary Gray says you should have done; that is, that if you had said you were sorry and acknowledged where you had got things wrong, then the result in March last year might have been different&mdash;and you never said you were sorry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats are supporting the motion before the chamber today. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns about the performance of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in this portfolio, but our concern today is as much with the policies of this government in relation to employment, education, training and youth affairs and that economic rationalist agenda that is pursued by this government inasmuch as it is with the performance of the minister herself. To that end, I will be moving an amendment to the motion before us today in which I choose to specify the administration, or maladministration, in the areas of higher education reforms and Austudy specifically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth starting with the most recent example, the one that has been discussed and debated in this chamber over the last few days in relation to the actual means test. One point should be made very clear&mdash;that is, there is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliamentary secretary who has responsibility for Austudy and that is Mr Tony Abbott, who is in the other place. He seems to have played a very minimal role in this whole saga apart from a very fleeting and contrived performance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> when they investigated this issue. So I suspect that that parliamentary secretary has done little to assist matters and perhaps should share in some of the blame that the minister is experiencing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administration of the actual means test has been incompetent, it has been maladministered, from the choice of the ABS figures that were used in the imputation right through to the design of the Austudy application form. I again ask the minister and her colleagues: why were the ABS figures chosen? Is it not the case that they&mdash;that is, the department and the minister herself&mdash;were advised that the ABS figures were inappropriate, were too harsh and should never ever have been used for the purposes of imputation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing students being judged on their anticipated earnings as opposed to their taxable income. It is outrageous. It is no wonder that it resulted in such chaos and maladministration. But, added to that, we saw the maladministration of the hotline. There were departmental officials being cut as a result of budget changes and a hotline was established. We knew that 90,000 students at least would be affected by the changes to Austudy in the budget and yet something like 15 people were staffing a national hotline for a few hours per day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the minister's claim in this place recently that she acted swiftly, again, the Democrats strongly disagree with that. We argue that, if the minister wanted to act swiftly, she should have done so in the first round of enrolments, not the third round. Action should have been taken as early as January considering this issue was debated and brought to the attention of the minister and departmental officials as early as November estimates last year and in departmental briefings with my office in December last year. So these problems were not rectified swiftly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 90,000 people were expected to be affected by the budget changes&mdash;$60 million. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="928"> This is a mean&hyphen;spirited government that will do anything to pursue its economic rationalist agenda, even if it means cutting off 90,000 students&mdash;and, of course, other Austudy changes in the budget included increasing the age at which students were eligible for the independent rate from 22 years to 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats still call on the minister and, again, we argue that this is an incompetent and maladministered move. We argue very strongly that the guidelines&mdash;or, specifically, the chapter regarding the actual means test guidelines&mdash;should be made public. They have yet to be made so. We would call on the minister to do that, just as we call on the minister to reconvene the Austudy references committee to review the guidelines and stick to a pre-election promise that her predecessor, Senator Robert Hill, made&mdash;that is, that the actual means test guidelines would be reviewed. Senator Hill promised to do that, and we call on the government to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the manufactured&mdash;or constructed, as the minister calls it&mdash;Wright family is another example of, yes, the Senate being misled. The minister may argue it was unwitting, but in fact it was not only the Senate but also the public who were misled. The really appalling fact about that whole Wright family saga was not that a couple of kids, a Pajero or a swimming pool were added, but that it in fact perpetuated the negative and regressive notion that people are out there ripping off the system, that somehow there are all these millionaires rorting the system. In actual fact, as we all know, a majority of people who do receive Austudy benefits&mdash;and they are hard enough to get&mdash;are living at 35 per cent of the poverty line levels. It is an outrage that Austudy benefits are so hard to access for many families and, in particular, for those who are below the age of 25 and those from regional and rural families. That was the greatest offence with the Wright family saga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn quickly to the higher education reforms. Last year this Senate passed the most radical and regressive changes ever to higher education. The minister is guilty, yes, of implementing fees and charges in a regime that now means your ability to study is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> determined by your ability to pay. That is through the implementation of up-front fees. We have just seen Melbourne University come up with a benchmark of $110,000 for dentistry. I am sure the poor kids of Australia and the battlers, who have been referred to so many times in this place by the government, are going to be accessing dentistry courses at that price!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the former government is culpable as well in this matter. While I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) moved this motion today, the maladministration of higher education in this country was certainly begun by the former government, which began and helped entrench a system of user pays education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the vice-chancellors being a little upset, they were ropable, and with good reason. Not only were they scared by the idea of a 12 per cent cut across the board, but they have endured a $1.8 billion cut. Their operating grants have been slashed directly contrary to a pre-election promise. This government promised to leave Austudy as it was, to not cut operating grants and to strengthen regional and remote universities. What has happened? We have seen campuses close. The St George campus at UNSW, which Senator Tierney has repeatedly referred to in this place, is closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for lower enrolments, of course applications are down all across this country, specifically in areas such as science. Yes, we have seen the tail wagging and tail chasing. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) argues it is the schools and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) argues that it is universities&mdash;the point being that these are the very areas on which this nation's future prosperity and training in employment rely. Yet science courses, business courses, Aboriginal and Islander courses, education courses and nursing courses have all suffered with reduced enrolments, not to mention specifically mature age student enrolments, which have experienced a decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister referred to students and their representative organisations squealing like stuck pigs and academics living in ivory towers. She has urged academics to dob in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="929"> their colleagues with notes in brown paper bags. This is all offensive and incompetent behaviour. It is behaviour to which the Democrats have strongly objected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to labour market programs, I share some of the concerns that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has put forward today. I want stress that at least 107,000 places have been lost in the area of labour market programs. They have not been compensated for by the introduction of a so-called token green corps, which will provide something like 240 places in the 1996-97 financial year and less than 4,000 places over the next three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How would we know if it came out of the bowels of the department 10 levels down in the bureaucracy and they changed a few details and said that it was an actual family? Are ministers mind readers? If ministers are advised that it is a real family, how on earth can they work out that it is not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also sat through some hearings where the Wright family was considered in great detail. The minister, to her great credit, spent several hours fielding inane questions from your side on this matter. In the end, it was just a mistake within the department. Time and again your government made mistakes, but you never owned up to them; you always tried to cover them up. As soon as she recognised the mistake, the minister came in, as she did this week, and said, `Sorry, we've made a mistake and we'll now fix it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great contrast between your government, Senator Murphy, and ours and that is that when we do make errors we admit them and we correct them. In those far flung

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister has been involved in a very dynamic portfolio that has undergone incredibly rapid change. She has handled it with great ability under very difficult circumstances and, in the case that you have brought up on the actual means test, she made the corrections when she needed to. I would have thought that was a sign of good ministerial leadership in this matter. As usual, your party is just beating up a matter which is, again, like most of the other matters that you beat up, in the end not of great importance out there in the community. They are not marching in the streets over the things you have brought up over the last year. If you have not noticed, your ratings are still down. You are not making any impact and it is about time you became a real opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence my contribution, I want to deal with one issue that Senator Tierney raised with respect to the Wright family. He kept referring to this mistake that was made deep down in the bowels of the bureaucracy. The mistake was made quite publicly, in front of the estimates committee. But the point about that exercise, and it was an exercise that Senator Vanstone went through, was that she&mdash;she will deny it&mdash;clearly gave a press release, to Senator Ferris I think, the same afternoon as the Wright family case was presented to the estimates committee. It was clearly a set&hyphen;up by the minister to grandstand using Senator Ferris.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have not been in this place for very long and you are not particularly smart if you do not think that was a set&hyphen;up&mdash;to be on the front pages of the newspaper, as it was. Unfortunately for Senator Ferris, she got caught out by Senator Vanstone providing her with information that turned out to be inaccurate. But, with respect to supporting the motion moved by the Labor opposition this afternoon, if the 13 matters that the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Faulkner, went through were individual matters&mdash;maybe one, or two, or perhaps three matters that had occurred over a period of a year&mdash;perhaps the performance of Senator Vanstone would be understandable, given her relative lack of experience as a minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Faulkner was able to outline 13 clear examples&mdash;one a month on average&mdash;of Senator Vanstone's poor performance as a minister, of her general consistent incompetence. It is a consistent incompetence. As Senator Faulkner said, even beside the lacklustre performance of some other ministers on the other side, she stands out as a consistently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incompetent minister. Hardly a month goes by without Senator Vanstone being exposed as ignorant or belligerent. We saw it here today. Senator Vanstone started off her contribution by abusing Senator Jacinta Collins. There was no reason for it. She just started abusing her. She did the same in question time. This sort of belligerence from the minister adds to the particular difficulties she gets herself into by her display of ignorance and the totally inept performance she has shown since this government has been in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I suppose we had the penultimate example of incompetence with her capitulation over the Austudy means test. She said she got it wrong. They were the first honest words to flow from the minister's lips since coming to the portfolio. She admitted she got it wrong but she then went on and said, `I got it wrong but it wasn't my fault. It was the department's fault&mdash;it was the bureaucrats' fault.' Notice how Senator Vanstone says, `It's everyone's fault but mine.' If it is not the bureaucrats' fault, it is the previous Labor government's fault. She even said today that it was the press; that the press report her wrongly. So it is everyone's fault but Senator Vanstone's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were not so serious, it would be quite comical because, as I understand it, on the same day Senator Vanstone admits that she got it wrong or her bureaucrats got it wrong she gives herself five gold stars for ministerial performance. I do not know what film she had just staggered out of&mdash;probably the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghost and the Darkness </EMPHASIS>or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mirror Has Two Faces</EMPHASIS>; it certainly was not <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daylight</EMPHASIS>&mdash;but she gives herself five stars. Then she announces to the world that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is so impressed with her performance that he gave her a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne&mdash;French at that&mdash;which costs $150 a bottle. What a boast!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a starring performance from Senator Vanstone. The day she admits that she finally got it wrong, she says, `I'm a five&hyphen;star minister, five gold stars, and I got a bottle of Dom Perignon from the Prime Minister.' Actually, the bottle of champagne says it all about Senator Vanstone: froth and bubble and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="932"> no substance. It really does summarise her performance as a minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last time you saw me, Senator Abetz, was putting a champagne cork in the River Derwent, but that is another story. I do not think too many of Senator Vanstone's backbench colleagues have been sending her bottles of champagne over the past few weeks. It is more likely&mdash;in fact I know&mdash;they have been sending her the streams of correspondence they have had from constituents, highlighting the pain and suffering that this minister is causing their families through cuts to education and employment programs, and also highlighting the unnecessary frustration and anguish caused by this minister's attempt to deny Austudy to legitimate claimants by trying to force the financial costs of university education onto already struggling families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a number of calls at my office in Devonport about this matter. I will give one particular example from the north-west coast of Tasmania where families were participating in the survey of a family's estimated expenditure for the year, which was looking at mortgage, transport, living expenses and working out income levels against outgoings. It was a policy decision taken by the minister and cabinet to use the ABS household expenditure survey. It was a policy decision. She cannot blame the bureaucrats.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This time she cannot blame the bureaucrats. This family who complained to me said, `We're spending $500 a year maintaining a vacant block of land. This is one of our expenses.' Yet they could not claim $500 a year; they had to claim $3,260 a year. Why? Because the government as a matter of policy says you have to use the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey, no matter what the real cost was on the north-west coast of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people wanted to complain, then the minister grandly said to ring the ombudsman. But there is just one problem in Tasmania: we do not have an ombudsman. The ombudsman 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position in Tasmania was abolished by this government. So people had to ring through to Melbourne to complain to the ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they could not get through to the ombudsman, they had to ring the hotline. When they rang the hotline in Tasmania, apparently it took half an hour or 45 minutes to get through because there were so many people ringing the hotline. This is a startling example of the minister's incompetence and inept performance. The Austudy means test incident has brought it to a head for the opposition. She should go, frankly, but we should certainly at this stage be highlighting the consistent incompetence and the maladministration that she has shown.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but let me remind you that the means test basically singled out the self-employed and deemed the total expenditure of a self-employed family to represent available means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 September 1995 I sought to have those regulations disallowed. If that motion had been carried, then we would not have had this problem. I said that the regulations were excessively wide. They took no account of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="933"> fact that expenditure might represent expenditure related to the current and capital outlays of a business, rather than representing available means, and would apply to every worker with an interest in a superannuation trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, family expenditure might represent spending out of gifts and legacies which would be ignored in the case of Austudy applicants from non-self-employed families. I also pointed out that the then government had opposed expenditure taxation as being unfair to families; so why was it fair to means test families on their total expenditure instead of assets and income? My motion to disallow the regulations was not carried because the then coalition opposition, the new government, accepted the undertakings of Senator Faulkner as to how the actual means test would be administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pointed out on 19 October 1995 that the concessions announced by Senator Faulkner created the fundamental problem that we now have regulations that do not mean what they say and we have now had the minister saying what they mean&mdash;it is interesting. My concern was so great about this departure from basic principles of constitutional government regarding the conformity of administration to legislative authority that I commissioned a legal opinion from the Parliamentary Library on the legality of the department's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That opinion, which confirmed my concern about the legality of the department's administration, was forwarded to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on 11 December 1995. More recently, on 5 February this year, I asked the current minister about the actual means test and referred back to my criticism of 27 September 1995. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 October 1995, it was noted that primary industry producer families were intended to have been exempted from the test. Given the long history of departmental incompetence in dealing with or acknowledging legal difficulties with the actual means test, one has to have sympathy with both this minister and her predecessor. Both Senator Faulkner and Senator Vanstone have relied on the department in answering questions in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate about the operation of the actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both senators appear to have been placed in the situation that the advice they have had relayed from the department to the Senate has been defective. In these circumstances, where more than one minister has been let down by the same department&mdash;I had some difficulty in singling out one minister&mdash;the buck stops, unfortunately, with the minister. I would be prepared to support the urgency motion, bearing in mind again that it is just an urgency motion, with the addition from Senator Stott Despoja.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech is a speech which explains the bill. It basically explains at length the reasons for the bill and it puts flesh to the structure of the legislation. As such, it has an important role in the judicial process and an important role for people who want to know what the legislation stands for. For ordinary Australian citizens&mdash;whether they are private citizens or part of the business community or other pressure groups in our society&mdash;the second reading speech explains to them the government's policy, the government's motivation and the broad structure of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech is a very essential and fundamental aid to interpretation, not just by the courts but by the broader com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="937"> munity. As such, the speech should appear on the public record of the parliament and, of course, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is a public record. So it is important in terms of people and groups knowing what the bills are about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the second reading speech is also an important aid in legislative interpretation. As such, it finds recognition in the Acts Interpretation Act. Second reading speeches have often been used by the courts to give meaning to words in the legislation which otherwise may be nebulous or unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to stress the point that Senator Brown made&mdash;that is, all these second reading speeches are of little use to people if they are not readily accessible, and the most accessible way for people is their appearance in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the parliament. If the speeches are not there, people have to go through another process to try to find them and ascertain what the legislation is about. If they are in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, then that is readily accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is documentation which, for instance, is available on the Internet. Therefore, it is more readily available than if you had to try to access the documents from the clerks' office or any other bowel of the parliament. So it is important. I think it is discourteous for the government to spit the dummy and not read these speeches into parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these speeches are a critical aid and should be incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> by Senator Campbell reading them out. We had to do that in the past at times. In the previous government, when leave was not given, we read speeches into the parliament. I think it is important that this be done now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, they were withdrawn. They were ignored in fact by the government&mdash;in this case, by Senator O'Chee. He had the responsibility of being the acting whip for the government at the time. If that is the way the government intends to do business, this place just will not work. I do not think we have faced that situation of a failure to grant leave&mdash;until now, with Senator O'Chee behaving in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do accept that you have to make a political assessment of issues relating to the granting of leave. For example, I noted in question time today that leave was refused on two occasions when Senator Bob Collins sought leave to table a document. According to the government, leave was refused on the basis of the normal courtesies of the place. For those who are unfortunate enough to be listening to this debate at the moment, let me explain what those courtesies are. If a senator wishes to table a document or have a document incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, traditionally he or she would have to show that document to the opposing political party. In the case of an opposition senator, he or she would show the document to the government; in the case of a government senator, to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point was made by government senators during question time that Senator Collins had not shown that document to the government. It is a point that can be accepted, and in the cut and thrust of debate, particularly at question time, we did not hear the opposition take that issue any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this place simply will not work if we have a situation where we do not get a modicum of cooperation from the government. The government may feel that at the moment it effectively has a working majority in the Senate. It may feel very confident about its capacity to stitch together a majority of votes on any issue that comes before the chamber. But the standing orders of the Senate are such that there is always a capacity for senators to use them to ensure that the government has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="938"> grave difficulty in dealing with its legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, better than most in this place, do have an understanding of that. As Manager of Government Business in the Senate for a number of years, I had to deal with a most uncooperative and unreasonable opposition, the now coalition government. I had to deal with filibustering on numerous occasions. It was difficult for the then government, which commanded only a minority of senators, to see its legislative program advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the last election, we now have an opposition which actually understands the need for progress to be made in a legislative program and understands, because of its recent experience in government, that the procedures of this place have to work not only in the interests of oppositions but also in the interests of government. The approach of this opposition is very different from the approach of the coalition when it was in opposition for 13 years. Any serious alternative government will always give a lot of consideration to these sorts of issues. But there is also a responsibility by governments and office holders of political parties to ensure the good operation of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen an example this afternoon of a very inexperienced whip in Senator O'Chee, someone who has demonstrated by his incapacity at times even to attend divisions, his lack of understanding of the workings of this place. I was very disappointed not so much in Senator O'Chee but in Senator Brownhill, who as the responsible parliamentary secretary in the chamber did not override Senator O'Chee's boisterous call to refuse leave to my perfectly reasonable proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that the government needs to take account of. Often the new government comes into the chamber and thanks the opposition for its cooperation&mdash;often privately it thanks the opposition for its cooperation. But the government ought to realise that this has to be a two&hyphen;way street. There also is a need for the government to take seriously its responsibilities for the proper processes and courtesies of this place to ensure that this chamber actually works.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy for a government or an opposition&mdash;frankly, for any individual senator who is so minded&mdash;to up&hyphen;end good order and good process in a chamber like the Senate, where still no one political party has a majority. I hope this is a lesson that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell), who is listening to this contribution by leave, will take on board.</PARA>

Frankly, if the government determines to not grant leave to opposition senators who are opposing courses of action which are in the best interests of this place&mdash;in the interests of progress being made with our routine of business and the good order of our proceedings&mdash;then we have a major problem. That is not the way that we do business. It has not been the way we have done business in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that senior government ministers and those with ultimate responsibility for government business in this place&mdash;that is, the Manager of Government Business&mdash;will take serious account of this, will take Senator O'Chee aside, will counsel him and will indicate to Senator O'Chee that if he is going to be absolutely unreasonable in his approach to the workings of this chamber the opposition will not be minded to bend over backwards to give the level of cooperation that you have seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a two&hyphen;way street. I actually think many in the government understand that that is the case. I believe that Senator Campbell, since he has embraced his new responsibilities as Manager of Government Business, has worked hard in trying to ensure that the Senate's business moves along. I accept that Senator Campbell does understand these things. It might be time, Senator Campbell, for you to communicate that to other office holders in this place.</PARA>

I ask you to exercise some responsibility in this regard because, if Senator O'Chee intends in the future to refuse leave when properly asked for by the opposition&mdash;or any other senator in the chamber for that matter&mdash;to see matters progress quickly and in a proper fashion, inevitably there will be consequences. You cannot expect the opposition to be the only political party in this chamber to be accepting its responsibilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In response to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner), to Senator Bolkus and to Senator Brown I must say that the points Senator Faulkner makes in relation to the cooperation that is required in this chamber to make the place work from the government's point of view and from all private senators' points of view are quite right. He is also right to say that when you are in the job of manager you begin to get a deep and abiding understanding of that, more than do most other people in the chamber. The former Manager of Government Business, Senator Kemp, sits here and nods and Senator Faulkner knows from his own experience that you do require cooperation because if that cooperation is not there from every senator&mdash;because no party has a majority in this place&mdash;the place will not work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not tuned into the Senate towards the end of the debate on that urgency motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well not have been. I cannot pass judgment; I was deep in a meeting at the time with some people who have an interest in my portfolio. Unlike the people who happen to be on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> edges of their seats, listening to the Senate broadcast at the moment all around Australia, I was not tuned into the broadcast at that time. But I will have a look at it. I did seek leave, Senator Brown, to have these speeches incorporated. I have since made sure that they are distributed to all senators. They are available, I am assured, from the Table Office for any citizen of Australia who cares to read them. There is a reference in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  where these bills are introduced to say that they are tabled and are public documents. You now have a set of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative to incorporation has a couple of constraints&mdash;and I do understand why leave has been refused in this instance; Senator Faulkner has made it quite clear why that was the case. If I was required to read them I would at the end of the 20 minutes allocated to the second reading speeches on this package still have to seek leave to have most of the documents incorporated. There are something like 38 pages of finely printed speeches involved in this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it was very bad timing that we sought to introduce 10 pieces of legislation and to have incorporated by leave 10 second reading speeches shortly after a dispute over granting leave. It was very bad timing. But there are 10 speeches, Senator Brown, and I think you now have them in your hand. I would certainly agree with you that it would be far more advantageous for all Australia's citizens and honourable senators if the speeches were to appear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. I will again seek leave, if that is within my prerogative, to have them incorporated. I agree with you: it would be much better if they were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It would not be possible to achieve that without the leave of the chamber, however, because it is impossible to read 38 pages of finely printed documents without having some incorporated by leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I support the fact that cooperation is required in this place. I will to the best of my ability, from the government's point of view, ensure that that takes place. I do thank you, Senator Brown, other independent senators, the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party for the cooperation they have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="940"> shown in exchanges between the whips and the leaders in past weeks and months. It does make it easier to deal with the arduous program the Senate has. From my own point of view, and on behalf of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), I say that that cooperation, from our point of view, will continue as much as possible. Again, taking Senator Brown's point on board in the interests of the Australian people who have an interest in this telecommunications package&mdash;which is very important for Australia&mdash;I seek leave to have those speeches incorporated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes the core elements of a new telecommunications regulatory framework for the era beginning 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together with related bills in this package, it will introduce full and open competition, reinforce and reinvigorate consumer protection arrangements and bring about significant reforms to technical regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will provide an environment in which Australian businesses and telecommunications users will get maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry. The regime will provide a framework within which the Australian telecommunications sector can develop into an industry based on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">world class infrastructure using the latest market driven technology mix; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a multitude of service providers offering diverse and innovative carriage and content services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">contestable market strategies which drive prices down and quality of service up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative package fulfils in full the Government's election commitment to bring about a new era of competition and to establish a world class consumer protection framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications services are an essential component of our lives, both at home and at work. The role they play is becoming increasingly important as technological developments not only provide innovations in traditional telephony services, but allow us to reach out to the world via services such as the Internet and to access financial, education, health and similar services. We are beginning to see the benefits that telecommunications services present when used as a tool in these ways. The future can only be more exciting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technological developments are also presenting significant opportunities for the industry itself. In the year to June 1996 gross product in the communications sector increased by over 12 percent&mdash;an annual growth rate significantly higher than the economy generally. Australia is not alone in witnessing rapid growth in communications industries. Market expansion overseas, and particularly in our region, present new opportunities for export enhancement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable this country to take full advantage of the social and economic opportunities presented by these developments, we must have a telecommunications industry which is constantly challenged to innovate in order to develop new services, increase quality and reduce prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications Act 1991 enabled the introduction of limited infrastructure competition and full resale of telecommunications services. Australian consumers have witnessed significant gains from these developments, however, they were only ever intended to be transitional arrangements in a decade&hyphen;long process that has been progressing in steps towards full and open competition. The package introduced here will achieve that long&hyphen;term objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Facilitating the development of a truly competitive market from a monopoly is an evolutionary process. The Government must progressively remove regulatory barriers and constraints on genuine competitive conduct: it also must increasingly shift responsibility for regulation to the industry itself. Significant efficiency gains can be achieved through greater reliance on self&hyphen;regulation in networked industries such as telecommunications because regulatory structures and arrangements can be better designed to reflect industry and community needs. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="941">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of legislation provides the framework for the telecommunications industry to take responsibility for key areas of regulation over and above the legislative guarantees provided. In the areas of competition regulation, mechanisms are available for the industry to develop agreed approaches to access and pre&hyphen;selection management for adoption by the regulator. Similarly, in addition to foundation consumer protections and technical standards, the industry will have all the tools necessary to develop codes of conduct in consumer&hyphen;related areas and voluntary technical standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The successful development of industry codes will be to the benefit of all players. It is therefore incumbent on all in the industry to fully and constructively participate in these self&hyphen;regulatory mechanisms. The industry itself must provide the necessary resources. Consumer representatives must, where appropriate, have the opportunity to contribute to issues. In this context, I welcome the preparatory work the industry has undertaken in recent times, including work associated with the formation of the Telecommunications Access Forum and an overarching industry forum known as the Communications Industry Forum, to establish self&hyphen;regulatory and consultative mechanisms in anticipation of its future responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self&hyphen;regulation will evolve over time&mdash;it should not be expected to be comprehensive from day one. It requires progressive review and strengthening of self&hyphen;regulatory mechanisms which, in turn, will require industry commitment on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises, however, that in some areas industry consensus may not be achievable, and safeguard provisions exist to enable the regulator to step in and establish standards or arbitrate an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is the core of a package of bills which comprise the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications legislation. The Telecommunications Bill 1996 will replace the Telecommunications Act 1991 (which is repealed by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996). Other key bills in this package include the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996, which sets out the primary industry&hyphen;specific competition policy arrangements, and the Australian Communications Authority Bill 1996, which establishes the new telecommunications and radiocommunications regulator, the Australian Communications Authority. Arrangements for moving to the post 1997 environment are contained in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishes the fundamental regulatory arrangements for industry participants&mdash;carriers and service providers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">re&hyphen;enacts and reinvigorates legislative assurances in regard to community obligations and consumer protection including the universal service obligation, the continued provision of the option of untimed local calls, the customer service guarantee, privacy provisions, law enforcement and defence obligations and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provides the framework for increased industry self&hyphen;regulation through codes of practice;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains the Government's proposed provisions relating to carrier powers and immunities post 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Carrier and service provider regulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no regulatory barriers to entry into the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For regulatory purposes, the bill separately identifies persons who are responsible for regulatory obligations relating to telecommunications network infrastructure&mdash;carriers&mdash;and those persons who provide carriage or content services to the public by using this infrastructure&mdash;service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most cases, carriers will be the owners of network infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carriers are very important to the regulatory scheme because they provide the basic transmission infrastructure on which the supply of carriage and content services to the public rely. Carriers will be individually licensed and subject to charges that recover the costs of regulating the industry. They will also share the net losses incurred in fulfilling the universal service obligation. Any artificial arrangements designed to thwart these policy intentions will be met by swift action by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure providers must have the flexibility to meet the demands of the Australian community by whatever technology they consider most appropri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="942"> ate. The Government is therefore removing the current regulatory distinction between carriers on the basis of the technology they use. Licensing requirements will not be used to place regulatory barriers on the choices carriers make in regard to delivery technology. In addition, the access arrangements included in the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996 will mean that judgements by new and existing operators about whether to build their own networks will need to be made against the option of buying capacity off other carriers on reasonable terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be maximising the opportunities for Australian industry through a licence condition that requires all carriers to have an industry development plan, unless exempted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This arrangement extends the previous regime which has resulted in substantial benefits to the Australian industry, the carriers and the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A carrier's industry development plan would also be expected to include research and development activities that the carrier undertakes for people with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of provisions provide that carriers will not be required to publish information about their plans that may be commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, however, the Government does not intend that these provisions be used as a means of denying useful information to the industry and the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has announced details of a monitoring body to monitor and report on progress with implementation of industry plans. He has also announced that the Government will treat sales to carriers as if they are sales to Government for post 1997 industry development purposes. These policies will support the industry development licence condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes use of a new concept of service provider which includes both carriage service providers (who supply carriage services to the public) and content service providers (such as the providers of broadcasting and on&hyphen;line services). Carriers will be service providers when they provide carriage or content services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Service providers will be regulated by rules established in the legislation, replacing the existing class licence regime. The Government does not intend that the bill be used to regulate the content of content services: content service providers have been included so they can benefit from rights to access services under the proposed access regime. Content will continue to be regulated under legislation such as the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Community and Consumer Obligations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications services are today a fundamental part of social interaction, particularly for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those in remote communities. They also provide a lifeline in emergency situations and are an essential component of business activities. While competition is itself a vital part of the Government's strategy to encourage continuing improvements in service and price reductions, the Government recognises that market forces may not always be sufficient to guarantee outcomes that are in the interests of all consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this bill re&hyphen;enacts many aspects of the consumer protection and community obligation arrangements in the existing Telecommunications Act, in doing so the Government has taken the opportunity to fundamentally reinvigorate those existing arrangements. We have also incorporated additional new protections applicable for an open entry market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the core of the community obligations of the telecommunications industry is the universal service obligation<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS> (USO).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is firmly committed to maintaining a general obligation on the industry to ensure that all people in Australia have reasonable access to the standard telephone service (including customer equipment), payphones, and prescribed additional carriage services on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business&mdash;and a supporting obligation to supply those services on request. The universal service provisions in this bill, while based on those in the Telecommunications Act 1991, incorporate changes to clarify and update the universal service obligation (USO), improve efficiency and transparency, and align it with the open market post&hyphen;1997 regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "standard telephone service" is a carriage service for voice telephony (or for a person with a disability, an equivalent service required to be supplied to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992) which enables end&hyphen;users supplied with the service to ordinarily communicate with other end&hyphen;users supplied with the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is considering the options for upgrading the actual services to be supplied under the USO after receiving the recommendations of Standard Telephone Service Review Group. The legislative arrangements in the bill will, however, enable ongoing review and enhancement of the standard telephone service and the universal service obligations generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The USO provisions presented here will provide for greater clarity about the manner in which universal service providers intend complying with their obligations and establish clear accountability mechanisms for evaluating their performance. This will be achieved through a requirement that universal service providers submit plans on how they will progressively fulfil the USO, with approved plans being publicly available. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="943">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the potential for carriers other than Telstra (which will continue to be subject to price cap arrangements under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991) to become a universal service provider, a provision has been included to enable the regulation of charges for services supplied under the USO, thereby safeguarding the continuing affordability of such services. The bill also provides increased flexibility for the Government to ensure the net cost of the universal service obligation reflects efficient practices, including through use of selection processes such as tendering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carriers will contribute to funding of losses incurred in fulfilling the USO in direct proportion to their share of total "eligible revenue", which is to be defined in regulations, but would include revenue from a broad range of carriage services. Alternative arrangements will enable carrier contributions to be set according to a methodology determined by the Minister, with the agreement of carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the election campaign the Government promised that the option of untimed local calls would be maintained and extended to business customers. This bill fulfils that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A codes of practice regime is established to provide a framework for industry self&hyphen;regulation by means of industry&hyphen;developed codes that are registered with the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The codes regime will supplement and enhance the fundamental consumer protection arrangements established in this bill and to which I have already referred. Codes can address areas of concern to consumers that are currently unregulated. As a failsafe, this self&hyphen;regulation mechanism is backed up by the ability of the ACA to make mandatory standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a list of examples of areas which might be dealt with in codes and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has placed certain limitations on the matters which a registered code or standard may address, including restrictions on dealing with the content of content services or requiring networks to have certain design features or performance requirements (except in relation to billing, quality of service or other prescribed matters). This is to avoid duplication of regulation and unwarranted restrictions on commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Codes and standards must reflect the legitimate needs and interests of all industry stakeholders if they are to work properly. Consultation will occur with the industry, the public and the TIO and, where privacy issues arise, the Privacy Commissioner, in the development of registered codes and the making of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The period for public consultation must be a minimum of 30 days, although the actual period will be a matter of judgement by the ACA or the industry section in developing the code. It is expected that the ACA or the industry section will provide a longer period for public consultation where the issues are complex, but in doing so will need to have regard to the urgency of the need for the code or standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing standards established under the Telecommunications Act 1991 will continue under transitional legislation until replaced by a code or standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Part 10 of the bill requires the TIO scheme to provide for the investigation of complaints relating to carriers and carriage service providers, this is not meant to imply that other sections of the telecommunications industry would be prevented from joining the TIO scheme, or that these other sections of the industry may not establish alternative bodies to perform ombudsman functions in relation to codes or standards. Such options would

The provisions in this bill fulfil that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions establish a general rule that, from 1 July 1997, State and Territory planning and environment laws will generally apply to telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three exceptions to this general rule: first, some standing exemptions for installation of low impact facilities and temporary defence facilities, and for inspection of land and maintenance of facilities; second, a limited case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case appeals process; and third, a continuation of some specific powers and immunities currently contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991 including to allow for all facilities legally installed under that regime to continue to be exempt from State and Territory laws and to allow individual subscribers to be connected to networks existing as at 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case appeals process would be to an independent panel. An appeal will only be open to carriers in limited circumstances: where negotiations with the relevant authorities or owners have broken down; the facility is an important part of a network of national significance; the construction of a substantial part of that network has been approved by relevant authorities or already installed; and the advantages to the national economy from the operation of the network to which the facility belongs outweighs any associated degradation of environmental amenity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The panel will comprise the Chairman of the ACA and up to four specially appointed associate members.

In relation to broadband aerial cabling, construction must be completed by 30 September 1997 and construction of other types of telecommunications infrastructure must be completed before 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill continues and reinforces the provisions in the 1991 act which prevent the law of a State or Territory from operating so as to discriminate against a carrier or a class of carrier. It provides that a State or Territory law has no effect to the extent that it discriminates, or has the effect of discriminating, either directly or indirectly against a carrier or a user or potential user of a carrier's services.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a critical component of the package of legislation introduced to establish a new regulatory framework that will provide for a more competitive telecommunications industry from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains key competition&hyphen;related provisions that complement the broader regulatory arrangements, including in relation to consumer protection, contained in the Telecommunications Bill 1996. It will bring the regulation of competition in the telecommunications industry more closely into line with general trade practices law and incorporate telecommunications industry&hyphen;specific rules on competition into the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA). The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will be responsible for administering these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications legislative package will remove regulatory barriers to market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="946"> entry, as well as a number of artificial regulatory distinctions, such as between mobile and fixed services. The reforms within this package will give all industry operators, both existing and new, the freedom to pursue the business strategy they choose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an open market, all carriers and service providers, including Telstra, must be given the flexibility to engage in normal competitive conduct&mdash;Australian consumers will not benefit from regulation that unnecessarily hampers the ability of operators to respond to the market. Therefore, the approach adopted in this bill is not as interventionist as the anti&hyphen;discrimination prohibitions in the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That said, there remain good reasons for there to continue to be industry&hyphen;specific competition regulation for telecommunications. The removal of regulatory barriers to entry does not automatically result in the appearance of normal competitive market structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra continues to wield significant market power derived primarily from its historical monopoly position. There is also scope for incumbent operators generally to engage in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct because competitors in downstream markets depend on access to the carriage services controlled by them. The possibility, for example, of incumbents engaging in anti&hyphen;competitive cross&hyphen;subsidy practices could threaten the further development of a competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All members of the telecommunications industry will be fully subject to general trade practices law contained in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act. The exemption from Part IV given to carriers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 for the supply of basic carriage services will not be continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Total reliance on Part IV of the TPA to constrain anti&hyphen;competitive conduct might, in some cases, prove ineffective given the still developing state of competition in the telecommunications industry. The fast pace of change and complex nature of horizontal and vertical arrangements of firms operating in this industry mean that any anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour could cause rapid damage to the competition that has already developed and severely hamper new entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, as well as Part IV of the act applying fully to telecommunications, the amendments made by this bill will supplement Part IV by increasing the ability of the ACCC to respond swiftly where anti&hyphen;competitive conduct is evident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important feature of the telecommunications industry is that competitors inevitably must make use of each others' networks. This is because many communications services (for example, telephone calls) require `any&hyphen;to&hyphen;any' connectivity&mdash;the ability for any end&hyphen;user of the service to contact 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any other end&hyphen;user, regardless of who the suppliers are or on what network they are connected. This `any&hyphen;to&hyphen;any' feature&mdash;and the Government's commitment to promote the diversity of carriage and content services available to end users&mdash;requires an access regime that includes additional features to those contained in the general access regime in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the Government recognises that there are expectations of continuity regarding the broad rights contained in existing access arrangements in Part 8 of the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons, the Government's philosophy in preparing the telecommunications access regime has been to follow an approach based on Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act as far as practicable, but nevertheless to introduce some additional refinements to ensure that the arrangements will work effectively for the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A smooth introduction of the new access regime depends critically on transitional arrangements. Transitional arrangements contained in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will essentially retain existing access rights for carriers, extend those rights to service providers and fulfil the Government's election commitment to achieve open access in regard to the carriage of broadcasting services over cable networks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to the key provisions of this bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anti&hyphen;competitive conduct</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill inserts a new Part XIB into the Trade Practices Act establishing a number of additional powers for the ACCC to deal with anti&hyphen;competitive conduct in telecommunications markets and to collect information to assist it in monitoring competition in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Part establishes a `competition rule' that a carrier or carriage service provider must not engage in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct. Conduct is considered to be anti&hyphen;competitive in two circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first circumstance relies on an effects&hyphen;based test, in recognition that damage can be inflicted on competition regardless of the purpose motivating that behaviour. In an industry where competition is in many areas still in its developmental stages, requiring proof of purpose may unduly delay regulatory action to stop anti&hyphen;competitive conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second circumstance is where a carrier or carriage service provider is in contravention of certain provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act (sections 45, 45B, 46, 47 and 48).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anti&hyphen;competitive conduct as defined in Part XIB is in wider terms than under existing Part IV provisions. The possibility of pecuniary penalties and private rights to seek injunctions in regard to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="947"> conduct or claim damages is therefore limited to conduct in relation to which the ACCC has taken specific action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court at any time for an injunction to stop anti&hyphen;competitive conduct, but will also be able to issue a competition notice stating that a carrier or carriage service provider has engaged in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a competition notice remains in force:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court for substantial pecuniary penalties in relation to further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice (the Court may also make ancillary orders, including orders requiring the disclosure of information, and/or the publication of advertisements); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">other persons will be able to seek an injunction to restrain or otherwise deal with further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice or, if they suffer loss or damage as a result of any further conduct, to take action to recover the amount of the loss or damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A competition notice will also be prima facie evidence of the matters in the notice for the purpose of any proceeding taken in relation to the notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the new legislative arrangements will introduce some level of uncertainty until regulators and the industry develop a clear understanding of its operation, the ACCC will be required to formulate guidelines before 1 July 1997 for use in deciding whether to issue a competition notice. Furthermore, a carrier or carriage service provider proposing to engage in a course of conduct will be able to seek an order from the ACCC to have that conduct exempted from the scope of the competition rule because it will result in a net benefit to the public or where the ACCC is satisfied that the conduct is not anti&hyphen;competitive conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCC will need strong information&hyphen;gathering powers to enable it to effectively administer competition regulation in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its power to direct carriers and carriage service providers with a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications market to file tariff information will allow the ACCC to examine carrier and carriage service provider conduct in telecommunications markets, including where it has concerns about potential anti&hyphen;competitive conduct but an insufficient basis on which to decide whether to take action under the competition notice provisions. Particular items of information submitted under a tariff filing direction would be publicly released where this would have a net public benefit. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCC will also be empowered to make record&hyphen;keeping rules with which specified carriers and carriage service providers will be required to comply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not want to see its policy of establishing a fully competitive telecommunications industry thwarted because of lack of, or the existence of inappropriate, regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the ACCC will be required to review and report annually on competitive safeguards within the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that competition rules for telecommunications will eventually be aligned, to the fullest extent practicable, with general trade practices law. The legislation provides that a review of the operation of these arrangements be undertaken before 1 July 2000. In conducting this review, consideration will be given to whether any or all of the provisions of Part XIB should be repealed or amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The telecommunications access regime in Part XIC provides foundation access rights to all industry operators and establishes a framework within which the industry can develop additional arrangements to improve the efficiency with which access is supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no logic in retaining blanket distinctions between the access rights of carriers and service providers in a market with open entry. It is likely that some future service provider operations will dwarf niche market carriers and legitimately require access at levels equal to that provided to large carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The access regime provides for regulated access rights to be established for specific carriage services and related services, and provides a framework within which the terms and conditions of access can be determined. It will reduce the power of those owning or controlling important infrastructure or services which are necessary for competitive services to be supplied to end&hyphen;users. In doing so, judgments by new and existing operators about whether to build their own networks or buy capacity on existing networks will be driven by normal commercial factors&mdash;decisions to build will only be taken where commercial considerations clearly favour this strategy. The regime will therefore promote the efficient use of and investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a clear policy intention that, as much as possible, both the determination of access rights and terms and conditions of access be the result of commercial processes and industry self&hyphen;regulation. The bill provides for the establishment of a Telecommunications Access Forum (TAF), a body open to all carriers and carriage service providers, to manage those matters. The Government expects the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="948"> industry as a whole to work constructively to develop industry&hyphen;driven solutions to access issues which reflect the legitimate interests of those seeking access and those under access obligations, and which operate in the long&hyphen;term interests of end&hyphen;users of telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government wants the benefits of increased competition to flow as soon as possible. It wants all service providers to be placed in the position of having foundation access rights equal to those currently enjoyed by the carriers. Transitional arrangements included in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will provide that services supplied between the existing carriers will, unless they would not promote the objects of the access regime, be declared services under this new access regime. In addition, the ACCC is required to declare a carriage service to bring within this access regime the supply of broadcasting services over cable networks. This fulfils our election commitment to remove the exemption of pay television carriage from the access regime given by the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not intend to allow any industry participants to avoid legitimate access requirements through artificial arrangements. Furthermore, service providers now have the ability to control services to which regulated access is appropriate and this will increase in the future. Therefore, the declaration of a service would create access obligations regardless of who the supplier is. At the request of an access seeker, an access provider must supply the declared service, interconnection and associated services, unless complying with the request would prevent the provider meeting the reasonable requirements of existing users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the Government recognises that exemptions from some or all of the standard access obligations for particular access providers or classes of access providers may be desirable. A provision allows the ACCC to give such exemptions where it would promote the long&hyphen;term interests of end&hyphen;users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access providers must comply with their access obligations on terms and conditions which may be determined in three alternative ways: as commercially agreed by the access provider and access seeker; as detailed in an access undertaking; or as determined by the ACCC through arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial negotiations are a matter for the parties and, in the absence of a dispute, the regime does not interfere with these processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be encouraging the TAF to develop an access code setting out model terms and conditions for complying with the standard access obligations which are capable of being voluntarily adopted in an undertaking. This access code 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism provides the industry with a very valuable tool to achieve efficiencies in the manner in which access is provided where general agreement can be reached. The Government expects that the code development work will initially focus on traditional telephony services and, over time, broaden to address other services. The Government expects that there will be little need for the ACCC to use its safeguard power to determine a code because the industry itself will develop satisfactory model terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also be encouraging the larger access providers to submit an access undertaking for ACCC acceptance. This would both improve the certainty surrounding the terms and conditions on which those persons must comply with the access obligations and provide increased certainty for access seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access undertakings, which would determine the terms and conditions of access to which the undertaking relates, may either adopt model terms and conditions in an access code, or seek to establish specific terms and conditions. Public consultation is an important requirement before an industry access code can be approved or an undertaking that does not adopt the code can be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an access undertaking does not address a matter about access and commercial negotiation processes have failed, either party to the negotiations may notify the ACCC that a dispute exists and seek a determination on the matter. Arbitration processes broadly reflect the parallel provisions contained in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. These provisions would not, however, prevent the industry itself establishing its own arbitration arrangements, but provides a bedrock right of ACCC arbitration to all parties should it be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet concerns about a party to a dispute failing to negotiate in good faith, the bill gives the ACCC the power to give procedural directions to the party to facilitate a resumption of those negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an industry where there are often substantial differences between the market power of an access seeker and access provider, concluding commercial negotiations will often be difficult. The access regime provides the necessary tools for the industry itself to develop broad solutions to access issues, but also, where necessary, for the regulator to intervene. However, if parties to negotiations are broadly aware of the outcome the regulatory regime may impose, they are more likely to be capable of reaching agreement independently. Therefore, there is scope for broad guidance to be provided by the regulator and Government in order to facilitate commercial processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access pricing issues is one area where disputes may often arise. Accordingly, Part XIC will enable the Minister to make a determination regarding the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="949"> principles to be applied in determining price&hyphen;related terms and conditions. Access undertakings, access codes and determinations made under the arbitration provisions must be consistent with any such determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the power to determine pricing principles will provide a useful mechanism to give guidance to the industry, the preferred approach is to rely, as far as possible, on the broader regulatory regime and ongoing guidance from the ACCC as the regulator. The Government will monitor the implementation of the regime in determining whether to exercise this power.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996 provides for the calculation of the universal service levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy is designed to recover from carriers the losses that result from supplying loss&hyphen;making services in the course of fulfilling the USO. The total net cost of supplying those services will depend on all carriers with a USO identifying loss&hyphen;making areas and the extent of losses in those areas. Total losses may vary from year to year according to a range of factors including demand, new investment, traffic levels, changes to the definition of the USO and the cost of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relative contributions of participating carriers will depend on the total net universal service cost and each carrier's share of total eligible revenue. The share provides the basis on which total costs are apportioned to each carrier. Thus a carrier earning 50 per cent of total eligible revenue would be liable to fund 50 per cent of the total net universal service cost. Deducted from a carrier's total contribution (known as its "levy debit") are the amounts it has already expended in fulfilling its USO. The actual levy imposed on, and payable by, a carrier is therefore the amount by which the carrier's contribution exceeds what it has already expended as a universal service carrier (ie. its "levy debit balance"). Where a universal service carrier's expenditure in fulfilling the USO exceeds its contribution requirement, it has a levy credit balance and is entitled to receive a payment from the levy that is collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the number of variables that are involved, both in terms of universal service costs and carrier revenue shares, the amounts that will be payable under the levy cannot be quantified. Historical figures give some idea of the costs that have been

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996 seeks to amend the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to facilitate increased competition in telecommunications and deals with a number of other matters to improve mechanisms for the management of the radiofrequency spectrum. The Radiocommunications Act 1992 provides for this management which includes: planning the use of the spectrum; allocating and issuing licences; making technical standards; and enforcing compliance with the act and subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of radiocommunications&hyphen;based technologies to deliver communications services is increasing. Timely access to radiofrequency spectrum is essential for the rapid development of competition in telecommunications, with flow&hyphen;on benefits for the Australian economy and consumers. The development of further competition in telecommunications is the principal objective of the post 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="955"> 1997 telecommunications regulatory reforms. The amendments proposed in the bill complement amendments proposed in related telecommunications legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, in essence, the amendments provide for: sale of spectrum while encumbered and later clearance of incumbent users; application of section 50 and other related sections of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the allocation and issuing of radiocommunications licences; a Ministerial power to limit the amount of spectrum persons can acquire at price&hyphen;based allocations; extending the period of spectrum licences to a maximum of fifteen years; implementation of electromagnetic compatibility requirements; the setting of radiocommunications standards for health and safety purposes; and the removal of provisions for technical licence specifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the details of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current legislative arrangements require that before a radiofrequency band is re&hyphen;allocated to apparatus or spectrum licences for new uses, the band must be cleared of all incumbents or, in the case of spectrum licences, the apparatus licences must be converted to spectrum licences by a difficult process that could result in the spectrum being unsuitable for some purposes. This can defeat the purpose of re&hyphen;allocating spectrum for efficient and beneficial uses. The clearance&hyphen;then&hyphen;sale process takes an extended period of time&mdash;up to 10 years in some cases&mdash;and can leave spectrum under&hyphen;utilised for many years. It can also lead to unnecessary, costly clearance of spectrum if the allocation process shows demand for access to the cleared band is less than anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even when spectrum has been allocated, there could be a period when it is not fully used, for example, while equipment is ordered, delivered and installed or while the demand for the services grows to the extent that all the spectrum is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Selling spectrum while encumbered will allow early allocation to the new owner, who can undertake planning while the rights of the incumbents are protected. Under the proposed system of re&hyphen;allocation declarations, incumbents receive at least two years notice of the need to vacate spectrum. The actual period will depend on the circumstances, including the extent of any previous forewarning of incumbents by planning processes and the urgency of the need for the spectrum for new uses. Incumbents will also have the opportunity to buy at auction the spectrum they are operating in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the clearance date, incumbents can also remain if commercial terms are agreed with the new owner. Some incumbents may be able to continue operating their transmitters and receivers without any changes. Others may need to make 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some changes, however, they may not need to re&hyphen;site or substantially alter equipment. For example, they could be in a position to make frequency adjustments to their equipment to continue operation in other bands or in the same band but in a position that is more convenient for the holder of the new licence. All in all, the proposed amendments will offer incumbents a range of options for continuing access to radiofrequency spectrum while making the spectrum available for new uses in a timely manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, spectrum licences may be issued for fixed terms up to ten years. This term is proposed to be extended to a maximum of fifteen years to provide greater certainty and opportunity for return on investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A ten year spectrum licence term was not considered by industry to be long enough to offer an attractive investment. A licence term of up to fifteen years should enhance potential participants' confidence to commit to substantial financial investment in communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA) currently applies to radiocommunications licences after they are issued, but not to the initial allocation and licence issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment would apply section 50 of the TPA to the licence issue process and to the use of spectrum under an authorisation given by a licensee to third parties. This closes gaps in regulatory coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposing the creation of a Ministerial power to set limits which would apply during a licence allocation process supplements the competition protection functions under the TPA. This would allow the Minister to consider and, if necessary, set pro&hyphen;competitive limits to provide some opportunity for new entrants to purchase spectrum licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) framework sets emission limits on devices capable of causing interference and specifies levels of immunity to emissions of electrical and electronic equipment supplied in Australia. Currently, the EMC framework applies to radiocommunications devices that are defined as such under the act, but has limited support in applying to other non&hyphen;radiocommunications devices which could cause, or be subject to, interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments would support the Spectrum Management Agency's EMC standards&hyphen;making power with respect to a range of devices including computers, navigation equipment, industrial equipment such as arc welding equipment and power tools, and spark ignition engines. Many of these devices have long histories of either causing interference to other devices or being susceptible to interference from other devices. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="956">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are consistent with the SMA's responsibility for implementing and administering the EMC framework and for minimising the effects of interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed extension of the SMA's standards making powers to include protection of the health and safety of persons who operate, work on or use radiocommunications transmitters or receivers, or are reasonably likely to be affected by their operation, enables the SMA to enforce compliance of radiocommunications devices, receivers and transmitters with such standards. It also harmonises radiocommunications legislation with telecommunications legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA is to continue arrangements with suitably qualified bodies, such as Standards Australia, for the development of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical licence specifications in the act duplicate other technical regulatory powers of the SMA, notably the ability to set licence conditions, and lead to confusion as to which power should be used. The removal of these provisions will eliminate the confusion without materially affecting the SMA's powers in relation to technical regulation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. Senator Brown, thank you for those very helpful remarks. It was time that someone put you out of your agony; it was good of Senator Margetts to come in. As I understand it&mdash;I hope this reflects the understanding of other senators&mdash;we seem to have debated pretty fully amendment Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6. If you look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  you will see that there have been a lot of exchanges. I think the government has had a chance to put its views and to respond in detail, although not always to the satisfaction of Senator Margetts. Nonetheless there has been some extensive debate on those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where we now stand is that a response is required to some questions that have been raised by Senator Cook which I think essentially relate to amendment Nos 2 and 4. We will co-operate, as we always do, with the chamber; but it seems to me that it would make sense if we could move amendment Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, take a vote on them and then deal with the final amendments before the chamber&mdash;Nos 2 and 4.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister, but the minister is perhaps assuming that we have actually progressed further than we have. Part of that problem is that the last time we were here, we were left with a lot of questions and some half&hyphen;formed arguments. I think it is necessary to round those arguments more. What we got was a sort of two&hyphen;way process, with the minister saying, `Public interest is everything everyone could ever want it to be'&mdash;that is my paraphrase&mdash;and me indicating that public interest was a circular process, which basically defines it as being whatever the government decides it might be at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="957"> time. When government policies in relation to ecological sustainability aren't worth much chop, we have got no guarantee of public interest in relation to such things as trade practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we last debated this bill, the issue of public interest aroused hot debate&mdash;we know that. The Greens are concerned at the lack of attention given to the public interest in the context of the entire privatisation agenda. This bill is another example of the fundamental flaw in the new religion, which is competition policy. I have to say that the indications are that competition policy looks like it is going on the international agenda as being no longer a voluntary measure for countries to take. Australia has hopped in there, just like they stripped off tariffs. It has gone on the agenda for the World Trade Organisation to look at compulsory competition policy in the future. So all these areas&mdash;where we believe there are changes to intimate regulations and by&hyphen;laws at a local and state government level&mdash;are now on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. I feel sorry for those people who do not find that horrifying, because there are many things that are happening to them that they perhaps do not actually understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not adequately address our concerns about the public interest. A number of reasons for opposing our amendment were given. None of them were convincing. Some even contradicted each other. At one stage Senator Kemp complained that our amendments would wreck the government's efforts to streamline the process of approving access codes and turn it into a process oriented piece of legislation that would be very time consuming. Heaven forbid that the interests of the community should ever delay the profit making activities of corporations that might be supporting the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Senator, this issue is one which is of enormous importance to the Australian community. Surely it is better to spend a little more time getting it right, or trying to get it right, than to hastily make a big and costly mistake. Also during the committee stage of debate Senator Kemp made the following statement about the public interest:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just for clarification, it is perhaps worth mentioning how the public interest provisions of the Trade Practices Act operate. In the act, public interest must be considered when the ACCC is examining an application for authorisation and when the ACCC is examining an access undertaking. The act provides that when performing these functions the ACCC must publish the application and call for public submissions. Similarly, the amendments in the bill provide that the ACCC, before attempting an access code, must engage in public consultation. I think that perhaps goes a little way to addressing some of the issues Senator Margetts raised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No, Senator Kemp, it does not. To take the first point, Senator Kemp says that under the Trade Practices Act the ACCC must consider the public interest. This sounds like an answer to my concerns; it is not, because the Trade Practices Act does not define what the public interest is. All that exists are rulings by the old Trade Practices Commission on things which could constitute public benefits. `Public benefits' are not necessarily the same as `public interest'. The most detailed of these rulings was in a 1991 case Re ACI Operations Pty. Ltd. Fourteen points were listed, the last being a rather vague statement: `Steps to protect the environment'. That is probably a little better than government policy on ecological sustainability when you have not got one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not good enough. I am not happy that an unelected body such as the Trade Practices Commission or its successor, the hugely powerful ACCC, decides what constitutes public interest. Surely that should be the task of an elected body such as parliament. We should be defining the public interest and, should I say, protecting it. We are elected representatives of the Australian people. Leaving the ACCC to operate within that framework is bizarre. To allow the ACCC to decide what the public interest is to completely abrogate our responsibility as elected representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the 14 points of public benefit, which I say is not the same as public interest, are overwhelmingly informed by the ideological belief that what is good for business is good for the public. The more efficient the economy, the happier the public. It ignores the many other non&hyphen;monetary issues that affect the public good that make up what we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="958"> call the public interest. That is why the Greens are so concerned to see that public interest is better defined in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to our amendments were also contradictory. On the one hand the government and the ALP were complaining that we should not be defining public interest to the extent that we sought to in our amendment. The ALP protested that it was overly prescriptive. However, in one of his responses to me the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) told me that competition principles require governments to take into account a list of public interest matters when undertaking a review of regulations. The list includes policies relating to ecologically sustainable development, social welfare and equity considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very similar to our amendment. I wonder, if you really believe that that is covered in the ACCC, why you have so much problem with our amendment. The reason is that it is not covered because all it refers to is your policies on ecological sustainability, which are close to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue I would like to address and it is part of the national competition policy implementation agreement. All states and territories were required to prepare a schedule for review of all legislative restrictions on competition. I have with me the schedule prepared by the Queensland government. It goes through Queensland's legislation and identifies measures that restrict competition. This, of course, must be a bad thing&mdash;anything that restricts competition should be a bad thing, according to this. When you look at specific examples of what they consider to be measures that restrict competition, you see they are frequently things which are considered benefits to members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example is licensing or registration requirements. That is explained as a practice which limits participation in industry to those persons or bodies that meet defined standards, qualifications or training. I can imagine there are lots of times when you really should have those kinds of requirements. This may be something that restricts competition, but it is also a very good thing indeed that this requirement exists. I am sure most people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be reassured to know that such standards are enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of anti&hyphen;competitive practice is business conduct restrictions. What are these? The Queensland Heritage Act 1992 apparently has sections which qualify as business conduct restrictions, and an example given is that Heritage Council approval is required before any development is allowed on heritage registered properties. Gosh, this must be a restriction on business, and this is what seems to be included. This is not a business conduct restriction; it is an appropriate regulation of activities which may damage properties which are part of Queensland cultural heritage. To term this as business restriction is truly the height of economic fundamentalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other examples which are worth quoting, and one of them is from the Child Care Act 1991, which regulates child-care centres. This, according to the review, is guilty of restricting competition in a number of ways. The bill prescribes matters such as qualifications of child&hyphen;care personnel. How outrageous! It sets out building and physical environment standards and food safety standards. Appalling! Senators, as the final indignity to competitive practice, the operation of child&hyphen;care facilities is prohibited in certain locations&mdash;that is, premises adjacent to a place where flammable materials or dangerous chemicals are manufactured or stored. So it is a restriction on business practice to not be allowed to put a child&hyphen;care facility next to a chemical waste dump. How awful!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is clear from reading this document is that in many cases the push to increase competition involves dismantling regulations and practises which protect and promote the public interest. To put it bluntly, competition policy can frequently be against the public interest. How obscene it is to even consider the idea of relaxing regulations on child&hyphen;care facilities because they are restrictive of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From reading this document, one also gets the feeling that competition policy, far from giving due weight to the public interest, may be used to undermine existing legislation in areas relating to the public interest such as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="959"> environmental protection. As an example, the review of the Nature Conservation Act 1992 finishes with this rather chilling statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to any national competition policy review commencing, further consideration is required to identify whether there are any restrictions in the various species conservation plans in place at that time that go beyond what is required for legitimate, natural resource management purposes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So perhaps we will have the ACCC deciding on what is a legitimate resource management purpose. This is a time bomb we are looking at, a ticking time bomb which by 1998 will go off. In what way will it go off? Every single piece of legislation which does not conform to competition policy, which does not have a specific exemption, will somehow be made subject to competition policy. Therefore, be afraid, be very afraid. That is why, if we do not know what public interest is now, if we think somehow it will be all right on the night, we are deluding ourselves and we are deluding the people we have been set up to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude this particular explanation by restating the point that I made in my second reading speech: the overriding concern of legislation which affects essential infrastructure such as electricity and water should be in the public interest. If competition serves the public interest, so be it, but it should not be taken as a given and it should be recognised that in some cases competition is against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, like so many that are increasing competition in the Australian economy, does not give due regard to public interest considerations and, indeed, explicitly equates competition with public interest. Our opposition to it remains, and I hope that some of these words have fallen on more fertile ears than we spoke to before in relation to the Labor Party because I believe that we all have responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it was the Labor Party that was involved with the competition legislation in 1995, and I know there is a level of embarrassment about that level of responsibility, but now is the time to face up to that responsibility and look at what we are doing to the future decisions that are going to be made that affect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people on a very real level&mdash;the provision of electricity, the provision of water resources and heaven knows what else in the future. So I commend my amendments to the Senate and urge their support from my Senate colleagues.</PARA></SPEECH>

You keep on reiterating that public interest equals competition. No-one has said that but you. I do not know what I can do to turn you away from that simplistic concept. I think I can respond constructively to some of the remarks made in this chamber. People are waiting to see how I respond to Senator Cook. I shall, therefore, return to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will summarise. Senator Cook asked me to provide details about the document in which the ACCC sets out its approach to public interest in the access context. The document is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access undertakings: a draft guide to access undertakings under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act</EMPHASIS>. It was released by the ACCC in December 1996. For the information of senators, I table an extract from that document. The extract is entitled `What is the Public Interest?'. I can only urge Senator Margetts, before she gets up and talks again on this matter, to read this document so that we do not constantly go over the same arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document draws from the ACCC's longstanding approach to public benefit in relation to authorisations, which is set out in a determination of its predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission, entitled `ACI Operations Pty Limited'. The reference to that determination is (1991) ATRP(Comm) 50-108.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook referred to a new section 44ZZAA(3)(d), which is set out in the bill. This provision states that, in deciding whether to accept an access code, the ACCC must have regard to matters specified in the regulations. Senator Cook asked whether the government would agree to including in the regulations a reference to particular public interest issues found in the intergovernmental competition principles agreement. Clause 1(3) of the agreement sets out a list of factors which governments must consider where they are relevant to their public interest decisions on particular competition issues. I will not re&hyphen;read them into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but they are quite extensive and include social welfare and equity considerations and issues relating to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform Senator Cook, Senator Harradine, who has expressed interest in this matter, and Senator Margetts that the government sees no difficulty with the inclusion of those list of factors in the regulations for the purposes of the proposed section 44ZZAA(3)(d). That should put to bed, I hope, the concerns that Senator Margetts constantly runs that public interest equals competition. </PARA>

We can all think of examples, and I have given three in relation to what are being called `potential restrictions to business competition,' which in fact may involve the prevention of harm.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the point that was made by Senator Margetts about policy. As the committee will remember, I did raise this question on the last occasion. I do not intend to canvass it further. I was grateful to receive a letter from Senator Kemp dated 5 February which detailed an explanation of this question of public interest. The letter stated, inter alia, that consideration of public interest is an integral aspect of the policy. Both the Trade Practices Act and the intergovernmental competition principles agreement contain public interest tests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter goes on to say what those tests are. It speaks about a review of regulation and gives a list of public interest matters.

The letter says that governments are required to consider these issues and not focus narrowly on competition issues and that, moreover, any changes to Commonwealth legislation will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

However, the amendments in items 2 and 4 go to the extent not of restricting the definition of public interest but of particularising elements which we, as the Australian Democrats, think are appropriate and deserving of support.

It says `government legislation and policies' for two areas: for ecologically sustainable development and for policies relating to matters such as occupational health and safety. Anybody who was in the chamber during the recent debate on the industrial relations legislation and heard about what has happened to occupational health and safety should be concerned about what this now says are public interest matters and about government legislation and policies relating to access and equity. If this government does not have particular policies relating to access and equity, and if its legislation is such that it will change them over time, then what we are left with&mdash;as far as guarantee of public interest over such things as access and equity is concerned&mdash;is whatever the government decides is access and equity.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This package of bills was designed to achieve several of the government's important policy initiatives in the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio that were outlined when these bills were introduced in this house on 5 February 1997. Since then there has been further consideration of the measures contained in these bills. It may assist honourable senators, in dealing with this legislation, if I could outline the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context that regulations in this area were disallowed by the Senate last year, the government has decided not to proceed at this time with its planned changes to the existing English education charge. The government will thus not proceed with the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill. As a result, minor amendments are needed to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) to ensure that people who apply for permanent visas after the introduction of the visa application charge will only pay the new charge, and that people who are already liable to pay the existing English education charge will not have to pay the visa application charge. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="967">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also undertakes that the component of the visa application charge that relates to English language proficiency is fixed in the regulations at the same amount as would be paid by a similar person under the existing English education charge arrangements. In all cases, the level of charge payable with respect to English language tuition will continue at existing levels. This includes any existing concessional rates of charge. However, the government continues to believe that these measures are moderate and appropriate and it will continue to seek support from the Senate for relevant regulations at an appropriate time. Honourable senators will recall that the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs commented on the amendments proposed in schedule 3 of the bill relating to marital status and the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was concern in the committee that schedule 3 amendments could permit or require sexual discrimination in relation to the marital status of persons dealing with applications from persons in de facto relationships. While the government would never contemplate such provisions, we are happy to propose an amendment to schedule 3 to remove any doubt in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of consideration has been the government's intention to require a mandatory period of cohabitation for people seeking visas on the basis of de facto and interdependent relationships. Honourable senators can be assured that the government intends that the period of cohabitation that will be required under the regulations in de facto and interdependency cases will not exceed 12 months, and that there will be provision to waive this requirement if there are compelling circumstances to do so. For example, and without intending to be prescriptive about the content of future regulations, the regulations might make provision for waiver of the cohabitation period where a de facto couple has a child of the relationship or where cohabitation by interdependent applicants is contrary to the law of the country in which they reside. I trust that this information will assist honourable senators in their consideration of the bills.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested to know whether any attempt has been made to brief other interested parties on this change which Senator Kemp just read so expertly&mdash;but rather quickly, I might add&mdash;to us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I would like some assurance from the minister that the opposition spokesperson has been briefed and apprised of this move.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the sort of chaos that reigns when, as Senator Harradine said, a measure is lobbed on the Senate without the government having informed the Senate that it was coming. The Senate was to deal, as we understood it, with three bills which affect people coming into the country&mdash;the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I said that, so far as I was aware, I was not informed; I am happy to stand corrected on that. But, again, this move requires some shift of thought. The bills that we have before us now&mdash;that is, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill&mdash;go beyond the issue of immigration intake. Certainly, the debate that we have had many times in this place has been the simple issue of numbers and the intake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the Democrats believe that as a nation we have a sovereign right to determine the total level of immigration in this country. We also have a sovereign responsibility, which is clearly annunciated in the Australian Democrats policy, of which there exist three pillars. I note that in previous debates members on different sides of this chamber have enjoyed referring to Democrats policy but have not necessarily told the whole story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a responsibility to balance the sometimes competing demands of the environment with social justice and a sustainable sovereign economy. We believe the bills before us today represent another failure to deliver coalition policy. A cursory reading of the coalition's election policy tells us, `The family is the foundation of our society and must be the core of immigration and settlement policy.' We also read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common language is the glue of a cohesive nation. It is important that all Australians, wherever possible, can speak English adequately.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality of this legislation is quite different. By attempting to limit the number of visas that can be granted to spouses, aged parents and dependent children, the government is going in a direction which we would describe as anti-family and one that fails to take into account&mdash;into valuable consideration&mdash;the familial and relationship ties of Australian citizens and permanent Australian residents alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that migrants in the independent category, the more economic category, are somehow more valuable to Australia. Do not independent immigrants have families? Of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course they do, and they will have the legitimate expectation that they will be able to reunite with them at some later stage. To a great extent, the government's arguments in this regard have become circular and are lacking in substance. There could be nothing more abhorrent than an immigration policy that says to the Australian citizens, `No, you may not marry the person of your choice.' As the shadow minister for immigration, Mr Duncan Kerr, in the other chamber on 2 December last year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let there be no mistake that the issue of capping the spouse visa is not one about immigration per se. It is to do with the violation of the right of every red&hyphen;blooded Australian, whether that Australian has been a citizen for a day or six generations or whether that person is of Chinese, Greek, Vietnamese, Lebanese, African or English descent. If this legislation is passed by the parliament, it will mean that the right of any Australian to choose to marry the love of his or her life will be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, I understand that this used to be the thinking of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). On 1 June 1989, when he was the shadow minister, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, we have before us today evidence that the minister does not find it absolutely unconscionable and that he indeed was not glad at all that the minister had made the decision to exclude those groups. The Democrats argue very strongly that this is a duplicity of a bad kind being performed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have information that the Labor Party intends to support schedule 3 of this bill, and I am happy to stand corrected on that if that is no longer the case. Clearly, they no longer believe it to be the right of every Australian to share their lives with the love of his or her life, either. Such duplicity! I will address that key issue in one moment. I hope that I stand to be corrected on that issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="970">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, however, do believe that it is unconscionable for a government to have that power over Australian citizens and permanent residents. Unlike the minister&mdash;and, it appears, the Labor Party as well&mdash;we have not altered our position in that regard. It is a position that has strongly been debated in this chamber previously and one which was strongly annunciated by ex&hyphen;Senator Sid Spindler on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) will again want to discuss the Australian Democrats' immigration policy in this place, perhaps in a thinly veiled&mdash;or not so thinly veiled&mdash;attempt to discredit our stance on this matter. We find it somewhat amusing, as we have in previous debates, that when Senator Vanstone refers to these issues and uses the Democrats policy to try to justify the government's intent, claiming that her policy is a lesser version of the Democrats policy, she in fact uses only selective parts of the Democrats policy. Let me assure the government and the minister, if she were here, that the one way to discredit its own policy is to read only part of a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the government has demonstrated a profound ignorance of the important issues in this matter by attempting to score rather cheap political points, as it certainly did in the last debate on immigration policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am switching hats at the moment and am speaking as the education spokesperson for the Australian Democrats. I refer to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs report before us. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In fact, it is the higher education funding report for the 1997-99 triennium. Even after a brief glance at this report, I have to dispute some of its claims. Page 1 of the overview, section 2.2, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's funding package for higher education for years 1997-99 is both fiscally responsible and sensitive to the educational objectives and the planning horizons of the education sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If only it was. Of course, as we saw in this chamber today when we were debating the role of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and the administration of her department, we realised that the higher education sector has undergone some of the most radical and profound changes that higher education has ever experienced in this country, with operating grants cuts and overall cuts in the magnitude of $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suggest for a minute that those cuts have been handled in a fiscally responsible or educationally sensitive manner&mdash;in fact, quite the contrary. I think that most of the experts or those in the know in the higher education sector, whether vice&hyphen;chancellors, academics, the National Tertiary Education Union or, in fact, students in their representative organisation, the National Union of Students, would argue very strongly that we have seen quite regressive changes made to the higher education sector over the last few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report refers to some of those changes. Section 2.1 refers to operating grants. Again, this report seems to argue that the operating grants have been cut in a way that has given universities the time to plan and adapt and there will still be a net increase in funds for 1997. Again, I dispute the claims in this report. Many institutions first learnt of the cuts when they were mooted by the minister midyear last year and they were executed towards the end of last year, not giving institutions that much time to adapt because, as many of us would know, institutions in the higher education sector plan years in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the operation of faculties, courses or departments, many of those institutions had printed up their enrolment and other information many months before the budget changes were passed. Also, this report notes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="971"> that the government's objective is to maintain undergraduate loads. The point that we should always remember is that this has been at the expense of postgraduate loads. It is very sad to see that the emphasis on not only teaching but research has been somewhat diminished under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report refers to other changes, as noted in section 2.13 which refers to opening up new areas for universities to gain revenue from diverse sources. That almost sounds like it is a really good and exciting thing for institutions when, in fact, institutions will be compensating for the massive cuts they have endured by introducing such regressive things as up&hyphen;front and full&hyphen;cost fees. As I mentioned in my speech today, University of Melbourne has set the benchmark with a $110,000 course for dentistry. I again ask the minister in this place, `How many poor kids are going to pay $110,000 so they can have a dentistry degree?' It is very sad that what this report does not reflect is that your ability to pay now determines your ability to study in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 9, under the heading `A fair balance between public and private funding', this report in section 2.17 refers to changes to the higher education contribution scheme. As many of us would know, the HECS charges which were around $2,300 per annum have now been hugely increased. The humanities and various other courses now have a huge HECS debt of $3,300 per year. In relation to sciences, everybody would be aware of the reductions in science enrolments both at secondary school level and in higher education institutions. I am sure we all lament that but it did not stop the government putting a $4,700 fee per annum on courses such as science, maths, computing, engineering, processing and health sciences&mdash;all areas which, I might add, have experienced a reduction in enrolment applications this year. Law tops the list along with medicine at $5,500 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are certainly not sensitive or fiscally responsible measures; they are measures promoted by government which is keen only on cost cutting and revenue raising. They are prepared to do it at the expense of not only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this generation but future generations. It is very sad that it is now your bank balance that counts and not your merit when it comes to pursuing education in this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tonight's adjournment debate I wish to take issue with the authors of an article that appeared in yesterday's issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  by the well&hyphen;known trio of euthanasia warriors: Singer, Kuhse and Baume, who allege that what I said to the Senate on 14 February 1997 was blatantly untrue. I wish to examine that assertion. The only example cited by the authors was my assertion that their study was not comparable to a Dutch survey with a similar subject matter. My claim is supported by a number of eminent ethicists who have undertaken a very persuasive critique of the survey undertaken by Kuhse and others. These eminent ethicists, including Dr John Fleming, the Director of the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute, conclude as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study has major methodological problems in the questionnaire formulation and the latter, through mistranslation, magnifies confusions that were present in the Netherlands study. The categories in the Kuhse et al survey mix decisions which are outside the law (except in the NT) with those in conformity with the law. The questions also mix decisions which are traditionally held to be morally acceptable with those that are not. The Kuhse study adopts an eccentric notion of intention that has no basis in existing law or traditional morality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, whilst I accept my interpretation and that of eminent ethicists may not be acceptable to Professors Kuhse, Singer and Baume, to allege I provided blatantly untrue material is the sort of hysterical outburst one expects from crusaders not dispassionate researchers. The eminent ethicists Tonti&hyphen;Fillipini, Fleming, Fisher and Krohn also make the telling point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apparent lack of objectivity and balance in the composition of the research team and the seemingly political nature of the project would not be lost on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="972"> those doctors completing the questionnaire and may well have skewed the result. This view would have been confirmed by the inclusion of the two questions about the effects of legal interference in regard to medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When this very proposition was put to Professors Baume and Kuhse by me at the Senate hearing we received responses which reflect on their intellectual integrity. Allow me to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How did you deal with the 36 per cent who did not respond? How did you factor that into your results, if at all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prof. Kuhse</EMPHASIS> &mdash;We did. We recorded that they did not respond. That is the problem with any survey.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I followed up by asking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I accept that. But don't you agree that the non&hyphen;respondents would be the most likely to be biased against the survey?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Kuhse responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I were an opponent of voluntary euthanasia I would have a strong incentive to fill in the questionnaire.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I then pointed out to Professor Kuhse as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . can I quote from an article by Professor Baume published in the Medical Journal of Australia volume 161, 18 July 1994:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in which Professor Baume wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The non&hyphen;respondents were less likely to agree that it is sometimes right for a doctor to take (active) steps to bring about a patient's death, as shown in Table 2."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Table 2 tells us those who responded `yes' from the respondents was 58 per cent but from the non&hyphen;respondents only 18.2 per cent&mdash;&hyphen; a vast difference, wouldn't you agree? Were you aware of Professor Baume's findings before you made that comment?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Her answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prof.Kuhse</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I should have been aware of those findings?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And further:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prof.Kuhse</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I reject the language of bias. What we have is a non&hyphen;response rate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact that Professor Kuhse, supposedly an expert as a result of 17 years study, was not aware of her co&hyphen;author's study of only three years ago published in the same journal, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> , is hard to accept. Professor Baume's failure to intervene to protect his own integrity and previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> study was noteworthy. His silence despite knowing of his own study has left a very bad taste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is really interesting and illuminating, indeed intriguing, is the comment by five academics for whom the article's authors, I am sure, have great regard. They commented as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all postal surveys are subject to some degree of non&hyphen;response bias.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Concentrate on the word `bias'. Allow me to emphasise: all postal surveys&mdash;not some but all&mdash;are subject to some degree of non&hyphen;response bias. So why this barefaced flat denial of a non&hyphen;response bias? Why the failure of Professor Baume to intervene?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who were these five academics who told us that all postal surveys are subject to some degree of non&hyphen;response bias? Guess who. None other than Helga Kuhse, Peter Singer, Peter Baume, Malcolm Clark and Maurice Rickard&mdash;the very authors of the article. They had it in their very own article, which they denied to the Senate committee on the night that they gave evidence in camera. And Professor Kuhse was the principal author. The in camera evidence has now been made public, Senator Collins. I note your frowning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I asked my questions I did not have a copy of the article. If I had had a copy, Professor Kuhse may have been required to answer somewhat differently from what she did. Should we believe Professor Kuhse's own article on bias or her verbal evidence that refutes her own writing and the findings of the co&hyphen;author of only three years ago of which she claims she was unaware? Professor Kuhse either hoped I had not done my research or was simply incompetent and failed to research her topic. On either count, her credibility has been irreparably shattered. Professor Baume's silence on the matter leaves his credibility in tatters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this highlights is that even people with `Professor' in front of their name can be ideologically motivated to the extent that their research becomes thinly veiled propaganda. A harsh criticism? Perhaps. But then why did the Australian Medical Association need to write to me on 19 February as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">published or discussed in the MJA article, however, are highly relevant to the current debate. I, therefore, draw to your attention the questions and subsequent responses provided by the researchers as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These results indicate that legalising euthanasia or physician&hyphen;assisted suicide is not likely to assist medical practitioners in their management of severely and terminally ill patients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Over 90 per cent of doctors do not see the need for a change in legislation; yet the campaign of Professor Kuhse and others is that there is a need for such legislation. But the answers to the AMA questions did not support their campaign, so they just refused to publish it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is Professor Kuhse's and Professor Baume's explanation for this glaring omission? Was Professor Kuhse unaware of the responses?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All honourable senators would be aware of the hysteria that has been whipped up around the country in recent months by conservative state premiers, in particular, about so-called judicial activism of the Hight Court and the question of native title following the High Court's decision in Wik. There have been a number of completely irrational suggestions made by prominent people, such as the Premier of Queensland. It has been suggested that the High Court has in some way impugned the sovereignty of parliament by doing its job in interpreting the law from time

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, my legal friends in Darwin say it has got much to commend it. It is not a particularly rational position to take. The suggestion that the High Court has in some way impugned the integrity of parliament is nonsense. The High Court has done its job&mdash;whether you agree with it or not&mdash;since federation. You could say&mdash;fairly, I guess&mdash;that from time to time the High Court, in interpreting law, has made things difficult for politicians; but there is not the slightest doubt that the sovereignty of our parliaments is still intact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is open to parliament at any time following decisions of courts to amend laws or to introduce new laws which clearly indicate to the courts what the view of the parliament is. We have been doing it for a long time in our Westminster system&mdash;hundreds of years, in fact. It is open to this parliament to do precisely that in respect of the Wik judgment. Of course, there are a number of politicians who find it politically disagreeable to have to bite that particular bullet, and I understand that. Nevertheless, to seriously suggest that the High Court has in some way contravened the sovereignty of parliament is a piece of factual nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all accept this as part of the cut and thrust of political debate in this country. But the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, has in my view gone one step too far. He launched a number of over the top, snide personal attacks on Aboriginal people generally across Australia through the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Gallarrwuy Yunupingu. The chief minister of the Northern Territory&mdash;I say this with great sorrow as a Territorian, fierce in my pride of being a Territorian&mdash;described Mr Yunupingu as `just another whingeing black'. He also then went on to use the privilege extended by the Northern Territory parliament to describe Gallarrwuy Yunupingu, in an utterly over the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> top description, as `an absolutely despicable person'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not hold any particular brief for Mr Yunupingu. The public record will show that over the years Gallarrwuy and I have had our disagreements publicly. But I point out to the Senate in passing that this is a man who became Australian of the Year. This is a man who, over the years, has raised a number of beautiful children. He is a good family man, a fundamentally decent person, an intelligent man. Because Gallarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of one of the most influential Aboriginal organisations in the country&mdash;for close on 20 years, almost as long as I have been in parliament, he has been involved in public life&mdash;takes a political position different from that of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, it is over the top to describe him as `an absolutely despicable person' and `just another whingeing black'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out in this parliament that many Territorians&mdash;no matter what their race, creed or colour&mdash;consider the Chief Minister's remarks to be highly offensive. They think rightly that this is just crass headline hunting and that it sullies the image of the Northern Territory, and I believe that they are right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make this point&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Abetz is in here&mdash;is that these intemperate remarks of the chief minister are hardly conducive to the process of reconciliation, even to just living together. His remarks come hot on the heels of what he called, just a few months before, all members of this federal parliament who disagreed with his views on euthanasia. Indeed, Senator Abetz would be included among them. Senator Abetz is supporting the Andrews bill, as he is entitled to do. The chief minister described all members of this federal parliament who intend to do that&mdash;those listeners who are of a sensitive nature, please cover your ears&mdash;as `bastards and bitches'. Again, that is hardly a remark that does the Territory or him any credit at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I say that is that those people who might think that the chief minister sets out only to offend his political opponents would be dead wrong. I would refer them to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="975"> the much publicised case of the Alice Springs based mining consultant, Bobby Liddle. Mr Liddle thought that Shane Stone, who was then President of the Country&hyphen;Liberal Party, was a mate, as well as being his lawyer, who would treat his personal affairs in the normal confidential manner that lawyers do. He was dead wrong on both counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bobby Liddle, conservative Aboriginal politician, was riding high in 1989. He was much in demand as a consultant and successfully sought preselection as the Country&hyphen;Liberal Party candidate for the sole House of Representatives seat. His success in this regard immediately set the CLP rumour mill rumbling. Rumours soon began circulating in Alice Springs and Darwin about Mr Liddle's alleged marital problems, so much so that the suitability of Mr Liddle's candidacy was placed on the agenda of the party's central council meeting in October that year. Two days before that meeting, Mr Stone, who was acting as an agent for a firm of Melbourne solicitors representing Mr Liddle in his matrimonial problems, wrote to his client, Mr Liddle, asking permission for his files&mdash;that is, his legal files&mdash;from Mr Stone's office to be made available to the CLP members at this meeting. Mr Stone received no such instructions, not surprisingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That did not stop him. He then took Liddle's file&mdash;I stress again this man was Liddle's lawyer&mdash;along to the meeting of the central council of the CLP where it was placed on the front table very prominently among a bundle of other files and papers. Needless to say, at that meeting Liddle was dumped as the Country Liberal Party candidate. He subsequently lodged a complaint against the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory with the Northern Territory Law Society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ethics Committee of the Northern Territory Law Society found that Stone did not have Liddle's express authority to take his file to the meeting. It was not shown that anything from the file was revealed, but the committee said that the file's presence at the meeting had put Liddle `under undue and unfair pressure' at the meeting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that the complaint had been proved and that Stone's conduct was unprofessional because he had failed `to give undivided fidelity to his client's interests'. It found that Stone's conduct was wilful and showed reckless disregard for Liddle and found him guilty of professional misconduct. The Chief Minister was fined $1,000. He appealed to the Supreme Court and the law society later reduced its fine to $750 and its finding to one of unprofessional conduct. These sordid details are best documented in an article in the prominent legal newsletter <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justinian</EMPHASIS> in June 1995, which I seek leave to table.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article says it all. Needless to say&mdash;and I might add this was the view of all the lawyers I spoke to in Darwin at the time, whether they were Labor or conservative&mdash;all the lawyers I spoke to thought that Shane Stone should have been struck off for what he had done with his client's files. I agreed with them. He is now the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. I think it is fair to say that a lot of people in the Northern Territory in relation to this sordid affair would properly describe the Chief Minister's behaviour on this occasion as despicable.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="975"><TITLE>Higher Education: Science Enrolments

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to discuss science enrolments, and I am still reeling from Senator Bob Collins's speech. The university applications and enrolments are in and, as we have discussed over many days and weeks in this chamber, they do demonstrate an overall decline in demand for places in all states except Queensland. Of course, science, engineering and technology courses have been particularly hard hit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite pledges from both the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to review the higher HECS charges for science and any possible or detrimental impact on science enrolments, there has still 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="976"> been no action in this regard. It is notable that, despite considerable forewarning about the Austudy means tests and the difficulties with that, the government prevaricated until it was almost too late and certainly until it became quite embarrassing. But this time we are warning the government so it can avoid further embarrassment, especially in this area of science. The evidence is now there. We are calling on the government for some action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On last Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS> program, the Minister for Science and Technology failed to say that one of the most important aspects of encouraging young people to enter science, engineering and technology courses&mdash;and I do acknowledge that he is very keen to increase enrolments in those areas&mdash;was the current and present appearance of a future in science, and the future does not look too great if you are an aspirant in the science field. Without being able to see a good professional future, it is little wonder that young people are turning away from that field in favour of more secure professions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasing HECS fees for science and technology courses does not make it any more attractive to pursue science courses and science based careers. It certainly highlights a fact that has been highlighted by eroding academic salaries, conditions and opportunities available for any young person contemplating a future in science, engineering or technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is required now on behalf of the government is a serious commitment that would support innovative science programs in schools and create a vital research community. We believe the government has failed to address the fundamental problem of funding cuts, infrastructure decline, personnel losses and, of course, the lack of real job prospects for young people who are considering science based careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A strong and vibrant research community that has adequate funding and a long-term perspective will attract young people because they will see that there is the opportunity to pursue excellence and their imagination in that way. We must also ensure that there is sufficient training through schooling and universities to provide the passion, the intel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lect and the imagination necessary for this research excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government now has a choice and it is certainly the time to act. However, its recent actions are not particularly a good indication for the future. The recent announcement of a five per cent reduction in government funding for universities between 1997 and 1999 is a further kick. With the long&hyphen;awaited increases to some salaries of university academics, the effective funding to universities will be further eroded because money will be taken out to pay those salaries. On top of the cuts that have already been imposed by the government, this is not a good sign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that this government has made significant attempts to link research with industry and has attempted to seek increased funding of research from the private sector. There is a role for this form of collaborative funding in research conducted in Australia. However, we also need to realise that, when private enterprises seek collaboration in government funded research, they are seeking a contribution from the government for their research goals. These goals may not always be in line with what is beneficial for the community in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that government research funds are not used in disproportionate amounts to subsidise the research of the private sector at the expense of basic research funding. So the allocation of increased funding for the Australian Research Council targeted at collaborative research does not necessarily further the goals of basic research funding in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harnessing science for wealth creation is short-sighted and unlikely to bring about the long-term rewards of innovative basic research. What is needed is a balance between the core of curiosity led research and targeted programs to take the particular fruits of that core research to market. It is not reasonable to expect the private sector to pursue research from which they cannot identify outcomes. Their horizon and, of course, their imperative are somewhat different. The benefits of government funded core research are that the community benefits through improved education and, of course, jobs and wealth are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="977"> created from the private sector applying the research that would not otherwise have been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also appears to have perhaps downgraded the role of science and technology in the political hierarchy. The appointment of Dr John Stocker as the chief scientist and chairman of the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council is at a different level from that of his predecessor. His appointment is now under the minister, Peter McGauran, rather than under the Prime Minister. This appears to mean that the government has decided that other areas are more important and perhaps science has been downgraded. I look forward to hearing alternative arguments from Minister McGauran.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the federal government should consider the approach of the Victorian government, where a commitment and `political priority' have been given to science and engineering, recognising their potential for the future. But they do not shy away from the funding cuts that the Victorian government has made to education at all levels and its attacks on student representative organisations and universities. At least Jeff Kennett is talking about investigating where we have gone wrong with science and how we can encourage people to pursue science based careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) said last week that he was confident that research and development funding would be quarantined from the next budget cuts. This recognises the severe impact of the last round of budget cuts on this sector and the place of this sector, with its valuable and important role in Australian industry. There is the opportunity for jobs and development in new industries based on Australian research. The government has a role in getting these new industries going. We should consider industry planning, funding alternatives and setting some long-term national priorities. There is a place for schemes, such as the factor F scheme, seed funding and other financial measures for targeted developments. Further 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cuts would certainly be sending the wrong message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement by the Minister for Science and Technology to make 1997 the year of youth in science with an allocation of $12 million over three years for youth focused science activities is a good start. It is a worthy initiative and certainly one that the Democrats support. Unfortunately, the detail of the $12 million allocation shows that the money will be spent on prizes, training journalists and media outlets as well as some youth activities. A spokeswoman for the minister was reported as saying in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 9 January this year that the minister meant to say that the bulk of the $12 million would go to youth focused activities. Clearly, that is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of action signals a tragic understanding of this government's attitude to science and technology. We must focus on these present attacks on science and technology in universities and research institutions and consider the consequences for Australia's future. It is not good enough for the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to blame the universities or the Minister for Science and Technology to blame the schools for the reduction in enrolments or the number of people pursuing science based paths. The government must address waning science and technology education at all levels through funding cuts, infrastructure decline, personnel losses and the lack of real job prospects for young people considering a career in the science and technology field.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="977"><TITLE>Social Security: Welfare Fraud</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the adjournment debate on the very serious matter of welfare fraud. As Australia begins to rebuild its economy, it is extremely important for all taxpayers that those people who receive welfare benefits&mdash;social security payments of one sort or another&mdash;do so based on genuine need. The coalition is committed to fairness in this scheme. It is believed by them and all of us that it is unfair to those people who are genuinely in need, and the taxpayers of Australia, to allow people to rort the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="978">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government left the system riddled with instances of fraud. We are attempting to restore accountability to the system, which follows our election commitment, in which we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is committed to taking all possible steps to prevent fraud&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and to ensure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that only those who are eligible under the Social Security Act are receiving those payments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is determined to restore the community's confidence in this system. She has directed attention and resources to tackling the problem and very recently reported on the first report on welfare fraud, which was tabled in this parliament. The findings very clearly justify the government's fraud control strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It revealed that taxpayers are now saving over $10 million every single week as a result of the review conducted over the last six months of last year. Total debt recoveries in that time were $175 million, which is an increase of 49 per cent on the same time last financial year. Compliance reviews increased by 28.7 per cent to almost $1.5 million, resulting in an identification of overpayments during that time of $105 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of South Australia, social security spending is particularly significant. Almost 40 per cent of South Australians&mdash;that is, 578,000 people&mdash;receive social security payments totalling $15&half; billion per year. This is the largest percentage of any Australian state population in receipt of these benefits. While South Australia comprises 8.1 per cent of Australia's total population, the state actually accounts for 9.5 per cent of Australia's total social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, Senator Newman's review of benefits revealed that, in the 122,000 reviews conducted by the department, almost $1 million per week of ongoing savings was identified. There were 13,000 cases of overpayment. Most importantly to me, the public showed that they were very keen to be involved in the identification of welfare fraud, finding those people who are taking benefits that are more properly directed to the needy recipients in this country. Much 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the information provided to Senator Newman's department relating to welfare cheats came from 26,000 reports received from members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, our focus is on the government directing funds to those who are genuinely needy. This approach stands in very stark contrast to the one of our predecessors. When Mr Keating had his hands on the levers, we had an absolutely woeful half-hearted record on social security compliance. The data&hyphen;matching program that was introduced in 1991 on the basis that it would lead to savings of over $300 million per year in its first year of introduction saved only $17 million. That is $17 million of a projected $300 million in savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, boasted in 1995 that we were leading the world in social security compliance efforts. In October 1994, he claimed in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that social security payments are properly targeted to those in need . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Three years later, in South Australia alone, we have identified $1 million per week in savings and $10 million per week nationally. That was an amazing claim for him to have made three years ago. Like his former leader, he was trying to tell people that, in terms of social security fraud detection, that was as good as it got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman's six&hyphen;monthly report&mdash;I should correct my earlier statement; it was her second report and not her first&mdash;indicated that, just like other claims of `this is as good as it gets', it was a hollow promise. Labor sat on its hands when it came to fraud control in the social security system, and it simply did not put enough resources in to stay a jump ahead of the welfare cheats. The extent of the problem that was left has been revealed in these reports by Senator Newman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the message to welfare cheats from this government is: if you are minded to cheat the system, if you do not play by the rules, we will catch you. The message to taxpayers is: we are targeting your money better, we are making recipients more accountable and we are making sure that welfare payments are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="979"> wasted. I believe that welfare is a justifiable payment to those families in need and I am sure that all Australian taxpayers would agree that we are prepared to pay for social security support for those who are in genuine need. But we all&mdash;very correctly&mdash;resent paying for a system that rewards the dishonest and profits the cheats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More focused welfare payments will restore integrity to, and return public confidence in, the system. Also, properly understanding the way the true picture develops on welfare means that the government can plan and more effectively run the welfare system. It will make the social security system work better and it will make policy decisions based on correct assumptions, numbers that are true and budget estimates that are truthful. That is part of the coalition's promise to this country and it will return good administration in social security for all of us.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="979"><TITLE>Youth Suicide</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the issue of suicide in Australia and, in particular, the problems facing our young people. As you are all aware, youth suicide is one of the major causes of death among young people, rated against car accidents, drownings and poisonings. Suicide now claims more young men's lives than car accidents do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as many of you may be aware, the statistics presented are not a true reflection of the current situation. Suicide will not be officially noted unless it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Many families and friends, for a whole range of reasons, will not characterise the death of a loved one as a suicide. The number of attempted suicides is enormous and unfortunately young men succeed in their more violent attempts to end their lives. Recently, a rural suicide prevention project estimated that 80,000 people attempt suicide each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What remains true is that young people are dying at a much faster rate and that is a reflection on our society. The question I often contemplate is the level of stress that young people face today and how that compares to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even a generation ago. At the moment, over 25,000 young people are homeless in Australia. The fact that Australia is being cited as one of the leaders in youth homelessness and youth suicide gives impetus to the desperate need for governments of all persuasions to effect change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our indigenous young people are still facing disproportionate levels of incarceration, arrest, inadequate access to health services, and abuse and violence against them. They are faced with a society that not only rejects their youth but also their culture and their self&hyphen;determination. Young people in 1997 need a feeling of identity and belonging and, if this government continues to ignore the holistic view of youth suicide, many young people in this country will continue to have feelings of failure, anger, isolation and hopelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has, to date, ignored the ramifications of its narrow&hyphen;minded and expedient programs on young people. For example, recently when I was visiting a refuge for young people I was told of the problems facing the young people who had just been taken off the defunded LEAP program. For these already socially isolated young people, the effect was dramatic. Suddenly they had nowhere to go; they were unable to finish the project they had started and they were definitely not involved in any consultation about changes to labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government believes in telling young people what to do, instead of listening. It is made up of patronising parties that rely on an antiquated view of young people being seen and not heard. They are parties that continuously widen the gap between those who have opportunity and those who have none. They are parties that make charities, families, non&hyphen;government organisations and advocacy groups cope with increasing pressures that young people are facing. And why is it that young people are not being heard? Perhaps it is due to the fact that they cannot vote and there is no medium for them to want to, or be able to, change the process that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his ideologues espouse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="980">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that the government is conducting a forum on this issue this week. It certainly appears to fill the criteria of the standard consultation that the coalition government uses&mdash;lots of media and big names. Obviously, politicians from all sides of the chamber support an initiative that hopefully will result in some recommendations that will improve the situation for young people. We hope the Prime Minister starts these consultations with young people, in particular, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as he promised he would do in his lead&hyphen;up to the election. It is our greatest hope that the recommendations produced by the youth suicide forum will have a direct link to budget appropriations. That is when we will know the extent of this government's commitment to the welfare of young people in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.37 p.m." PAGE="980"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.37 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 15 January 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Does the Minister intend to scrutinise the environmental credentials of the Perth airport bidders; if so, how will this be done; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Is the Minister aware that the Conservation Council of Western Australia has prepared a written questionnaire to be answered by all bidders for the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Is the Minister aware that the Conservation Council of Western Australia has been unsuccessful in obtaining the names of six of the seven Perth airport bidders from the Office of Asset Sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Is the Minister aware that one of the bidders, Australian Pacific Airports, has announced its bid for ownership of the Perth airport and, at a public meeting on 26 November 1996, agreed to complete a questionnaire on its position in relation to the natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Does the Minister agree that this gives Australian Pacific Airports an advantage in the bidding process, as only its position on natural environment issues can be publicised; if so, will the Minister release the names of the other six bidders for Perth airport so that the questionnaire can be put to the other bidders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Does the Minister agree that the public has a right to know the environmental credentials of all the bidders so a comparison can be made.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="981" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) A letter from Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell in respect of the request from the Conservation Council of WA was referred to me for response. This letter was responded to on my behalf by Dr Kemp, the Minister assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp's response to Senator Campbell explains that environmental considerations have been given a strong emphasis in the bidding process. Those consortia currently participating in Stage 2 of the bidding process were required to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> submit binding bids to the Commonwealth by 30 January 1997. As a part of those bids, bidders were required to provide:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> details of environmental planning proposed for the airport over the next five years; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a depiction in diagrammatic form of the environmental management structure proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, one of the ongoing privatisation objectives, against which all bids are being assessed, is that each Airport Lessee Company acts to promote the economic development of its Phase 1 airport in a way that is responsive to the interests of users, the environment and the region in which the airport is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this, there will be a number of obligations that will be incumbent on successful bidders as a part of the post&hyphen;privatisation regulatory regime. In particular, the successful Airport Lessee Company will be required to submit to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, for approval by that Minister, a detailed draft environmental strategy within 12 months of the acquisition of the lease. This environmental strategy must relate to a period of five years. An updated environmental strategy must be submitted before the expiry of any existing environmental strategy. The Airport Lessee Company will also have to comply with any Environmental Regulations made under the Airports Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am aware that the Conservation Council of WA sought the identity of the parties bidding for Perth airport. I am also aware that the Conservation Council prepared a written questionnaire to be answered by all bidders for Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I am aware that the Conservation Council of WA was unsuccessful in obtaining the identities of bidders from the Office of Asset Sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's approach to such requests in the lead&hyphen;up to the closing date for bids has been to neither confirm nor deny the participation of consortia in Stage 2 of the bidding process. This approach has been adopted in order to protect the confidentiality of the bidding process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I am aware that the Australian Pacific Airports Corporation (APAC) has announced its bid for ownership of Perth airport and has agreed to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="982"> complete a questionnaire on its position in relation to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) For the reasons outlined above, whilst bidders are free to announce their bidding intentions, I do not feel that it is appropriate for the Government to disclose the identity of the bidders for Perth airport. Completion of the questionnaire by APAC does not, in itself, give APAC an unfair advantage in the bidding process as it has been open to all bidders for Perth airport to approach the Conservation Council of WA in order to discuss how they propose to deal with environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The identity of bidders was not made public at the time for the reasons stated above. It is important, however, to recognise that environmental issues have been given considerable weight in the bidding process. Further, the post&hyphen;privatisation regulatory regime is designed to ensure that the operators of the Phase 1 airports deal with environmental issues in the appropriate manner.</PARA>
