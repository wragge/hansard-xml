<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time now, the Speaker and I have been considering the future administrative arrangements for the parliament in the context of increasing demands for services at a time of budgetary restraint. After reviewing comments from the heads of the five parliamentary departments, we have decided to implement a management structure based on the two chamber departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The functions of the present three joint departments&mdash;the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department&mdash;will be merged into the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This two chamber department structure is the best way of achieving a dynamic and responsive organisation which will allow the parliament to make significant savings while improving the services provided to senators, members and committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Speaker and I know that we will have the full and professional support of all staff in meeting the objectives of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the parliament's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked the departmental heads to provide us by Tuesday, 18 March with an implementation plan for the transition to the new structure. I will advise the Senate as soon as practicable after that, and as required by the rules of the Senate I will be consulting the Appropriations and Staffing Committee as the matter progresses.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 and cognate bills form part of measures designed to increase cost recovery from the Insolvency and Trustee Service, which administers bankruptcy matters. In total, the measures proposed by the government are designed to raise some $22.3 million over four years, being $3.6 million in 1996-97 and $6&frac14; million in each of the out years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at how the bills seek to do this. They do so by increasing the flag fall on the estates administered by the official trustee; by replacing the existing fees payable in respect of all bankruptcies by a flat levy on all realisations in bankruptcies; and by requiring registered trustees to hold trust funds in interest bearing accounts and to pay the interest earned to consolidated revenue. This is similar to the existing arrangements for interest earned on the common investment fund managed by the official trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis for these proposals came in our government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> proposal before the election. In that document, the coalition committed itself to raising some $15 million over three years in the area of personal insolvency. It is worth looking at that document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is some capacity for increased cost recovery in ITSA. ITSA has total revenue of approximately $27 million of which $22 million originates from Parliamentary appropriations. Better cost recovery will result in further savings of $15 million over three years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed greater cost recovery in this area may seem attractive, but it is simply bad policy. The persons who are ultimately likely to bear the cost of these increased fees will not be those people who either through their own financial mismanagement or through circumstances beyond their control have gone bankrupt. The people who will be slugged will be the creditors. The innocent parties in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1246"> insolvency cases will be the ones who will be left to carry the burden of these increased fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these creditors are small business owners&mdash;the people that this government has pretended to want to protect. These measures will punish those businesses not because they have done anything wrong but because they have had the misfortune of doing business with someone who has ultimately gone bankrupt. Why have the government led people to believe that they are acting in the interests of small business when this measure is ripping money from the small business sector? Why have they got it so wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, one has to look at what has to be called the sloppy job that was done in putting this commitment together. The estimates of expenditure on and revenue raised by ITSA in our pre-election document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> were based on the 1993-94 annual report&mdash;outdated. They could have got the most recent figures. Had they done that, they would have recognised that in 1995-96 a total of $28.7 million was appropriated to ITSA and approximately $7 million was raised by way of revenue. Even in 1994-95 the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date financial data would have shown that ITSA received $27&half; million in appropriations and raised $8 million in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the individual fee increases to see what the government is doing. There will be a flag fall fee on the estates administered by ITSA, and that will rise from $2,000 to $4,000. This measure is expected to raise some $1.62 million in a full year. During estimates the Attorney-General's Department admitted that ITSA had estimated that the increase in the flag fall fee alone&mdash;and this is worth listening to, especially by those on the other side&mdash;would reduce the number of estates producing a dividend from 45 per cent to 30 per cent. So creditors in one out of every six bankruptcies will, because of this flag fall measure, now not receive a dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the proposal to increase revenue from the realisation charges will be achieved through an increase in the flat fee payable from three per cent to eight per cent. This measure is expected to raise some $4.2 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million in a full year. In the last financial year, the total dividend paid was only $12.4 million. So one-third of last year's financial dividends will now be appropriated by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the payment of interest earned on realisation by registered trustees to consolidated revenue is expected to raise $430,000 in a full year. This interest is currently paid to creditors. So, once again, it is going to be those innocent small business people and individuals who will be ripped off by the operation of this particular measure. This revenue has been calculated on an assumed four per cent interest rate on such accounts, although no such minimum rate is required by the legislation. This is a senseless slug that will only harm ordinary Australians and, principally, small business owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 does have some redeeming features. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966, which Labor does not seek to oppose. On that basis, I will shortly be moving an amendment to the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill which will delete those provisions of the bill which seek to facilitate the implementation of the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. For the reasons I have already mentioned, Labor will be opposing the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and focus on some of the provisions of that legislation. Clause 4 of the bill imposes a fee of $1,500 on applications to become a registered trustee. Clause 5 imposes a $1,000 registration fee. As a result, first time applicants to become registered trustees will now have to pay $2,500. Clause 6 of the bill also imposes a $1,000 fee for extension of registration. Clause 7 imposes a $500 fee for variation of the condition attaching to a person's registration as a trustee. I note that the introduction of fees for registration as a trustee, similar in magnitude to the above, were foreshadowed in the previous government's Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. Accordingly, we will support this particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the election of the Howard government, we were promised a sudden boom in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1247"> confidence in the business community. Quite simply, that has not materialised in the way we were promised. As a result, the number of bankruptcies rose to over 4,800 in the June quarter last year and to a staggering 5,400 in the September quarter&mdash;the highest, I believe, on record. The number of bankruptcies dropped only slightly in the December quarter but still remained unnecessarily high at some 5,100. Far from the post election bounce that was promised by the government, the figures on bankruptcy indicate that we are not on a smooth path to that sort of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the September quarter figures show, the total number of bankruptcies and part X arrangements, assignments and compositions have risen in Queensland by over 45 per cent on the previous year. In the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia, the rises are 50 per cent, 54 per cent and 55 per cent respectively. In the ACT, the part of Australia most immediately impacted upon by this government, the rate of bankruptcies has risen by a staggering 63 per cent on the previous year. Some sort of boom! One of the few states to buck this trend is New South Wales which has had the lowest rate of increase in bankruptcies at only 19.6 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator Neal</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the only Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say only 19, but that is small in relation to other states&mdash;and, as Senator Neal says, it is the only state with a Labor government. I also want to turn this morning to the appalling way this government has handled the pursuit of one of our most infamous and notorious bankrupts, Christopher Skase. We were all glad to hear late last year that the chase for Skase had been resumed. But that was only after this government and, in particular, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) let the Australian people down by failing to seize the first available opportunity to continue to pursue Mr Skase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me relate some of those facts, because I think they are important. On 26 August 1996, the trustee of Mr Skase's bankrupt estate, Mr Donnelly, made an application under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act for financial assistance to further pursue the assets of Mr Skase. Section 305 of the act 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vests the power to grant such assistance in the Attorney-General. However, as most of these decisions are primarily bureaucratic in nature, the power has been delegated to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and the assistant secretary of the secretariat branch of the Insolvency and Trustee Service, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was on 26 August. On 27 September 1996, the assistant secretary, pursuant to that delegation, determined that the application should not be granted. Without knowing more about the detail of that application, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to criticise the officer involved in that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the decision failed to understand, I believe, the importance of Mr Skase as a symbol of the excesses of the 1980s corporate Australia. It failed to recognise the deep and continuing hurt and offence felt by many ordinary Australians who lost money to this deceptive man. It failed to recognise the importance of taking all reasonable steps to pursue this man as far as possible, to not allow him to forget that, while he, through his dishonesty and deception, is living in luxury, he did a lot of damage to the reputation of Australian businesses, to the financial structure of Australian businesses, to the esteem in which our laws were held, and, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many good, honest, hardworking Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That a bureaucrat, strictly applying that section in accordance with the issued guidelines, should too narrowly construe his duty is perhaps capable of comprehension. But, mindful of the real anger Australians still feel towards Skase, mindful of the damage he has done to our reputation, mindful of the way that he continues to snub his nose at Australia and the rule of law here from faraway Majorca, the Attorney should not have condoned such a decision. For him to have done so, for him to have let it go through to the keeper at the time, is simply deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was revealed in Senate estimates, the Attorney's office was briefed to the effect that the Skase decision was pending and that it was likely to be made on 24 September 1996. But Mr Williams failed, once again, to act. His office was formally notified of the deci 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1248"> sion on 2 October 1996. Again, he failed to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney, despite having the power to overturn this decision, failed to act prior to the decision becoming public on 9 October 1996. Even then&mdash;despite his office having been told during the afternoon of that day that the story was about to break on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> that night, despite knowing that even at that particular time he could have overturned that decision&mdash;he failed to act. Even when he did act, it took this Attorney some six weeks to make a decision that he could have made in six seconds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) then had the audacity to blame the bureaucrats for a decision which they knew that the Attorney had known about for some time and which, through the Attorney's own inaction, Mr Williams had condoned, is not only one of the most appalling acts of self-denial this place has seen but also one of the most stupendous failings of ministerial responsibility of recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Attorney owes a lot of apologies to a lot of people, including the Prime Minister, for not being alive at the wheel when this decision was conveyed to his office. He also needs to apologise for letting the department run in auto mode since the time he was alerted the decision had been pending. I think he also should apologise, Senator Harradine, to the bureaucrats whom he has let the carry the can as a result of his own ineptitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen, even in recent days, both Mr Williams and Mr Howard lamely maintaining their defence by briefing journalists that it was all the department's fault. It was not. The minister is responsible. The minister always, as was recognised in the estimates process, had a legal capacity to intervene and to ensure another decision was taken. The minister was on notice, and the minister did not act. For that, he should be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even today, Senator Harradine, there are still some very basic questions left hanging in respect of this matter. As of last week in the estimates process, the government is still refusing to tell the Australian public how much money the Attorney has set aside for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the funding of the continued pursuit of Skase. All the Attorney has said is that the amount is comparatively small when compared with the $800,000 spent to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no legitimate reason why&mdash;with Mr Donnelly's report just about in the hands of the Attorney&mdash;the Australian public cannot be told how much resource this government is putting into the continued chase for Skase. The reason why the Attorney will not reveal the sum is that the amount is embarrassingly small. It is so small that he is afraid that it will show the government's decision to be nothing more than a very cheap political stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Financial accountability means that this parliament will find out at some particular stage how much money has been allocated by the Attorney in this matter. We will have to find out, and I put the parliamentary secretary on notice that during the committee stage of this bill I will be asking more questions about why we do not know and why the Attorney will not tell the Australian public how much more money he is putting into it. If he is putting enough resource into the chase for Skase to be proud of, then he should be telling us. Our fear is that he has basically embarked upon a token effort here to save his political skin. That is not the motivation that should be involved in a matter like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we believe there is no reason why the amount approved should not be released and the Attorney-General should come clean with it now. The opposition does, however, recognise that the chase for Skase has been continued. It is a pity, though, we cannot appreciate how dinkum the government is in respect of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, as I have indicated earlier, I will be moving some amendments in relation to this legislation during the committee stage. I also indicate that the opposition will be supporting some parts of this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the opportunity in the second reading debate to include some general remarks on bankruptcy matters in discussing these bills. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1249"> (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 create machinery and administrative mechanisms and raise charges to facilitate the substantial changes which were ushered into bankruptcy law last year. Those substantial changes were brought about by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 and will operate as measures which will further constrain dishonest and deceitful persons from ripping off ordinary Australians who, in good faith, provide finance, goods and services in the ordinary course of trade and commerce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some bankrupts are, of course, ordinary Australians fallen on hard times, but the people whom I refer to are economic and social vandals and should be given little quarter and little leeway. The Australian public, Senator Bolkus, has been rightly incensed by the way that the likes of Christopher Skase have been wrongly able to evade lawful civil and, in some cases, criminal prosecution. At least Alan Bond, who is now in gaol, had the courage to stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly pleased to see the inclusion of section 121 of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 which, if our reading is correct, will address many of the issues which allow these scoundrels to fleece financial institutions, small creditors, the mums and dads of this nation and the revenue of the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 121, on our reading, will have the effect of voiding transactions ab initio where the transferor's main purpose in making that transfer was to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the bankrupt's creditors or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division amongst the bankrupt's creditors. If this law had been in place during the 1980s and early 1990s, many small businesses and investors would have been spared the financial ruin caused by cheats and crooks whose sole purpose was to satisfy their own greed and the greed of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a disgrace that the pursuit of big&hyphen;time white collar crooks has been so difficult. If it were not for the tenacity of social and political commentators&mdash;and I name just one&mdash;such as Paul Barry, who is the author of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rise and Fall of Alan Bond</EMPHASIS>, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as well as others of his ilk, then ordinary Australians would have been denied the rightful prosecution of bad bankrupts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of bankruptcy law in this country has been testimony to the legal and political reality that individuals, family farmers and small businesses, who occupy the less lucrative end of the scale, have had applied to them a form of class discrimination and class policing. People in small businesses have never had the slack cut to them that the failed entrepreneurs of the 1980s did, simply because they did not have the same sorts of political connections. We know from our analysis of criminal statistics that some people in this country have the law applied to them in a more rigorous manner than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the role of foreign and other trustees or advisers. All big time white&hyphen;collar criminals have big lawyers, big accountants and big advisers in tow and not much that is ethical about them. Most of them go blithely along in their business today untouched by the scandal of the bankrupts. As one example, let us look at Bond and how his advisers are being dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, his Swiss banker, Mr Bollag, is considered to be central to Mr Bond's financial affairs and is being currently questioned, I understand, as to whether he had any part in the deception that has seen Alan Bond's bankrupt estate realise very little of its true worth. It is proper that all connected persons are questioned. I believe that section 121 will go a long way to prevent the hiding of assets in the future so that we do not find a person such as Alan Bond, who now earns $40 a week in prison, being able to miraculously produce a $750,000 payment which was not acknowledged in the information given to his bankruptcy trustees. Are we all mugs to accept that state of affairs and to let it continue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is lamentable that the law we are about to enact today will not apply to existing or past petitioners for bankruptcy. But this chamber, as the whole parliament does, respects the rule of retrospectivity. The previous government was far too slow in responding to the excesses of the 1980s. I and many others believe that was the result of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1250"> being far too close in political and financial terms to many of those failed entrepreneurs. The money that has been poured into political parties then and now will involve a tainting of the political and legislative process. Some of the arrangements with mates in the last decade were profoundly unethical and immoral. In my own state the legacy of those days is the imprisonment of two past premiers and one deputy premier from both sides of the political spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the greater problem that the Bond and Skase matters exemplified are the weaknesses in our system of corporate governance. Shareholders are still required to challenge board members and directors but have failed to do so with any of the authority and the vigour that they should have. That may be because we operate in a system where our shareholders do not have democratic rights, and the institutions and the large shareholders dominate the process and they are very much tied up in an elite manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulatory authority, now the Australian Securities Commission, should be as hard hitting as the very best of such agencies internationally. A major publicity campaign on the shortcomings of auditors needs to be implemented. Finally, the banks of this country now with their finances recovered on the backs of small business must frequently be reminded of their part in allowing entrepreneurs to survive with creative balance sheets. It is only when people such as Tiny Rowland did the work on Alan Bond that the whole pack of cards came down. The so-called banking people who were supposed to be able to regulate these matters were incapable of doing that analysis themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has, by the bills before us, sought to implement greater cost recovery. Our concern with the charges in the estate charges bill that will be implemented is that less of a pie will be left over for equitable distribution of the bankrupt's estate. That is a political decision the government will have to wear and, on my part, I find it difficult to see how such a scenario is beneficial to small business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that these various amending bills will allow dishonest persons to be pinned 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down, then the law will finally be coming to terms with the legacy of the greed of the 1980s. I must say that it is with some concern that I see the drive towards simplification of the various corporate laws resulting in less oversight in many respects. If anything is to be gained from those experiences it is the knowledge that unrestrained individualism to the detriment of the community has little value in the long-term prosperity of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will only be when the mechanisms of ethics, accountability and transparency are universally applied that the Australian public will become more relaxed that the Alan Bonds and Christopher Skases of our land will never get another strong toehold in our community or our economy. The Australian community has lived long enough with the consequences of the actions of these people and still does so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will not be proposing amendments to these bills unless amendments which substantially improve these bills are offered in the committee stage. We will be supporting the bills as they are put.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the speeches of Senator Bolkus and Senator Murray. The matters they put forward I think are matters that should be taken into account. But there is another side to bankruptcy laws in addition to pursuing those people who, as it were, rorted the system. The other side of it is that these laws are there to help those people who legitimately&mdash;people without any fault&mdash;go bankrupt. That is the other side of the law that is being introduced this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is proper that we make it clear that this parliament understands that it is not only crooks who go bankrupt and bring devastation upon the society but also people who, despite all the good efforts and honesty they put into any sort of enterprise, nevertheless go bankrupt. These measures introduced this morning will help them as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Ellison, is handling this matter on behalf of the government because he was part of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1251"> committee that looked at this issue so very well. He did a lot of good work on that committee. On this broadcast day, I acknowledge the work that he has done, not only on this report but on many others in the past.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, may I thank senators for their contribution to this debate, and particularly Senator Cooney for his kind comments. It is true that we both sat on that committee, Senator Cooney. I think you chaired it in 1995 in relation to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. It was as a result of one of the submissions to that committee that we have implemented a provision that deals with the keeping of a trust account by trustees&mdash;that is, they keep one single trust account relating to all the estates that they administer. I will come to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of increased cost recovery from ITSA, the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia, was announced in the government's pre&hyphen;election policy statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">commitments</EMPHASIS>. These measures give effect to that policy. The bills before the Senate provide for separate legislation imposing charges that are, with the exception of the interest charge, currently imposed by regulation under the Bankruptcy Act 1966.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed fees and charges are not altogether new. They involve an increase in existing fees already collected. In the case of interest from trust fund moneys in the administrations of registered trustees, they merely apply the requirements that have existed in respect of ITSA bankruptcies since 1980. This will partly offset the cost borne by taxpayers in maintaining the bankruptcy system. At the same time, the measure contained in the bill significantly reduces the paperwork burden on trustees in complying with the Bankruptcy Act, which should reduce cost to the administrations which are borne by creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I refer to some of the matters that Senator Bolkus raised. At the outset, Senator Bolkus mentioned the flagfall for the official trustee, which is raised from $2,000 to $4,000. That was done by way of regula 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion in December last year to achieve parity between ITSA's fees and those in the private sector. If there is any submission on the part of the opposition that this is contained in this legislation, that is not so. I make that point for the benefit of those who have any doubt, and it really is quite misleading to say that this legislation does that. The flagfall increase was done by regulation in December last year. I also remind the Senate that, in relation to the question of this increased flagfall, one still has the choice between a registered trustee and the services of ITSA. So it is not as if this has been imposed willy&hyphen;nilly on creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other aspects of the opposition's position on which I will comment. Firstly, the opposition, by opposing the measures mentioned, is denying the government the opportunity to impose the realisations charge&mdash;even at the current rate. The current rate of three per cent has been at that level since 1988. The proposal to require the payment to consolidated revenue of interest earned on funds held in trust by registered trustees supports the change in arrangements that will allow registered trustees to hold a single trust account for all estates if they wish to do so. I mentioned at the outset that this was a matter which was raised before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in 1995. It also removes an existing anomaly whereby interest on funds held in trust by the official trustee has for some time been paid to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new interest charge on interest on trust fund moneys in administrations of registered trustees merely applies the requirements that have existed in respect of ITSA bankruptcies since 1980. What you have here is the treatment of both on the same level&mdash;levelling the playing field&mdash;and making the situation apply equally to estates administered by registered trustees or by ITSA. There is no reason why there should be any difference in approach between the two sectors. I point out to the Senate that the amount of interest is payable as the amount derived less bank fees. While it is true that the increase in charges may have an impact on creditors, the creditors are also among the principal beneficiaries of the system. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1252">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not true to say that the government will achieve full cost recovery for ITSA. These proposals will go a long way to making ITSA more viable in that respect and towards achieving greater cost recovery. But it is not true that there will be 100 per cent cost recovery, as maintained by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit, with respect, that the opposition fails to recognise that the measures contained in these bills will significantly reduce the paperwork burden on trustees in complying with the Bankruptcy Act which, in turn, should reduce the cost of administrations which are borne by creditors. So we are looking at a streamlining of the system to reduce the paperwork, to treat registered trustees the same as ITSA, and to lessen the cost which will be borne by the creditors in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worthwhile to dwell on the point that Senator Bolkus made that the flagfall raised by regulation last year would limit the amount of funds available to creditors. Of course, in only 20 per cent of bankruptcies are there any assets to speak of which are divided. Eighty per cent of bankruptcies have little or no assets for division among creditors. So you are looking at a small rump of bankruptcies numbering 20 per cent. You then look at the flagfall itself&mdash;it is an increase in fee of $2,000. That, in the scheme of things, will not prejudice creditors but, in the long run&mdash;with its assistance in cost recovery&mdash;it will make ITSA more viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where we have to look at the functions that ITSA performs. ITSA delivers a number of public interest services and I think it is important that the Senate remembers this. Some of those are the development of policy advice, information to debtors, education to debtors and creditors and generally the education of the commercial community, and particularly in providing financial counsellors and practitioners. It also exercises the role of regulation and it provides the official receiver with powers in relation to bankruptcy and trustees, and also there are law enforcement responsibilities that ensure that a credible system is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as this, the official trustee, through ITSA, administers roughly 92 per cent of all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bankrupt estates. ITSA performs the function of administering non&hyphen;fee paying estates on behalf of creditors, and as well there is the new debt agreement system, which Senator Cooney would recall from the legislation going before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which involves small estates of $52,000 and under. That avoids the formality and the complexity of bankruptcy and, of course, ITSA has to administer that as well. ITSA has wide ranging roles and you can see the importance of having cost recovery in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray raised some very interesting points about the 1980s, and I might just touch on the Skase matter. The opposition really has a cheek raising the Skase matter today. Where was the opposition when it was in government in the 1980s in relation to the rorts and the entrepreneurs that were making hay while the sun shone under the Keating and Hawke governments? What were they doing about that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad Senator Murray reminded me of what actually went on during those days, because we have a situation where the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is determined to do everything possible to bring to justice Christopher Skase, and additional resources have been provided to Mr Donnelly in relation to the Skase matter. If I were to put on record in the Senate the detailing of that resource&mdash;the details of what the Attorney&hyphen;General wanted to do and the detail of the strategy of the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;no doubt the people who would be rubbing their hands with glee would be Mr Skase and his lawyers. I am not about to put on record the Commonwealth's position in relation to the Skase matter. Suffice to say, the Attorney&hyphen;General has provided additional resources and is pursuing this matter with vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Bolkus wants to raise these points and shoot the Attorney&hyphen;General's position down in flames and give Mr Skase and his solicitors some advantage, well, be it on his head, but the government will not be a party to that. It would be irresponsible for the Attorney&hyphen;General to divulge any detail of what really is an operational matter. It has been a longstanding convention in the Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1253"> and its committees that details of operational matters are not made public, for very good reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I foreshadow to Senator Bolkus that, for those reasons, any questions which go into the detail of the Attorney&hyphen;General's conduct of the Skase matter will be met with the answer I have just given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the Democrats will not be opposing any of these bills, and I thank Senator Murray in that regard. I also note that the opposition will not be opposing the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. As I say, the measures before the Senate today consolidate existing charges within a single package that will have the effect of simplifying the imposition and collection of charges. It also provided the Inspector&hyphen;General with the authority and responsibility for auditing accounts of administrations of both registered trustees and the official trustee. The combined effect of these measures already enacted in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 and the powers proposed in the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill will allow for enhanced supervision of trustees. By opposing these measures, the opposition will be denying the government the opportunity to make important reforms in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask you, Parliamentary Secretary, what government policy is in this regard. There has to be, in my view, some penalty for all those who make these things possible. As you know, during my speech at the second reading stage I mentioned that auditors, bankers, accountants and lawyers have either been dilatory in their supervision of the affairs of high profile bankrupts or are accomplices. Although sometimes they can evade the law, the question is whether they should be exposed.

I would like a response on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I would indicate is that an article on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 28 February, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition have no objections at all to the central provisions of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill; indeed, we have never had. But one could fairly ask, with all of the huffing and puffing that has been going on over the last six months by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) over the issue of the alleged lack of proper experience and qualifications of the CASA board, why this legislation has been hanging around for as long as it has been. It was introduced into the House of Representatives in June last year and it was entirely open to the government, in terms of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> managing its program, to have this legislation brought on far before this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One really does have to pose the questions: with all of the high profile that has been given to this, why has this piece of legislation, for no good reason that we can see, been lying around for months and why has it not been given some priority up the pecking order in terms of legislation in this house and been dealt with before now? Mr Sharp could have had his opportunity, as far as the opposition are concerned, to have made these additional appointments a long time ago. The reason one has to pose those questions is to question the bona fides of the government on this issue and in particular to question the bona fides of the minister in this over-the-top campaign that he has been running against the board members of CASA and in particular the strident and indeed reckless criticisms that the minister has engaged upon recently of that board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One criticism in particular deserves mention. I was extremely angry when, driving along, I first heard it on the car radio. I thought, `The minister really has lost his marbles completely in terms of his pursuit of the CASA board on this one.' He said very specifically that the board had not discharged its proper responsibilities and therefore deserved the sack in respect of the DC3 incident, which of course I personally recall only too well. The federal minister for transport said that the board of CASA deserved the sack because the board had failed to prosecute the people involved in that DC3 incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with utter disbelief that I heard that statement. That was a reckless statement by the minister and the minister in fact should have had his backside firmly kicked afterwards by his colleagues for overreaching himself and for going over the top. The board of CASA does not prosecute anyone; neither did the CAA. Indeed I have no doubt that Senator Ellison, who is in the chamber at the moment, would be perfectly well aware of the point that I am making. The CAA has never been responsible for prosecutions. The statutory responsibility for that job rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WEST" NAMEID="1X4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator West</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And rightly so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1259"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And rightly so, and always has. The fact, which the minister did not even bother to regard in his reckless attacks on this board, was that CASA discharged all of its statutory responsibilities in respect of this incident as it happened. It did forward all of the necessary briefs to the appropriate authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Director of Public Prosecutions, no doubt in an entirely proper way, determined that it was not in the public interest to prosecute. There was a Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report published on this incident. The DPP reviewed that decision after the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation completed its report and on that review determined again that there would be no prosecution in the public interest. That was a decision, entirely properly, of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Any complaints or concerns about the failure to prosecute on the matter should therefore be directed to the federal Attorney-General (Mr Williams) by his colleague the minister for transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was a glaring and transparent demonstration publicly of how utterly irrational and how utterly insupportable this minister's campaign against the current board has been. He really exposed himself profoundly with that ignorant and improper attack on the board. It was then&mdash;in terms of the tit for tat that has been going on with respect to the utterly destabilising nature of this paper and public war with the minister&mdash;that the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority responded, as he had to, to point out the facts in the matter and that the minister was utterly wrong in respect of his criticism of the board in failing to prosecute the people involved in the DC3 incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, one then only has to make a reference to the minister's own public explanation last year as to why he wanted the original board to quit. It is worth while revisiting that extraordinary statement, which I think the minister himself conceded afterwards&mdash;to paraphrase what he said&mdash;was not his best performance. When he was originally suggesting that the board should go, that was at a time when, so far as he was concerned as minister, the board had not had an opportunity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to demonstrate whether or not it was competent at all. Indeed, the Monarch incident and all the rest of it that the minister and the rest of us were so concerned about all predated this board. What explanation did the minister give publicly for why he wanted the board to go originally? Let me remind the Senate. The reason the minister wanted the board to go was: `I have obligations to other people.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reference to `other people' was meant in the ordinary sense, not the lawyer sense&mdash;in the sense of ordinary people like me&mdash;that is, the obligations he had to other people whom he wanted to put on the board. That is what he meant and that is what he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this over-the-top breast beating, allegedly in pursuit of better safety, has been a sham from then until now. The minister started this campaign by admitting publicly that the reason he wanted to get rid of the board was to put other people on the board. He topped it off just recently with that over-the-top nonsensical attack on the board for failing to prosecute the DC3 people when he should have known as federal transport minister that that board and no other board has ever had the responsibility for prosecuting and that on this occasion the management of the CAA did everything that was required of them under the act and forwarded those briefs to the DPP, which then determined twice that there would be no prosecution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1260">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That raises the important question of what is the function of a board of a statutory authority. The function of the board&mdash;and I want to disabuse the sort of atmosphere that has been created in the community on this&mdash;is not to go out and inspect aircraft. The board does not go out and test pilots. The board does not do ramp checks on aircraft. What the board does is ensure that the organisation that does do all these things does it effectively and efficiently and does it in accordance with the statutory obligations that the organisation has under the act. That is the test of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add in respect of that issue, they have on the board in an ex officio capacity the chief executive of the organisation, Leroy Keith. One would forgive him at the moment, while all of this nonsense is being thrown about by the minister and the government, for keeping his head down and not expressing a personal view about any member of the board or the management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not hesitate to say that I have high regard for Leroy Keith. I am familiar with his background and his expertise. I am familiar with the job he is currently doing at CASA. I am familiar with the professionalism that he has brought to the Senate committees that he has an obligation to respond to in respect of questions asked. I think Leroy Keith is an effective and competent chief executive of CASA. He is particularly in charge of the ramp checks, the aircraft checks and all the other things that the organisation has to do. He is on the board of CASA and that advice is immediately available to the board when they want it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the intemperate and insupportable criticisms that have been made of this board, I want to refer to one other issue that needs to be canvassed&mdash;that is, Dr Clare Pollock. I do that I guess to appeal to the people who are reporting this entire affair. Dr Pollock has been lumped in with a general description of people who have no particular expertise in aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who knows anything about aircraft accidents knows that one of the major causes, if not the major cause, of aircraft accidents is the human failure&mdash;generically referred to as pilot error&mdash;and the systems failures. We have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so few aircraft accidents relatively speaking and flying is still far and away the safest mode of transport in the world because one of the things that marks out aviation disasters is that they are rarely caused by one or two things going wrong; they are usually caused by a whole sequence of events going wrong and then the odds shorten and shorten. It is when seven, eight, 10 or 15 things go wrong at the wrong time and at the wrong place that you have an accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principal skills required by the investigators at the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation are professional skills in systems failure. That is exactly what Dr Clare Pollock is an internationally recognised expert in. She is a systems failure expert. She has absolutely critical qualifications that are absolutely relevant to the job of being on that board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal level, I think it is about time somebody laid out fairly and clearly that she is one of the more highly qualified aviation experts on that board. I am sick and tired of the constant criticisms of her that she has no qualifications&mdash;something, I regret to say, that has simply been picked up and run unquestioningly by a number of journalists. I want to lay that down now. If you want to make that criticism of members of the board, please do not make it continually of Dr Clare Pollock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the board be comprised entirely of aviation experts? Of course it should not. That board, like any other board, needs a mix&mdash;the proper mix&mdash;of generalists and specialists on the board. Is it more important, for example, to have as the chair of the board an expert in aviation safety who may be a lousy administrator, or a professional administrator who is intelligent enough to be able to hear what is being said to him by the experts on the board, in particular by Leroy Keith, about those technical matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make absolutely no bones about my view on the issue. It is far better in my view to have an expert administrator in that position rather than somebody who has a degree in aviation engineering and may, therefore, only be an expert in that particular part of the aviation industry in which they are qualified.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1261">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you can have the best of all worlds&mdash;which is what you look for when you are appointing people&mdash;and find somebody who has a degree in law, a degree in aviation engineering, a commercial pilot's licence and everything else, that is fine. But you find a person like that. I could not when I was minister for transport. They are as scarce as hen's teeth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another difficult and proper problem that needs to be considered in terms of conflict of interests. That is, in drawing people from the aviation industry, you need to be very careful that the particular part of the aviation industry they come from is not then unfairly represented by them on the board. Who is as concerned about this as anyone else? The minister, of course, because the minister has gone on the public record attacking the Civil Aviation Authority for his concerns that their employees may have a conflict of interest in respect of companies they may have previously worked for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a proper concern too, but where else does the safety regulator get the test pilots and the check and training captains it needs, if not from the industry? Of course, that is where they must come from. It is simply then a question of ensuring that there is proper process and proper regard given so they do not get an opportunity to be in a conflict of interest&mdash;as much for their sake as for the safety of air regulation, I might add. If, for example, a particular person is drawn from a particular company and goes to work for the CAA, it is a sensible prohibition to ensure that that person is not directly involved in any decisions that involve the company they worked for or, if they are, that they are only in such a position as part of a group of people who are engaged in the same exercise and scrutinising that overview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the minister on the public record expressing his concern about that conflict of interest. That same problem applies to board appointments. You have to be careful that you do not take people from companies in which they may exercise some improper role afterwards. That is one of the reasons why you often look for people who are retired from direct involvement with companies. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why when I was transport minister, by extraordinary coincidence, I did appoint on one occasion two brothers to the board, one who had been a senior check and training captain with Ansett and the other who had followed an almost exactly parallel career path with TAA&mdash;not something you would find every day of the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to find people who have all of the necessary skills, do not have the conflicts of interest, will properly discharge the functions and so on. It is not altogether an easy task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In expressing again the same support we expressed for this legislation in June last year&mdash;and wondering why it has not been brought on before now if the minister wanted to appoint these two people&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and notes that the protestations of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) about the urgency of reconstituting the CASA Board are at odds with the fact that this bill has languished on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  since its introduction to the Senate on 28 June 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final paragraph (c) takes a commonsense position. Given the government's assertions on the public record, there is absolutely no logical reason why the government cannot support all of this second reading amendment. There is nothing in it which, firstly, is exceptional or, secondly, is in conflict with anything the government has said publicly on this matter. Indeed, every single paragraph supports the minister's assertions on the question of aviation safety and commonsense approaches to the appointment of board members. I look forward to getting the support of the Senate, including the government members of the Senate, for this second reading amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question follows: is it proper or are you likely to get a reasonable result if those who are to be regulated end up being the only ones who are directed towards being on the board? The answer quite clearly is no. If you do such a thing you are likely to get a skewed result right from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aviation safety is not just about pilots. Air safety is about the public&mdash;the public who fly, the public who are underneath air paths and the relatives of people in many different circumstances&mdash;and about the confidence 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people can have in an industry which is so vital to a country like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill unfortunately is yet another sad episode of the tragic tale of civil aviation in this country. The continuing tragedy has been played out in a political forum that seems to have little concern for the safety of the public who travel by air in this country, despite the rhetoric to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another example of the problems we will continue to face in Australia as we push for further deregulation and cost recovery, and lose further control of regulatory bodies. The message from the government and, to that extent, the opposition is clear: that we do not need enforceable regulation or regulation as we may have had it in the past; that competitive forces will force companies to maintain proper standards in areas such as safety. To my mind, this approach is naive in the extreme. It leaves the consumer open to massive risk in relation to safety and environmental standards, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, in areas such as aviation, we do need to regulate to ensure that the highest levels of safety are maintained. This is where we need to have properly established and accountable regulatory bodies, such as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The farcical situation that has arisen with CASA over recent months is a direct result of the politicisation of that body and the failure to have proper procedures and qualifications in place in relation to its board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, I am pleased to see that Senator Murray has proposed some amendments that address some aspects of my concerns. I believe that his proposal in relation to such issues as the qualifications of the board, merit as a basis for appointment, a limit to the number of terms that a board member can serve and the independence of the board is laudable. The Greens will be supporting his amendment to that effect during the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CASA board should not have been placed in the position in which it has found itself in recent times. I believe that the reforms proposed by Senator Murray, which I believe are consistent with the Nolan commit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1263"> tee report from the United Kingdom parliament, will go a long way towards avoiding this sort of debacle in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely important that we deal with this issue without this level of politicisation. At the moment I have some concerns about the proposal for the second reading amendment, and those concerns relate to lobbying. Lobbying can be many different things. People can lobby for very good reasons in relation to civil aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know&mdash;perhaps Senator Collins could advise me&mdash;whether there is some precedent for this; I would be happy to hear about that when it comes up&mdash;whether the fact that someone has spoken up or tried to change things in the past in relation to aviation safety should immediately bar them from participation on the board. That perhaps might mean in the future that anyone who has kept their mouth shut becomes eligible for a board and that there will be some sort of witch&hyphen;hunt in relation to whether or not anyone who has ever expressed an opinion has been classified as a lobbyist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is my reservation. It might be a `this means you, Dick Smith' amendment. But before I commit to whether or not we would be able to support it as a second reading amendment, I would like to see some more rationalisation for it when we come to the committee stage. But I shall leave that for further into the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to take a few minutes to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996. The purpose of this bill is quite simple, and it is outlined in items 3 and 4 of the schedule of the bill. These items amend section 33 of the principal act to provide for a deputy chairman to be appointed to the board of CASA. In addition, the maximum number of members who may be appointed is increased from three to four.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that I have had a great interest, a long and abiding interest in aviation. I have spoken on it on many occasions. It comes from an association of over 30 years as an aircraft owner and pilot and someone considerably involved in the maintenance of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those aircraft also. I think I have a broad view of the whole of the field. In my time here, as Senator Collins will aver, I have played no political favourites on this. I have been as critical of my own side of politics as I have been of the Labor Party of actions that have been taken that I think are contrary to the best interests of the nation and the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support this bill, not for any political reasons but because I believe the quality of the Civil Aviation Authority can be improved. We really do need the very best people we can get on the board of that authority because it is an enormously important field. It involves the lives of so many Australians and the commercial wellbeing of the country. All of us in the parliament are accountable to the community for aviation safety in so far as we have an influence on the legislation that goes through the parliament. And it is beholden on those of us who have an interest to speak in order to try to obtain the best results for the community that we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The catalyst for this body, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, was the disastrous accidents to two commuter airlines, Monarch and Seaview, in the immediate past. They led to the dissolution of the old Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;and it was not really an old authority as it had replaced the department of transport which, in turn, had overtaken the Department of Civil Aviation which had existed for many years. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think many of the changes administratively that the regulatory authority has suffered have contributed to the malaise within the industry because there has been very little stability and very little predictability in the careers of people. We have lost a lot of very capable professionals in the last 10 to 20 years from the regulatory authority that we simply could not afford to lose. I have a view that all those changes were rather precipitate&mdash;that they were the response to pressures of the time, both in relation to incidents within the industry and economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken on many occasions about the economic rationalism of the Labor Party and the way they applied, inappropriately, a user&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1264"> pays doctrine to aviation and how, in that process, they completely overlooked the public interest in having a safe and effective regulatory authority to provide safe commerce for people and for freight within Australia, and the great contribution that makes to Australia's economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not averse to the proposition, for example, that we disband the CASA, the Federal Airports Corporation and Airservices Australia and go back to an organisation which would be a department of state&mdash;such as the old Department of Civil Aviation. I would not want it to go back to the way the old DCA operated 10 or 20 years ago, but I think the public interest is so substantial in this area that there is a valid case to have a department of state where the parliament has direct responsibility for the actions of that department rather than the indirect pathways we have of setting up a series of government business enterprises at arms&hyphen;length from the government in the form of the CASA and the FAC. But that is a diversion for the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the point that the genesis of CASA was the tragic accidents that we experienced in the last few years with Monarch and Seaview. As a result of that, CASA was set up. When parliament approved the legislation to set up CASA, there was never any belief in the parliament that those who were appointed to the CASA board would not be people who had a great professional interest in and experience in aviation or cognate subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some surprise when people who had no apparent connection at all with aviation were appointed to that board. I have a bit of a liberal view about this. I think boards do have to represent wider interests rather than very narrow technical ones, for the very good reason that boards of organisations do not involve themselves in day-to-day running matters. The board does not, of itself, dictate the minutiae of how an organisation operates. That is left for the managing director or, in the case of CASA, for the chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board of any organisation should look to the future and should lay down broad principles and policies which the employees 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of that organisation should follow and work to. The actual composition of the board, in not having 100 per cent aviation experience on it, is not a great concern to me, but it is a concern when pretty well everyone on the board except for one member had no previous contact with aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a very strong critic of the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority and CASA in the past where they have not performed as well as they should have. But, having said that, in all fairness I have to say that, in the short life of CASA, they have made some improvements. They might not have moved as rapidly, as far or as fast as they should have, but I think the board of CASA have honestly tried to tackle the great problems that beset them in the regulatory field. I think that ought to be put on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will allow for additional members to the board of CASA. I would like to deal with the membership of the board of CASA, because it has been a matter of considerable public debate over the last few months. There is a need to have some members on that board who really have a handle on and a deep knowledge of aviation safety matters. This is not a field for well meaning amateurs to be involved in. You need people with a range of interests. You need people who have experience in the commercial world, because, at the end of the day, aviation is a commercial activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall economic value of aviation in Australia probably runs into billions, and the regulatory authority has to recognise that aviation operates in an economic environment. Therefore, you have to have people on the board who have sound business and commercial experience. You have to have people who represent the interests of the consumer&mdash;whether they are using the airlines to carry freight or the millions of people who fly on the airlines in Australia each year. Their interests have to be represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the heart of CASA is this business of aviation safety. As someone who has been involved in aviation for a very long time in a practical sense, I would not pretend to hold myself out as competent to sit on that board 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1265"> in a safety role. I think the sort of person you need for that is someone who has had a very extensive flying experience, probably someone who has been a qualified test pilot&mdash;that is the level of expertise that I think is appropriate&mdash;combined with experience of executive control of safety matters in a large organisation. There is a big difference between applying safety at a personal level and trying to enforce safety across an industry or across a nation. I believe we need somebody on the board with those qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been too keen on service personnel&mdash;army and air force officers or pilots&mdash;getting into the Civil Aviation Authority, because often they have not had the requisite commercial experience and take a rather scholarly or unworldly view to operations of aviation in a commercial sense. Regrettably, some of the people who apply from the services and who have had employment in the Civil Aviation Authority, or its predecessors, in the past have not been the very best of service pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a case like this, I think you can only go to a former senior air force officer to provide that safety oversight. There is no opportunity in private or commercial aviation for people to go through things like the Naval Test Pilot School in the United States, the test pilots school at Edwards Air Force Base for the USAF or the Empire Test Pilot School in the United Kingdom. Those opportunities are just not available to civilian pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While airlines such as Qantas and Ansett have an intensive safety program, they are always within the boundaries of that company themselves. It is really only in an organisation such as the air force that you have somebody who can get experience across the whole ambit of dealing with a large organisation and putting safety practices in place. I think someone with that experience is absolutely vital to have on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few words, I wish this bill a speedy passage. The only point I would like to comment on is Senator Collins's amendments to the bill. In subsection (a), he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the board should include members with backgrounds such as the law, regulation, general safety

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak briefly on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996. In doing so, I think the first thing that one needs to highlight is that in recent times we have heard a lot of trumpeting by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and huge indignation about the activities of the CASA board. One would have thought, from reading and listening to the minister, that the CASA board was ignorant, illiterate and totally incompetent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things the minister has recently been going on about has been the Falcon crash in Queensland. There have been lots of allegations about the incompetence of the CASA board and how they did not handle that correctly. We finally had the Wheelahan report tabled yesterday, which confirms that the CASA board had not done anything wrong. There were some things to answer, possibly on behalf of a CASA employee, but the CASA board had not done anything wrong. In relation to the employee, it stated that it was unclear whether any conflict of interest had arisen from the employment of that employee. The report concludes that there are some deficiencies in their new conflict of interest rules&mdash;and I understand that CASA is keen to correct that&mdash;but there is no criticism of the CASA board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report does, however, criticise the minister. The Wheelahan report is a report that the minister commissioned because he wanted to get the CASA board. His own report got him, because it criticises the minister for taking three months to reply to a letter in which queries about the safety of Falcon Airlines were raised. It also criticises the contents of the minister's reply. This is a minister who did not understand that the DPP is the one which takes the prosecutions; he was criticising other people for being slow and tardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears from the Wheelahan report that the minister is the one who has been doing that sort of activity. It is a witch-hunt by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1266"> minister. It is the only way to describe it. He thinks he doth protest too much, because it is now 5 March 1997&mdash;</PARA>

In fact, when he was the shadow minister, he was protesting. He has now had over 12 months&mdash;more than a third of their term of government&mdash;to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister acted fairly quickly. I think he got this bill into the House in late May last year. It has been in the Senate since 28 June. Since 28 June, what have we seen? We have seen the minister trailing around this countryside, belting the CASA board around the ears for all he is worth, indulging in every criticism that he could possibly dredge up. We have even had the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in this place describe one of the CASA board members as a welcome adornment to one of his boards that he might put her on. The minister has obviously not read the full meaning of the word `adornment', because it does relate to ornaments and things that beautify.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these attacks have done and what this tardiness on the part of the minister has done have, I fear, at least the potential to erode the confidence of the flying public in the safety of airline travel, and I think it probably has. That is of great concern. We saw comments last week in the press by James Strong from Qantas expressing concern about any erosion in confidence in airline travel and in airline safety. Qantas and Ansett have a world reputation in airline safety, as do a lot of other airlines in this country. The smaller airlines have been the ones that have gotten into trouble. It is the CASA board and the CASA authority that have been involved in monitoring that and in rectifying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say that there have been some airlines in regional areas of Australia that have gotten into trouble, there are also a lot of other airlines out there who are running very competent, very good services but they are running them in smaller aircraft. They are running them in nine seaters or 18 or 19 seaters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Qantas and Ansett can possibly withstand, without too much problem at all, the drop in passenger numbers of one or two passengers per flight but those smaller regional commuter airlines could not stand a drop of one or two passengers per flight because that goes immediately to their viability. These are good, reliable airlines. I fly them all the time. I fly with them more than I fly with the majors and so do a lot of other senators here. We know they are good, competent safe airlines, but I do not want to see the confidence in those services that those airlines provide eroded falsely due to the minister being out on a witch&hyphen;hunt after the CASA board because he wants to appoint his own people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enable him to appoint two more people to the board. He has had this bill on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> since 28 June last year and for seven or eight months the government has done nothing about introduc 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1267"> ing it. It just highlights the action of the minister as being nothing more than a witch&hyphen;hunt, being nothing more than a vendetta against individual people. But while he is conducting that vendetta I want to know and I want assurance from him that he is not doing anything which is going to undermine confidence in the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important industry to Australia. Many, many people in this country rely upon commuter and regional airlines for their transport methods. Yet the minister's actions have undermined confidence in the industry. We have heard that concern expressed publicly, as I say, by the chief executive of Qantas. This is something that is of grave concern to me. The minister has been tardy in ensuring the introduction of this legislation into the Senate. I think tardy is a fairly polite word to use here. But it has not stopped him from conducting this witch&hyphen;hunt, and this witch&hyphen;hunt is something he should be condemned most roundly for undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I do not want to see him, as a consequence of his deliberate act of conducting this witch&hyphen;hunt&mdash;and it is a deliberate act on his part to conduct this witch&hyphen;hunt&mdash;forcing or placing in jeopardy the viability of some of these smaller regional commuter airlines. As I say, if you are operating a five or six seater or even a nine seater or a 19 or 36 seater, the drop of one or two passengers has a huge impact upon your industry and your business. That then gets into consequential flow&hyphen;on effects of whether you are able to afford to fulfil your safety commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who is going to fly will of course fulfil their safety commitments but it will place extra stress and pressure on that airline. Often the principal of the airline is still involved in active flying. As Senator Collins said, pressure is one of the things that does add to the stress and strains in this industry and can actually add to accident rates. If any of these things happen they can be traced back to the deliberate actions of the minister. I think he is to be condemned for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the politicisation of this. We have seen one or two individuals, who have very close links to the coalition and who make significant donations to the coalition, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> take a very high public political stance on this. The amendment that the opposition is moving is designed to remove the possibility of people basically buying their way on to these sorts of boards. That is of grave concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: the minister is to stand condemned for his witch&hyphen;hunt of the CASA board when the Wheelahan report criticises him rather than the board. He is to be condemned for any erosion in confidence of airline safety in this country and the potential impacts and consequences that this may have.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a most important debate on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996 because it does not just go to the heart of a very political issue; it goes to the heart of probity and accountability in government and the boards which government appoints generally. In the defence and attack on this board lies the very heart of how this government will approach the defence and attack of all the boards within their power. It is very important, I think, that the Senate gives this government a message as to how we want to pursue these issues of board appointments in general. It is not for nothing that it has been an issue which has provoked extreme public and media debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must begin my speech by indicating that with regard to this issue I do have some experience, and it is experience I shall draw on. I have, unlike many members of the Senate, extensive experience in the operation of boards. I have sat on many boards as a senior executive, as a shareholder and as a community person. I bring to that a view I have as to the way in which boards shall operate. I think some of the remarks of Senator Bob Collins were apposite in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also bring some experience of aviation. The first experience was unfortunate, because I had many years of war service and had much to do with aeroplanes as a result. On the other side&mdash;which is also unfortunate because it gets to be a pain after a while&mdash;I have had decades of extensive air travel in all sorts of airlines, some of which I do not want to repeat. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1268">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should know that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the CAA bill with amendments that we will put up. The purpose of that bill is to allow the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to appoint additional members to the CASA board. We do not seek to interfere with that right. It is useful to enlarge the board. Five members is too small a number to cover all the ground this board and any board needs to cover. It is also appropriate that the increase is to an odd number. A board of seven is not too large and boards in my view should always be composed of odd numbers so that you do not have split votes and do not force the chair into a casting vote position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving a number of important amendments which have been overlooked in the debate so far and I will discuss these shortly. The background to this legislation unfortunately rests in the government's and minister's desire to fire the existing Labor appointed members of the board and to appoint Liberal appointees in their place. I have come to that conclusion reluctantly and I base that conclusion on the very unbalanced, biased and intemperate way in which this minister has pursued this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a problem and we should address it. The idea that any Labor appointment is bad or any Liberal appointment is good is nonsense. Some Labor appointments from the previous government were undoubtedly bad and some Liberal appointments from this government will undoubtedly be found wanting. We cannot attack people simply on the basis of by whom they were appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has done himself a disservice in the way in which he has pursued his objectives, because the objectives pursued by anyone else would have been appropriate, namely that the board does need to be enlarged, its skills and qualifications do need to be examined and the important way in which it operates does need to be opened up to further debate and improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives us the opportunity to decide what relevant expertise is needed and two things need to be said about this. Firstly, the minister's notion of what constitutes relevant expertise is awfully vague and may be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mistaken. Secondly, even if he is correct in assuming that the members of the board&mdash;and I have never mastered whether he means all the members, some members or just one member&mdash;lack appropriate skills, the approach that he has taken in dealing with the current board has not in my opinion been a model approach. Should the minister be able to force members of the board to resign? The problem with having appointments based purely on ministerial discretion which can be terminated when governments change, is that it opens the way for political patronage and continues a dreadful and unacceptable precedent. The Australian Democrats have opposed, will continue to oppose and will beg you to oppose this process of political patronage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also conflicts with the notion of having a statutory authority which is independent and at arms&hyphen;length from government. If this minister or any other minister is able to sack board members of statutory authorities at their own discretion, how can their independence be guaranteed? Of course he has not been able to sack them. He has therefore attacked them and has made every other board that the government controls and all their members nervous as a result&mdash;nervous of their independence, nervous of their tenure and nervous of their ability to be independent and to speak out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the USA, which does not have a democratic system I admire, with each change of administration everyone appointed to such public posts tenders their resignation. This paves the way for the new President and his ministers to appoint a long list of mates to such boards. Patronage is therefore effectively built into the United States system on the basis of, `If you can't beat them, let's join them.' I do not believe such a situation is appropriate for the USA or is acceptable for them. It is certainly not appropriate for Australia. It is not a path we should continue down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To some extent&mdash;and we are grateful to our predecessors in these various chambers&mdash;legislation has attempted to avoid overt executive control, unfettered executive discretion or unacceptable executive power. It is for this reason that the CAA does not allow the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1269"> minister to replace the board at his discretion. That does not mean that board members cannot be removed and this is why the minister himself has arrived in the situation where his own judgment and pursuit of this matter has been discredited. Because the act does quite properly enable the minister to sack the board if their performance has been unsatisfactory for a period of time or if they are identifiably incompetent. He has that power.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To date all we have got the minister to really focus his answers on is to accuse the board of inexperience and a lack of variation of skills. But the minister has not presented the details of specific decisions or instances where this inexperience has led the board into mistakes of judgment which have put air safety materially at risk.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, nor has he been remotely persuasive in supporting his argument that the current board is inexperienced and is guilty of worsening our air safety regime and, fortunately, the media and political commentators in this area have been sharp enough to pursue him on those grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister can demonstrate that the board's performance has been unsatisfactory, the relevant board member should be removed. The minister has not been able to make such a case; he has therefore left himself open to the strong allegation that political patronage is a major motive. I do not suggest for a moment that it is the only motive, because this bill does evidence some useful advances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If his intention is simply to create job vacancies so he can appoint mates&mdash;which is the motive that has been imputed&mdash;then he should back off the existing board and concentrate on the board he can legitimately change after June 1997, when most of this board's term is up. I have not understood the attack on these persons when their term expires in a few months: it really is not an issue of immediacy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister cannot demonstrate that the board's performance has been substandard&mdash;and we are yet to see any solid evidence&mdash;he must cease playing political football with the board and trying to score points that do nothing to further his legitimate concern for air safety in this country. I draw your attention to the Falcon Airlines inquiry report, which was tabled at my request in a parliamentary return to order yesterday. That is an instance where publication of a particular inquiry report was suppressed for far too long, and that has probably damaged some innocent people as well as rightly focusing on some people who did need to be focused on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What qualifications should board members have? The minister has repeatedly announced that both new appointees are to have practical aviation experience. Our suggestion is that the board should be viewed as a whole and that the minister's appointments should be looked at with a view to how that board should look after June and not how it should look after the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two things need to be said about practical aviation expertise. This requirement is not spelled out anywhere in the bill. I happen to agree that the board should include practical aviation experience but, if it is not spelled out in the bill, what happens if the next minister from another government or from another political party disagrees and appoints inappropriate people to the board? What it means is not spelled out anywhere else by anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us ask some silly questions. Does `practical aviation' mean the board members must be licensed pilots, have experience in aviation catering, be air stewards or aeronautical engineers, or merely have worked for an airline company for a number of years? Must they be enthusiastic amateur pilots? Mention has been made of a well&hyphen;known one. Can it be interpreted to mean that they can be highly experienced aviation passengers, such as the parliamentary secretary and I? The very fact that it can mean almost anything reinforces the fact that, unfortunately, it means almost nothing and gives each minister undue discretion. The Democrats have endeavoured to spell out those qualifications which we think are appropriate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1270">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can anticipate the arguments that it fetters the minister, that it will be too prescriptive and all those sorts of things. We throw the challenge to you: we are quite happy for you to put appropriate amendments in. We have listened carefully to the comments from the minister and from numerous experienced commentators in both the electronic media and the press media, and we have put together a check list of the appropriate qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also used my own experience on boards and my understanding of what boards are required to do&mdash;and we will make comments on this in the committee stage&mdash;by including the range of skills essential for a board to have to operate effectively in a very complex environment. It is extremely fortunate that we have Senator Collins, with his invaluable experience as a member of the former government and as a former minister for transport, participating in the debate, because it will give some substance and depth to our understanding of this issue. He has rightly made the point that board skills have to cover more than just aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree totally with the minister that the board members should be appropriately qualified. It is a most important admission by the minister, and an important advance in the debate. We would like to see all other ministers, and shadow ministers for that matter, acknowledge that all board members should be appropriately qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at the board's role and functions, and then determine the individual and collective skills that need to be reflected. We have given this much thought. We strongly believe a broad mix of skills is needed because the board is not only responsible for deciding safety objectives, strategies and policies to be pursued; it is also responsible for overseeing the running of CASA&mdash;and that means workers compensation, employee contracts, legal liability, fiduciary duties, financial accounting. It means all the normal things that go with board operation. Our proposed amendments will therefore seek to ensure the requirement to appoint appropriately qualified individuals on the board and to ensure that those qualifications are clearly spelt out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also tried to tackle the issue of independence. While the minister deplores the cool relationship that is presently said to exist between the industry and the regulator&mdash;although I can see a mutual respect, quite frankly, between the two in many of the utterances that are made&mdash;I fear that a swing too far in the opposite direction could be far worse. We do not want too warm a relationship, and the minister should be cognisant of that when he is dealing with the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliamentary Secretary, I will scrupulously keep away from personalities in this debate. I will not get involved with partisanship as to who I think should or should not be on the board. Frankly, I do not know the persons who have been put up as board nominees or who have been lobbying my own office for inclusion well enough, in terms of their qualifications or lack of them, to even begin to enter that debate. And I believe&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maintaining independence of the regulator from industry is imperative. The relationship between the regulator, whose primary duty is to protect fee&hyphen;paying customers, and the industry needs to be kept at arms&hyphen;length. Failure to do this could result in capture of the regulator by any industry or sector of industry. That would not be good for safety. I do not think anyone genuinely concerned about safety would disagree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having listened to the minister on many occasions, I am quite sure that the one thing he would absolutely hate to do is to appoint a board which would then oversee any detrimental situation of air safety which would rebound to his discredit. He must ensure that he and the board are at arms&hyphen;length from each other. For this reason, the Democrats will be moving an amendment designed to minimise the possibility of capture by any particular person or organisation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1271">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to note that the Democrats welcome the current review into the role of CASA and the civil aviation safety regulations and the input that industry organisations are making. Some commentators are fond of dismissing some of those organisations as bully boys or as self&hyphen;interested or sectional groups, but in their competing claims they are contributing to much more exposure of the issues that need to be debated and which the minister himself has quite properly brought to the public's mind. That continued participation by the various constituent organisations in the industry is important if we are to achieve a more effective and efficient aviation safety regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remark on Senator Collins's amendment. I indicate to the parliamentary secretary that we will support that amendment to the second reading debate but with the exclusion of the last three lines of paragraph (c) of that motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the notable things about the debate that has taken place so far in the Senate today on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill is the contrast between the manner of that debate and the way in which this issue has been handled by the Minister for Trans 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> port and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and by some sections of the industry in the public arena over the past 12 months or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have heard today from all sides of the chamber&mdash;I pay particular tribute to the contribution of Senator MacGibbon from the government and the comments just made by Senator Murray from the Democrats, as well as from my own colleagues&mdash;has been a reasoned, logical and constructive discussion about the particular issues of air safety and the operation of the CASA board. I listened with particular interest to the remarks made by Senator MacGibbon. For instance, I think there is a lot of merit in the comments he made about the need for both independence as well as expertise on the CASA board and in the area of air navigation and air safety. I felt that his suggestion that such qualities can be found in persons with air force experience was a good one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, Senator MacGibbon quite properly acknowledged that the make&hyphen;up of boards, whether it be in the area of civil aviation safety or any area, should never be confined simply to expertise in the particular area for which that board is charged with responsibility. It has long been recognised that in making appointments to boards of government instrumentalities there is a need to have a mix. Firstly, you do need expertise in the particular area that is under the control of that board, but you also need, for instance, to have regard to the importance of consumer representation and a range of other areas that may well be impacted upon by decisions of the board and by the conduct of that industry. I welcome those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the tenor of the debate here contrasts markedly with how this issue has been handled by the minister out there in the public arena. Other speakers have drawn attention to the fact that the minister has this obsession with removing a number of members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is quite clear that that obsession has blinded him to his responsibilities as a minister. For a start, it has been noted that the minister has at all times had within his area of control the ability to expedite this legislation, which has lain on the table for some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1272"> seven or eight months. He has known all along that the position of the opposition was that it would not oppose the legislation to expand the size of the board. He has had that opportunity but he has never taken it up until now, when we are debating the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that, if he was so concerned&mdash;if he had this genuine concern that there was an urgency about restructuring or adding people to the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority because of concerns about safety in the industry&mdash;he would have acted; he would have sought to get this legislation through the parliament as quickly as possible so that he could then make the necessary appointments. But he has not done so. He has gone on a public rampage attacking particular individuals. We all know who they are: the chair of the board at the present time, Justice Bill Fisher; Ms Gabi Hollows, who is the consumer advocate; Dr Claire Pollock and, of course, Mr Geoff Molloy. Justice Bill Fisher is a very experienced and highly regarded Chief Justice of the New South Wales Industrial Court.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you want to continue, Senator Macdonald, the disgraceful attack upon the judiciary in this country that other colleagues of yours in the National Party particularly want to engage in, go right ahead. You are clearly making idiots of yourselves out there in the public arena with the sort of attitude being adopted by the government that, if you do not like the message, then you get stuck into the messenger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the issues before the chamber at the moment, as I have said and as other speakers have acknowledged, the minister has at all times had the opportunity to get this legislation through the parliament quickly, but he chose not to do so. As Senator Murray quite rightly pointed out, the attack upon the board members is totally unjustified. The attack is based upon an argument that these individuals do not have experience or expertise in air navigation or air safety issues or in the aviation industry generally, and therefore they are not entitled to be on the board. In the case of at least two of those persons on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> board&mdash;Dr Pollock and Mr Geoff Molloy&mdash;they do have experience, substantial experience: in respect of safety issues in the case of Dr Pollock, and as a former pilot in the case of Mr Molloy. We all know that the ex officio member of the board is Mr Leroy Keith, a person of renowned expertise in this area. But the minister goes on and on and says he needed to get rid of these people. It was nothing more than a political vendetta which he commenced prior to the election of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator West quite rightly pointed out, the minister has been on this hobby horse, this obsession, since his time as shadow minister. I find it quite hypocritical that the minister is engaging in that sort of campaign. He is accusing members of the board of being incompetent on the basis that they do not have a particular level of experience or expertise in the aviation industry when, at the same time, he and many other ministers in the cabinet and in the ministry would never meet that same test. The fact is that hardly any of the ministers in the current government could claim to have any expertise or experience in the portfolio areas that they look after. At the end of the day, that is where the buck stops&mdash;it stops with the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge that there are some ministers who could claim to have a particular expertise based upon their previous profession or training in the area of the ministry that they look after. But, in general, the sort of complaint that this minister wants to make about Justice Fisher, for instance, or Ms Gabi Hollows is one which more clearly applies to many of those in the ministry. I do not notice any of those ministers putting their hands up to resign their commissions as ministers of the Crown because of lack of experience or knowledge. It is a pity that some of them did not consider that option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that a large part of this minister's campaign has been about getting rid of the particular individuals on the board that he does not like. He is also hoping to get the opportunity to appoint a few of his own mates. One person's name in particular has been out there in the public arena. I am quite prepared to name him: it is Dick Smith. Dick 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1273"> Smith himself has put his hand up. He said, `Look, I'm available. I want to be on the board.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bob Collins" NAMEID="UNKNOWN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UNKNOWN">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He wants to be chairman.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he would like to be chairman. If he can't get that, he probably wants to be deputy chair. I do not actually criticise Dick Smith for putting himself forward; he is entitled to lobby. But the real issue here is the fact that Mr Smith would come onto this board representing a specific vested interest in the aviation industry because of his undoubted membership of AOPA. Also, he is a person who has not been immune from criticism about his own previous role when he was on the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. We know that it was Mr Smith who pursued, quite vigorously, the policy of affordable safety&mdash;something that has been a matter of concern, particularly since the coroner's report on the Monarch disaster when that philosophy was criticised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only just prior to the election that Mr Smith publicly endorsed the election of a Liberal government. He did that not only by way of public comment but also by spending many thousands of dollars in advertising on behalf of the Liberal Party. So one has to question the motivation in all of this, especially when we consider the hypocrisy of this government, which constantly attacked the Labor government for some of the appointments that it made to boards whilst it was in office. So don't give us any lectures about this high moral ground that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government wish to place themselves on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make a few other points in the time remaining. As it has been acknowledged, the Civil Aviation Authority had a lot of problems. That has never been denied. Indeed, it was the Labor government minister who took steps to break up the old CAA. The responsibility for air safety was taken away from them and given to a specific board&mdash;namely, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The board of CASA was established in July 1995, and the area of air safety was separated from the other functions of the old CAA and given its own board because of the promi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nence and importance that needed to be attached to it. We also saw the establishment of Airservices Australia at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the constant public attacks by this minister on these board members, one would think that they had been in their board positions prior to the establishment of CASA. I think there has been a quite deliberate campaign to make the public believe that the current board members of CASA somehow bear responsibility for the incidents, the accidents and the negligence that occurred under the previous arrangements, and of course that is totally untrue. These people have been in office since only July 1995 and, as Senator Murray quite rightly pointed out, their terms expire in June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At all times the minister has had the opportunity to await the termination of their appointments and then proceed to make different appointments if he so desired. But what has he done? He has allowed this legislation, which will expand the size of the board to give it additional expertise, which he believed was so urgent, to sit, lay dormant, for seven months while he engaged in a disgraceful attack upon current board members and tried to create&mdash;I think in some cases he succeeded&mdash;a false belief in the community that these people are responsible for all the accidents that had occurred prior to their own appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West quite rightly said and I think other senators have noted that we in this country have a proud record overall for air safety. We are fortunate to live in a country where flying conditions are fairly stable. We do not suffer the extremes of heat and cold that other parts of the world experience. Of course, that fortunate circumstance has contributed to the fact that, by and large, we have a fantastic record for safety. There have been problems in the past. That has been recognised, is being addressed and should continue to be addressed properly within the bodies established to look after this area. It should not be in the public arena as a slanging match between vested interests in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose members of parliament more than most can attest to the fact that we have an excellent safety record, both domestically and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1274"> when Qantas and Ansett fly overseas. I am sure many members of parliament could recount incidents of where they have flown on airlines in other countries and would attest to the fact that we have the highest of standards when it comes to comparisons with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, is not in any way to suggest that we can be complacent. We cannot be. But the minister has certainly been complacent. He has been lacking in his responsibility to get this legislation through the parliament. It should have been done ages ago. Fortunately, it is now before the parliament. As I said, I think we are now getting a constructive debate on the issue rather than the public slanging match we have had in the past. I support the legislation in conjunction with the amendment that has been moved by my colleague Senator Bob Collins.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out something by way of explanation because the motion moved by Senator Bob Collins, as amended by the Australian Democrats, refers to the minister having in some way been tardy in getting this legislation before the Senate. I think Senator Collins knows as well as I do that the minister has been very keen to get this legislation debated. When I took over the job of Manager of Government Business in the Senate, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development was one of the first people to knock on my door and ask, `When the hell are you going to get this CASA legislation dealt with?' He not only knocked on my door but also bailed me up at airport lounges and rang me regularly. Mr Wallis, who is in the advisers box today, rang me regularly. I even bailed up Senator Bob Collins behind the partition behind you, Madam Deputy President, and suggested to him that we get it dealt with quickly and

So he is very happy it is here. I have worked assiduously to make sure that it got here.

That is a serious matter, because the minister has tried to get this dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment is the other matter I would like to deal with. The coalition clearly would prefer there not to be a second reading amendment, but Senator Murray's motion to delete all words after `new appointments' in paragraph (c) does take out most of the most objectionable parts of that other motion. As I said, we would prefer not to support the motion at all because we think that, effectively, it is a restatement of either the reality or the law, certainly in paragraph (b) and the bit of paragraph (c) that remains.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Thank you for your assistance, Senator Collins. I will deal with amendment 1 first. It is important to note that there are precedents for this kind of spelling out, if you like, of qualifications required. I think the Wool Board, for instance, has the qualifications spelt out.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bob Collins" NAMEID="UNKNOWN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UNKNOWN">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aviation or aeronautical engineering?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. We have done that quite deliberately. We have done this spelling out of the various qualifications `relevant to or experience in'&mdash;and, Senator Collins, you must note the word `or'; it is not a prescriptive or restrictive amendment&mdash;deliberately because of the very strong case the minister has publicly made as to the qualifications and experience he wants on the board without really spelling it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can deal with paragraph (a) of the amendment first. We have indicated that it is important that there is a person on the board who understands safety systems and practices, preferably in relation to aviation. Boards, generally speaking, have to react to proposals put to them by senior executives of the organisation. Since safety is the raison d'etre of the CASA board, it is vital that they do have people on that board with experience in safety systems and practices able to judge the issue appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shadow minister Tanner correctly made the point that companies such as BHP do not necessarily have welders on their boards. But you can be very sure that, given the nature of that company, they have engineers on their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1276"> board so that, when their executives come to them with proposals, they have people with substance and ability able to rebut or to question in an informed, experienced and qualified manner. I cannot conceive the CASA board ever excluding the requirements in paragraph (a).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the mover of the amendment, I should make clear to Senator Bob Collins that our intention is that paragraph (b) of the amendment not be read as `aviation, or aeronautical engineering'; it is aviation engineering or aeronautical engineering. I am told by those who are intelligent in these matters, which I am not, that that can mean a different kind of engineering background and qualification. That is the reason aviation engineering or aeronautical engineering is included there. Since so much of safety depends upon structural matters and an understanding of the structural nature of aircraft, you need people who have an engineering understanding. Once again this goes to the very heart of the case the minister has made, but has failed to specify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (c) of the amendment is expressed as `flying aircraft'. In other words, persons with experience in the matter of flying aircraft should be on the board. That can be a very broad field. Plainly, if you are going to be involved in matters of aircraft safety, it is quite helpful to have people who understand that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have people advising you in life who have got no experience in matters whatsoever. I am reminded of Catholic priests who might advise you on matters of matrimony. I have always thought that was an extraordinary thing for them to do. So there are instances in life where people do advise you in areas in which they have no experience, but I think that is inappropriate in this board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (d) of the amendment is `consumer advocacy, preferably in relation to aviation'. This board is primarily but not exclusively concerned with the safety of fee paying passengers. The needs of those passengers, the needs of consumers, have to be taken into account. The previous government recognised that. We wish the current government to recognise that. It is a very important, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriate and public recognition of a community need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (e) of the amendment is `administration, preferably in relation to a regulatory body'. The point was made I think in the second reading speech that it is vital that administration is understood, that a person who is on the board understands the mechanisms, the methods, the shortfalls and the pitfalls of operating in a regulatory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (f) of the amendment is `financial management or accounting'. Any board which has to deal with the financial matters that are the province of the board has to have someone on it with a financial management or accounting background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard in previous debates and in the media the concept of affordable safety discussed. Somebody who is dealing with affordable safety needs to know what the balance sheets, cash flows and prospects look like of the airlines which are affected by safety decisions which have a financial outcome. Somebody who has to determine the resource needs of the organisation needs to understand the financial consequences of how all that works and to relate to and react to the proposals of what may sometimes be a self-serving executive or employee who puts a proposal to the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (g) of the amendment is `law' and relates to the liabilities which attach to this very important field. No board is without legal advice, simply because of the fiduciary duties and the liabilities which pertain in operating any organisation. They are particularly important in matters of air safety, where the compensation claims and the legal claims can be extremely onerous and extremely difficult. It is very unwise to have a board which does not have someone on it with legal background and experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For paragraphs (a) to (g) of the amendment we have said that persons should have qualifications relevant to, or experience in, one or more of those fields. If you look at existing members of the board and take somebody like Mr Keith, who is the head of the executive, you can see that he could fit into a number of those categories and that is so for almost any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1277"> appointment that has been publicly put or for appointments which have already been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this throws out all the politics and the claims that the members of the board are not experienced enough or not capable enough. This clearly spells out, but with wide enough discretions, to the minister the constituency of the board. I urge strongly that this amendment be supported. I am grateful to Labor for indicating their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The listing of the skills needed on a board is not a novelty. It is actually highly desirable. As I said, it is influenced for us by the Wool International Act, which has a comprehensive scheme governing selection and appointment of members. The amendment has a precedent and should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of `on the basis of merit' in our amendment No. 2 should not be necessary but, regrettably, because of the patronage assertions, questions of bias and the inference of mateship in the appointments of persons to the board, we would urge that this amendment be accepted. It should not even have to be here but it needs to be here. Perhaps the minister himself does intend to make his appointments on the basis of merit. If he does intend that, I cannot possibly see how the government could oppose this amendment No. 2. To oppose it would be just the most extraordinary thing I have ever heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to amendment No. 6. Once again, I could not possibly see how the government could oppose this one because it simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making appointments, the Minister must ensure that the balance of interests on the Board is such that no one interest may dominate the Board or derogate from its independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Plainly, the government would not like to see any board captured by an organisation or persons, because that would rebound to the detriment of the ability of that board to act independently and of the minister to rely on its considerations. Whilst I might expect some debate from the government on amendment No. 1, in my opinion amendments Nos 2 and 6 are extremely supportive of the government having a board which is capable of doing its job.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will be opposing all of the amendments that are currently before the Senate. I think Senator Murray quite adequately explained the reasons we would do so during his speech in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is not appropriate to be so prescriptive, to effectively create a check list in the legislation as to the sorts of people and qualifications that are required to go on this board. The coalition, prior to the election and virtually every week since then, has said that we are committed to appointing people with relevant aviation experience to this board. This legislation proposes to do that. We do not think that it is necessary to say that the appointment needs to be made on the basis of merit. The alternative proposition to that is that you might prescribe in the legislation that the appointment be made only on the basis that the person being appointed was an utter dill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, when someone has got to the position of a minister of the Crown in the federal government, there are enough checks and balances on that minister to ensure that he or she makes an appointment on the basis of merit without telling the minister in legislation that he or she has to do that. That is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1278"> to say that ministers in the past have not appointed to boards people who were inappropriate or even dills. That may from time to time happen. I am not aware of that, but it probably has happened. But we regard it as entirely unnecessary to say that the appointment needs to be made on the basis of merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 1 moved by Senator Murray is far too prescriptive. We believe that the minister should not be fettered in this way in making appointments, particularly when you read amendment No. 1 with amendment No. 3. I am very pleased to see the opposition will not be supporting amendment No. 3. If you took the two of those together, it would become extremely prescriptive and would tie the hands of the minister in making sensible judgments about the balance of the board&mdash;judgments on not only the experience of members of the board but also the balance and the other capabilities, the characters of the people involved and how the personalities of the board would work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray did make a very good point about his own experience on boards. The former minister Senator Bob Collins would know from his own long experience that when it comes to boards you have to have leadership and the right balance of leadership. The best boards always work when there is a spirit of teamwork, where the various skills, experiences and characters of those people meld together to achieve a good outcome for the area where they have responsibility. It is very hard to get that balance and this legislation seeks to give us a better chance to allow that to happen in the future with this very important board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Collins and all other senators, we have an intense vested interest in matters of air safety. I think it was Senator Collins who pointed out to the Senate a few years ago that he had inquired of one of Australia's major airlines as to who was the most travelled passenger in Australia. I think he found that he came out on top with that airline and that I was the second most travelled in that particular year. As Senator Collins and I know&mdash;as does my friend Senator Murray&mdash;coming from Western Australia or the Northern Territory, in particular, you are able to get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the top of that particular ratings table in Australia fairly easily.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Mr Chairman: Senator Murray, it is for those reasons the coalition is opposed to these matters. Ultimately, the processes of the cabinet which must be gone through to get nominations brought forward for these sorts of boards are quite rigorous, and Senator Collins particularly would know this from his own experience. In my own short experience in government where I have had to recommend appointments to various boards&mdash;and I have had to deal with the Antarctic Science Advisory Board and a couple of others&mdash;the process is most rigorous. Certainly in relation to this board, that process would be rigorous also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to tying the hands of the minister with this legislation, as I said to you, Senator Murray, the indication that the Senate has now given to the minister by way of the second reading amendment gives him a very clear view of the Senate's intention there&mdash;a motion that was passed without opposition. As I put to you privately, I would have thought that is the sort of direction the Senate representing the people of Australia might give to a minister. But to do so in a bit of black and white prescriptive legislation, I think, is against the interests of achieving an aviation board that will serve the best interests of the travelling public of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, the minister has made some statements which do need to be challenged. If it is too prescriptive to have seven qualities, from which a person needs only one or perhaps two&mdash;and preferably more, I suppose&mdash;to be sought for board membership, one wonders what the rationale is for seeking to dismiss members of the board because they do not have particular attributes. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1279">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case, if you have ministers seeking to dismiss members not because of, presumably&mdash;and I have not heard the argument&mdash;their performance as individual members of the board but because it is assumed they are lacking certain qualities, then it seems bizarre to have that being done in a de facto way without mentioning those qualities which are considered to be necessary in making up a board that will perform this very important function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might be able to take this as an issue: that it ought to be said it is too prescriptive to indicate what qualities might be useful on such a board&mdash;and that does not mean this is the be-all and end-all of what qualities might be useful. But it does seem to be hypocritical for people to be, if you like, hunted out of the board for not having certain qualities when there are no lists or guidelines of what kind of qualities are necessary for this very important issue of safety.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond quickly. I think that in a way Senator Margetts helps me to make the point that we are not, I would hope, trying to revisit matters of controversy over the last couple of weeks. We are putting in place a bit of legislation that, based on the trouble we have had getting this legislation up on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> , is not likely to come back here for a while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event that you would want to come back here and have a sort of rolling checklist of the kind of people you might want on the board is exactly why the government is opposed to it. We do not want that. We believe that the minister has the responsibility of appointing that board, under the relevant acts and under acts that apply to all statutory authorities; and that the minister, through the cabinet process and through his accountability to the parliament, is required to do that and is accountable for those decisions. That is the appropriate process to go through, without giving him a prescriptive black&hyphen;letter law checklist or menu to choose from. That just should not be necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to respond briefly to the point that Senator Margetts made, and also to agree with a point that Senator Campbell made earlier. I guess, as someone who has been in the position of having to do the job of finding people for boards, I have to say that it is often a difficult job. I can remember that when I was minister for transport the then secretary of my department, a highly competent and well experienced bureaucrat, spent an inordinate amount of his own personal time headhunting for boards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do wish to agree with Senator Campbell that, by and large, the process that is gone through in terms of making selections for boards is indeed rigorous and often difficult in trying to get all of the combination of skills you need. Senator Campbell said, again correctly, that one of the things you also have to give some regard to is the personalities, not just the expertise, of the people you are putting on a board because you do have to have a group of people who can work together. That is why leadership qualities, particularly of the chair of these boards, are important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell made another point earlier: if you combine one with three&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;it is putting a degree of constraint on any minister in a real world that would be literally, Senator Murray, with respect, almost impossible to achieve. We are supporting one because, having considered carefully all of the areas that have been laid down, we think that the kind of people whom you wanted, if they were not technical experts, would probably arguably at least be able to claim some expertise in areas of administration, financial management, accounting or so on, and you could get from the field of candidates sufficient qualified people. But if you were to apply the constraint of amendment No. 3 as well, I just think it would be creating a task for any government and any minister that would literally be impossible to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted with some interest the concern that Senator Campbell raised&mdash;rightly&mdash;of not having dills on boards. I think that is import 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1280"> ant. Perhaps Senator Campbell could suggest moving a no dill clause in respect of the board. But perhaps it might be fairer&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do agree with Senator Campbell. With greatest respect to Senator Murray, I am actually asking him to give some consideration to withdrawing amendment No. 3 because I can assure Senator Murray that to make it prescriptive&mdash;as amendment No. 3 does&mdash;that you actually have to have on a board of six people, with an ex officio chief executive, every single one of the qualifications from (a) to (g), is putting a task in front of a government or a minister that is literally impossible to fulfil.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> destabilise firstly Premier Brown&mdash;and successfully so&mdash;and now Premier Olsen can best be described not as a leak but as a flood. For the three years of the Brown government, the leaking to Labor leader Mike Rann and other Labor MPs was led and orchestrated by the present Premier John Olsen and former Liberal leader Dale Baker. These ministers led a group of ministers and MPs in the state Liberal government who together undertook a vendetta in an organised campaign designed to grab the Liberal leadership from Dean Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The losers have been the South Australian people. While this rabble of a government has been fighting each other, they have not been fighting for South Australia. While they have been busily plotting to destabilise the premier, they were taking their eyes and attention off their main responsibility&mdash;to run the state in the interests of South Australians. They have seen their positions in government as personal fiefdoms from which to conduct intensive warfare. While all of this has preoccupied their attentions, first Premier Kennett and now Treasurer Costello have stripped the state of much needed economic resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been two waves of leaking. The first wave was conducted by the people I have just revealed. The second wave was conducted by some whom I am not, as yet, able to identify. Mike Rann, of course, can identify the leak. It has been said in recent days that he is prepared to do so in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn for the moment to the second wave to get a real idea of the magnitude of the warfare that is going on. In recent days the Labor Party has received&mdash;in what is, without doubt, the biggest confidential leak in South Australian political history&mdash;750 pages of information about the water privatisation deal South Australians did not want. We were also given cabinet submissions, the minutes of cabinet subcommittees, private internal memos between ministers and between political staff, opinions of Crown solicitors and the Solicitor-General and confidential advice from CEOs to their ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most important thing we have received recently was the taxpayer funded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1282"> polling about the water privatisation deal. Both John Olsen and Dean Brown knew of the polling and yet denied the existence of the poll even though Olsen wrote to Brown about it just months before the matter was brought up in parliament. Both of them misled parliament and misled South Australians, and that is probably the only thing they have done together in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The polling shows that no-one wanted our water sold to the French and the British, but John Olsen, believing he knew best&mdash;arrogance at most&mdash;did it anyway. He spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars trying to convince South Australians that the deal would be good for us. We all said we did not want it, and we kept saying we did not want it, but John Olsen did it anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if that were not enough, the documents also showed that there had been a serious breach of probity in the handling of the water contract. I have spoken about that before. Although the government had been informed, Olsen and Brown did not order an inquiry into this until months later when evidence from witnesses before a select committee of the parliament of South Australia forced them to do so. Mike Rann was also given information relating to the business activities and land deals made by former Liberal leader Dale Baker while he was minister. I must say that this leaking is continuing. It continued last weekend and continued even up until Monday of this week. The beast that is the South Australian government continues to bleed a slow death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn back to the first wave&mdash;the wave for which Olsen and Dale Baker are responsible. These latest leaks are only a culmination of three years of leaking, which was designed to damage Mr Brown's standing in the community, the media and parliament within his own party. The senior Liberals I mentioned provided information to the Labor Party about Catch Tim Ltd and the Moriki financial scandals that rocked the Brown government in early 1995. We received information telling us that political donations were being laundered through shelf companies in Hong Kong to disguise the true source of the donations. One Liberal MP even drafted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> questions for the opposition to ask in parliament in order to embarrass Dean Brown. That is about as low as one can get.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just named two of them, Senator. I have just named Olsen and Dale Baker. I do not know why you were not listening. One Liberal MP drafted questions for the opposition. Liberal MPs also gave material to the state opposition about the government's proposed sale of the state forestry assets and, more recently, buckets of information designed to undermine Dean Brown's attempts to sack the Adelaide city council. Damaging information about the premier's information technology outsourcing contract with EDS was also given to the opposition over many months until just days before Dean Brown was deposed as premier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the vendetta of serial leaking had one objective, and that was to get rid of Dean Brown. That was successful. The opposition in South Australia revealed the existence of documents that showed that the former premier had misled parliament about the level of subsidies offered by the MFP to establish a head office at Technology Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This first wave of information had been leaked because of enormous personal battles between individuals and the state government. It reflects a childish inability to govern the state. They are not responsible enough to govern themselves, let alone to govern South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of the leaking was ever motivated by a concern for the people of South Australia; it was based on internal hatred and motivated by a desire to overthrow the previous Premier Dean Brown. This sort of bickering is irrelevant to the lives of most South Australians, but the information that was provided to us was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Olsen is not Premier because he is capable and honest, because over recent years he has shown he is none of those, nor is he loyal. He is Premier because he, together with Dale Baker, continually leaked destructive information to the opposition in a vicious campaign against Dean Brown. It is no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1283"> wonder that Dean Brown now still believes that he can and should return to the top job. He is busily calculating who will be left in his parliamentary Liberal Party after the election and who will vote for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for South Australians&mdash;while this has been going on for the last three years, while the main protagonists in the South Australian government have been slogging it out day after day, month after month&mdash;no-one has been fighting for South Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1283"><TITLE>Australian Workers Union</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this afternoon's debate I will discuss recent media attention given to the Australian Workers Union and its troubles in Queensland your home state, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds. In particular, I refer to Mr Bill Ludwig's, the AWU Queensland Secretary,  cashing in of his long service leave which exceeded $100,000. When I first read the media reports I was convinced that they could not be true. I knew there was a law against such behaviour. The Queensland Industrial Relations Act 1990, section 249 states, as an introduction, `[No payment in lieu]'. The section reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except upon termination of an employee's employment, an employer is not to make, and an employee is not to accept, payment in lieu of long service leave.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You could not get much clearer than that. This section of the Queensland Industrial Relations Act, which is mirrored in similar legislation all around this country, is held up by Labor and the trade union movement as a shining example of what the Labor movement has achieved for its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that long service leave and the outlawing of cashing it in is one of the hard fought gains that Labor claims, I thought it impossible that Mr Ludwig&mdash;a Queensland Labor power broker, Queensland Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, National President of the Australian Workers Union, Vice President of the ALP, a member of the ALP National Executive with direct links into Mr Beazley's office through Wayne Swan, the defeated member for Lilley and would&hyphen;be senator&mdash;could countenance any employer or employee breaching such a fundamental 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> principle. Yet that is exactly what he did for his own personal benefit, a benefit of $103,269.88.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to you that, but for seeing the actual documentation, the letters written by Mr Ludwig and the letters to Mr Ludwig enclosing the cheque, I would not have believed the information, nor would I have got up in this parliament to have raised this issue. I have seen the correspondence dated 28 March 1996 signed by Mr Ludwig to Mr Ian Cambridge, the Joint National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ludwig cashed in his superannuation, a benefit not available to any of his members who pay him his salary, which is in excess of $61,000. I understand the union rules may allow Mr Ludwig to cash in his superannuation. If he can, why can't all his members? Why did Mr Ludwig and the trade union movement fight to disallow this benefit to their members and then draft union rules to give themselves that benefit? It is ironic that Mr Ludwig got his cheque for $103,269.88 by a letter dated 1 April 1996, April Fool's Day. Mr Ludwig clearly has fooled his membership and has laughed all the way to the bank with his $103,269.88.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this a bit more concerning is that after Mr Ludwig got his payment there was another request from officials to cash in their superannuation benefits. All of a sudden four officials, all undoubtedly acting independently of each other, requested on 3 December 1996 to cash in their superannuation benefits, relying on the bizarre rules of the AWU which are in conflict with the Queensland legislation&mdash;section 249 of the Industrial Relations Act, as I have indicated to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did all these officials decide on the very same day that they would want to cash in their superannuation benefits? Undoubtedly they came to that conclusion independently, without discussing it with anybody and just decided it would be a nice thing to do. It is strange that if we have a look at the requests of all these officials we find that all their written requests are dated 3 December 1996. Those officials are: R. Slater, who got $91,884.41; B. Meiklejohn, $94,851.47; W. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1284"> Paton, $101,086.28; and K. Goding, $108,442.72. All the cashing in was in excess of $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did they all decide on the same day to cash in their benefits? That question I simply pose rhetorically, but it looks as though there must have been some discussion between the officials concerned. Were they concerned that union rules may shortly be changed to bring them in line with the long service leave rules in the Industrial Relations Act of Queensland? Once again, I simply ask that question rhetorically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder if Mr Ludwig and his officials are going around to their membership saying that the privileges of union officials ought be extended to the membership&mdash;chances are not. And chances are that is why Mr Ludwig's personal request to cash in his superannuation was in fact headed `private and confidential'. He clearly did not want his membership to know what he was up to. If it was clearly an entitlement that he felt comfortable with, that the union rules provided for, that it was all above board, why on earth would he be concerned that his request be dealt with in a private and confidential way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the very fact that I, as a Liberal senator, have been provided with this documentation indicates there are some very real concerns about the state of the AWU in Queensland. There are other aspects of this Labor doyen's activities which have been asserted to me but I am not willing to go into those allegations as there is no supportive evidence as yet provided to me. But if that supportive evidence does materialise, I look forward to making a further contribution in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Workers Union is in a mess. Its direct link with the Labor Party, the shared office holder status of Mr Ludwig in the AWU and in the ALP, raises the question about Labor's concern for propriety. It raises questions about Labor's integrity and its internal mechanisms for dealing with allegations of this kind. It raises questions also as to why Mr Swan, who is so closely associated with Mr Beazley, is, as I understand it, actively involved in Mr Ludwig's re&hyphen;election

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on the parliamentary record my continuing concern about the circumstances surrounding the recent appointment of a new chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council because I think it is a matter of public interest. I am not so much concerned with the lack of accountability or transparency in the appointment process or with the government's failure to adequately respond to legitimate concerns that have been raised about the political interference in that process. That is not the focus of my remarks today&mdash;my views on that are already on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to concentrate on allegations which were made in the Senate in relation to Professor John Funder, the preferred candidate of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for the position, whose nomination was rejected by cabinet in what can only be described as extraordinary circumstances. In this chamber last week, Senator Harradine, in response to a question from Senator Brown, tabled a letter from Dr Andrew Hapel which Senator Harradine said he had given to the government in support of his objections to Professor Funder's appointment as the NHMRC chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine also alleged that the then director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Professor David Curtis, was critical of Professor Funder's performance in reporting on the application of the Stephen committee report to the John Curtin School of Medical Research. In effect, Senator Harradine put on the record allegations made by two people who were, rightly or wrongly, disgruntled by something Professor Funder had allegedly done. Senator Harradine says he passed on these concerns to the minister, presumably in addition to the concerns that he had raised earlier with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is that Professor Funder was given no opportunity to respond to these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1285"> particular allegations prior to cabinet rejecting his nomination. From media reports we can see that the Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Williams, did take the extraordinary action of asking Professor Funder to respond to Senator Harradine's concerns. I must say that there is still no satisfactory public explanation as to how or why Mr Williams became involved, although I suspect it was very likely that the Attorney&hyphen;General was behaving honourably and giving Professor Funder an opportunity to refute some of Senator Harradine's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Professor Funder was not made aware of the specific allegation being made against him by Doctor Hapel, through Senator Harradine. Professor Funder told the Attorney&hyphen;General he was only aware of two occasions on which Senator Harradine had voiced his concerns. On the first of these occasions, in 1992, Senator Harradine's concerns had been voiced in the context of the NHRMC's record in funding research into embryo experimentation. On the second occasion, in 1994, Senator Harradine's concerns revolved around his view that Professor Funder was a supporter of RU 486.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not need to go into Professor Funder's very strong defence of his position in relation to these matters. The point I want to concentrate on is that concerns about Professor Funder's recommendations in relation to the John Curtin School of Medical Research were not raised with him. Neither was the letter from Dr Hapel which had, according to Senator Harradine, been passed on to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Hapel's letter is dated 28 January 1997 and Professor Funder's response to the Attorney&hyphen;General is dated 14 February 1997. Maybe the Attorney did not know about the letter or these additional concerns. Maybe the minister did not know about them at this time. I accept that that is quite probable. But these issues concerning the John Curtin School of Medical Research certainly seemed to have miraculously bubbled up to the surface when it became apparent that there was not a lot of support around for the notion that the moral beliefs of the chair of the NHMRC were apparently a more important selection criteri 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on than his scientific and medical qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that Dr Hapel's letter is addressed: `To whom it may concern'. I think that is a little odd in the circumstances and something which does raise questions as to whether Dr Hapel initiated this action or whether he was approached to do so. Whatever the circumstances, my concern is that Professor Funder knew nothing of Dr Hapel's letter until it was tabled in the parliament by Senator Harradine. I think that is a fundamental breach of natural justice, and it is one which I seek to rectify today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek leave to table a section of a letter from Professor Funder to the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University&mdash;the section that deals only with references to Dr Hapel. I will have to adjust the documentation before I do it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dated 18 November 1991, it contains Professor Funder's actual report on the discussions he had with the staff of the John Curtin School of Medical Research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report shows that Dr Hapel is being a bit loose with his facts when he states in his letter&mdash;the letter used by Senator Harradine&mdash;that Professor Funder recommended that Dr Hapel not be offered an NHMRC fellowship because of his poor eyesight. What Professor Funder in fact recommended&mdash;as we can see in this excerpt&mdash;was that Dr Hapel should be offered an NHMRC fellowship subject to his undergoing appropriate medical evaluation so that he and the John Curtin School of Medical Research could be assured that his continuing to work at the bench `is not only possible but does not endanger himself or those around him'. In other words, he did not say, `Don't give this man a fellowship because of his eyesight.' He said, `Give this man a fellowship subject to his having his eyesight tested.' That is a very different thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Funder made no secret of the fact that he had not been able to interview Dr Hapel. He said so in his report. He said Dr Hapel's eyesight `appears to have deteriorated' but he did not recommend&mdash;as Dr Hapel in his letter tabled by Senator Harradine asserted&mdash;that Dr Hapel should not be offered a fellowship because of his poor eyesight. Professor Funder did not&mdash;as Dr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1286"> Hapel asserted in his letter&mdash;attempt to prevent Dr Hapel from being awarded an NHMRC fellowship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have here is someone who was disgruntled with something Professor Funder was perceived to have done, and that person's views were given to the minister by Senator Harradine, tabled in parliament, and Professor Funder has no opportunity to respond to them. I do not pretend to know all the circumstances surrounding Professor Funder's report. Neither, I suggest, does Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Dr Hapel's view of events is an understandable one, but it is certainly an incorrect one, which is now on the record. It is an incorrect one in view of the content of Professor Funder's report. I do not think any of us has any objection to any senator, or Senator Harradine, passing on Dr Hapel's letter to the minister. That is his prerogative; it is our prerogative. What I have a problem with is that, at a critical stage in the appointment process, Professor Funder, the health minister's nominee, never got a chance to refute Dr Hapel's version of events. Whether the complaint of this one person was or should have been sufficient to raise questions about Professor Funder's appointment as the NHMRC chair is apparently something we will never know, given the government's almost pathological reluctance to discuss the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am doing today is simply placing additional facts on the parliamentary record&mdash;facts which Professor Funder should have been given an opportunity to present himself. Since I have been speaking, I have been able to ascertain through my staff with Professor Funder that this entire letter is a public document. Therefore, I do not need to excise any elements of it. I wish to table the entire letter, which I understand has been shown to representatives in the chamber. I seek leave to do so.</PARA>

I know that you cannot win; I know that no&hyphen;one can win gambling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mind that the opportunity is available to people in casinos and elsewhere. What I object to is the intensifying pattern in my home state of Victoria for advertisements, false advertisements, on television showing how you can win gambling. We in Victoria have all seen them. I am not sure what happens in Queensland, Senator O'Chee's state. We have got all the TAB ads. The blokes are playing golf and one bloke pulls the covers off and there is a new set of Cobras. And they all gasp in amazement: how did he possibly get those? And he knocks the ball 280 metres down the fairway. Of course, they are Cobra clubs and he won them at the TAB. On the ads go: taking the spouse off to a restaurant and shocking the waiters by pulling cash out; gazumping the yuppie stockbrokers by saying, `I had a 15,000 per cent return from a bet at the TAB.' And on they go. There are now the ads for poker machines, with people winning jackpots. There are the ads for the casino, there are the ads for Lotto&mdash;all showing winners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1288">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they were fair, they might like to go and film those who have had to join Gamblers Anonymous. They might like to go to those who have done their money. The fact is that in lotteries, the state and the operator take 41 per cent of the take straight off the top. The TABs take 15 to 17 per cent straight off the top. The only gambling game worth playing in Australia is blackjack, with a 98.7 per cent return to the punter. That is why the blackjack tables are disappearing, other than for high rollers, in the casinos right around Australia, and the machines are going in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will argue philosophically, `Leave it up to individual choice.' We do not do that with smoking; we have banned all ads on smoking. I think we should either introduce a very severe code of conduct on gambling ads or ban them outright. That is an authoritarian view and it is not necessarily shared around this chamber, but I certainly think that the ads currently appearing on television for gambling are outrageous and misleading and are doing great social damage. It is not a question of product differentiation here; it is encouraging gambling, and it is on the rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It used to be once that, if you introduced one more form of gambling, it redistributed the gambling dollar from, say, the racing industry to a lottery. There is increasing evidence now that the overall cake is rapidly expanding and mendicant states are using this as a way of financing public programs irrespective of the social damage that gambling is doing. So I do think the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) should not be quite as offhand as he was here in the chamber the other day and he should give some consideration, at the very minimum, to an enforceable code of conduct on gambling advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue to do with media I want to raise is the coverage of Super League by the Sydney broadcasting corporation of Australia. We know that the ABC is into networking. We know the economies of scale that networking provides. But, for heaven's sake, to block out the 5 to 7 p.m. slot in television in Victoria for Super League is an absolutely crass and stupid decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any parliamentarian becomes multifaceted in their sports tastes, because we all come to Canberra. I confess that I enjoy rugby league and I always have. And I have started to understand and really enjoy rugby union at an international level. Victorians do not mind rugby league being on their television sets&mdash;even on the national broadcaster&mdash;at 11 o'clock at night. But, if you cut out that prime time viewing to see a few people run around the park, firstly, the ratings will collapse and, secondly, quality programs&mdash;like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Barchester Chronicles</EMPHASIS> and all the Jane Austen stuff they run between five and six and the terrific wildlife stuff that we never see because we are on our way to Canberra between six and seven&mdash;will all go off the air. This is all because they want to do a network deal around Australia and that is driving the viewers away in the four Aussie rules states. This is because the ABC is totally Sydney centred&mdash;we all know that. All the arts programs are no longer being produced in Victoria and are centralised in Sydney. That is to the disadvantage of Australians and does not meet the ABC charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, last week what did we have at 9.30 on Saturday night? We had Super League. We had a referee shouting non&hyphen;stop into his personalised mike, so everyone turned off because they could not stand it anymore. Anyone who is home on a Saturday night would start with the great food program on SBS, switch across and watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Heartbeat</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bill</EMPHASIS>&mdash;as most people in this chamber would have done&mdash;and then settle in for a nice viewing evening, even though the cricket is not on on time. And we cop Super League! They should rethink this. By all means, cover the Super League. Put it on at 11 o'clock at night, when all the social isolates and recidivists&mdash;including me&mdash;can watch it, but do not put it on in prime time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move on to the third issue: the coverage of the cricket, which has had a bit of argy bargy around this chamber. Senator Alston came in and proudly announced that the final two sessions would be shown live. He gave the previous minister for communications a whack around the ears by referring to him as `a boy Bradman', which I found 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1289"> strange. I thought the previous minister would have enjoyed that appellation. But the fact is, when the acid was put on minister Lee in 1995, he got the full live coverage on free to air television in Australia. Senator Alston has not delivered the same product. However, he had one particular difficulty that minister Lee did not face. That is, networks, because of viewer loyalty, are reluctant to interrupt their normal ratings programs from 8.30 through to 10.30 by putting on a sporting event&mdash;we might actually get the televised rights to the one going on in the chamber in a minute&mdash;and that reluctance is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in getting the cricket from South Africa for the final four hours, Senator Alston would have met the requirements we put on him. We do not hold it against Senator Alston that it is live only on Foxtel. We understand that, even though Foxtel is wired up in the street where he lives, he has not tapped into it and has made the sacrifice the rest of us have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not getting it live for those two hours. When I saw the first test on Friday night last week, it came on at five past 11. It was 55 minutes late that night. Lo and behold, on Saturday night we were lucky: we got it live to air at 10 past 10 for the only time. What happened? Bad light stopped play at 10 past 12, and we missed out. But when I was here in Canberra on Sunday night, it did not come on at 10 past 10. They ran their movie through, and another half hour was missed. The same thing happened on Monday night. Last night, just as we settled in to watch it&mdash;because it was almost going to start on time&mdash;what happened? The Australian spinners knocked six of them over in an hour and a quarter, and we never got to watch it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the final four full sessions are not being shown live to air in South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia because of the time difference. But we must give credit to Channel 7, because they are not doing delayed telecasts. They are picking it up live when it starts. I give them some credit for that. Still, something is better than nothing. I congratulate Senator Alston for getting some of the cricket on the air, but comparisons with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the great efforts of Minister Lee are invidious in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final part of my <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> section this afternoon deals with the Whitlam lecture. People have been critical of that lecture being put on at 11 o'clock on a Sunday night and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Embassy</EMPHASIS> program being cancelled. They have been rightly critical of some of the procedures&mdash;the lack of crediting and the deal between the ABC and the ACTU. That criticism is all valid criticism. But for heaven's sake, if the ABC is serious and suggests that this is a show or an event of national importance, why did they put it on at 11 o'clock at night and not advertise it? There is another group out there who would have wanted to watch this and were not given the opportunity because they were not given advance notice and they were not told about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the government is probably right to look at the methodology of it, they should go a step further and say, `If you are right, ABC, that this is an event of national importance then, for heaven's sake, advertise it so that everyone can watch it.' I do not know how many of the people around this chamber knew the program was on that night. I think it was on a Sunday night and followed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compass</EMPHASIS> program. Some colleagues here, who are a little more devoted to their religious duties than I, may have actually picked it up. I must say that I am not a regular watcher of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compass</EMPHASIS> program. Well, let's be honest&mdash;I have never watched it but I am glad it is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I hope that Senator Alston will read some of these comments and take them on board, when he gets a spare moment&mdash;especially my comments on gambling advertising. That is a serious issue. It is an issue that his own Prime Minister has taken seriously and I would hope that he would take a serious view of it, in order to rectify the problem that exists.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1289"><TITLE>National Health and Medical Research Council</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely incredible that someone purporting to represent the state of Tasmania

After all, only a certain class of person is acceptable.' They have got to have money, apparently. That is the criterion according to Mr Cheek. That is a matter over which I and many other Tasmanians will cringe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sooner Mr Cheek apologises to the people of Tasmania and the people of the rest of Australia, withdraws the comment and, frankly, gets out of the position of population task force chairman the better.

Not only will people not be attracted to a state whose population task force chairman is saying which class of people is unacceptable there but also people in Tasmania, despairing of the quality of their government&mdash;given the comments of this task force chairman&mdash;may well be enticed to leave.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond, so far as I am able, to the comments made by Senator Kernot. I point out to the Senate that Senator Kernot launched her attack on me without doing the courtesy, as is normally done, of advising me that was to take place. I happened to be at an Amnesty International parliamentary group meeting. I was phoned by my staff after Senator Kernot embarked on this underhand tactic. I then had to come out of what I believe to be a very important meeting to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the way that the Leader of the Australian Democrats is going to operate in the Senate, then I am most disappointed indeed. I defy Senator Kernot to point to anything I have said publicly in denigration of her office or, indeed, any colleagues here in a personal sense. I think it is very important 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1291"> for people in this chamber to respect their colleagues. If they are going to attack their colleagues in this chamber, then at least give them the courtesy of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Kernot has accused me of passing on a letter, written by a senior academic in the Australian National University, a senior scientist, Dr Hapel, head of the experimental haematology group at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). Why would one not pass to the minister any material that is appropriate when that minister is giving consideration to a matter of such significance as the chairmanship of the National Health and Medical Research Council? I do not need to relay to the Senate how important it is to have as head of that organisation a person not only who is a capable researcher but also who is able to discharge the office with fairness and who is capable of doing a good job in that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish congratulate Professor Larkin on his being appointed chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I do hope that his time in that office is one that is devoted&mdash;I am sure it will be&mdash;to the improvement of medical research in this country. I hope that not only will he be devoted to the improvement but that also he will be able to redress some of the problems that have emerged. For example, Professors Baume, Kuhse and Singer were given scarce medical research funds to do a survey on euthanasia. For goodness sake! Here is something that ought not to have occurred and would not have occurred had there been a rigorous investigation of the application. Should these scarce medical research funds have been provided to people who were very much pro&hyphen;euthanasia? So one does look for more rigour in the process, as I indicated previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting back to the issues that Senator Kernot raised, of course I provided this to the minister. It was not for me to make it public then. Is she suggesting that I should have made this letter public and thus put Professor Funder under the public spotlight? Surely when one has a letter such as this one sends it to the appropriate minister and it is up to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister to investigate whether or not that material should be taken into account in the exercise of the duty of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that, prima facie, the letter I received from Dr Hapel was one which raised a number of questions, not least the question of the rights of persons with disabilities. In this particular case, as I believe the document Senator Kernot tabled shows, Dr Hapel's eyesight was in fact adverted to by Professor Funder. He said that the offer was conditional upon his undergoing appropriate medical evaluation. He had done that without discussing the matter with Dr Hapel. Where he got private medical information from I don't know. As Dr Hapel says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an innovative scientist poor eyesight is only an intrusion when it comes to certain aspects of bench work and in reading fine print in manuscripts. Given adequate technical support, there was never any reason why my scientific output would be impaired by my vision defect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me say this: we are talking about a top scientist who is recognised internationally. For example, this top scientist won a fellowship from the international union against cancer, which enabled him to work at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York during recent years. He was awarded the Eleanor Roosevelt fellowship. To Australian scientists, that is a very rare event indeed. Dr Hapel is one of 21 recipients of such an award since the Union International Contre Le Cancer began its operation in 1961 and one of only five who are current members of the UACC Society of Fellows. The sort of derogatory comment made by Senator Kernot of Dr Hapel is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his sabbatical as a visiting professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dr Hapel made a construct to knock out the gene encoding the receptor for an important haemopoietic regulator, CSF&hyphen;1 (M&hyphen;CFS). Previous highlights of his career include the molecular cloning of the gene encoding interleukin&hyphen;3, the first demonstration of the role for T cells in recovery from togavirus infections, and the first demonstration that enveloped forms of poxvirus were responsible for transmission of disease following immunisation with killed vaccines. Dr Hapel has had 86 publications of his work, covering a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1292"> variety of fields in biomedical research, of which three have been published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> and one in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cell</EMPHASIS>, the two most prestigious scientific journals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a letter from that particular scientist and about the adequacy and the capability of Professor Funder to be chairman of the NHMRC. I passed that letter on to the minister. I think I did what I should have done in the circumstances. It was for the minister and the department to consider the relevance or otherwise of that letter and if they wanted to raise it with the professor. It was not for me to publicise the letter. That would have been unfair to Professor Funder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it perfectly clear: there has been a beat&hyphen;up about this matter and some sections of the media have been involved in that beat&hyphen;up. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and Geoff Kitney's analysis of the reasons for the non&hyphen;appointment of Professor Funder. His comment noted that Professor Funder's `1990'&mdash;actually it was 1991&mdash;criticism of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the ANU `went down very badly in some quarters'. Perhaps there should have been an extra sentence to indicate that one of those quarters was an Australian Senate committee which, after three days of hearings, crossed party lines in finding major shortcomings of process in the review conducted by Dr John Funder of the school. Surely it would not have been unreasonable to add that. We should expect some accuracy and fullness in reporting by the media about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> also had an article by Dr Paul Komesaroff which indicated that the author was `Executive Director of the Eleanor Shaw Centre for the Study of Medicine, Society and Law in Melbourne'. What it did not say was that Dr Komesaroff is an employee of the Baker Institute and, as such, is presumably responsible to its director. And do you know who the director is? Dr John Funder. Wasn't that pertinent? Wouldn't it have been reasonable to expect that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> might have made that comment? Yet it did not, and there is a number of other examples.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Senate in pretty direct terms that the Senate committee was not convinced that the John Curtin School of Medical Research attached to the Australian National University should become part and parcel of a National Health and Medical Research Council group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diversity of scientific research in this country is very important. There are great issues at stake here and those issues should, of course, be considered very thoroughly by the research community as a whole. I believe that the research community as a whole will congratulate Professor Larkin on his appointment as Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council and will wish Professor Larkin the best in that very important and responsible position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I express disappointment that Senator Kernot has stooped to the level of the surprise tactic, attacking a member of the parliament, a colleague, without having the decency to notify that member. If that is the way she wants to play it, that is her decision. I do not intend to play it that way, and I do hope that her colleagues might have a word or two with her about that.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1294"> particular, create jobs and raise standards of living. These are the important issues facing modern Australia. That is what this Howard government is all about, in contrast to your dismal efforts of concentration on and total preoccupation with the internal affairs of the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not surprising that people like George Campbell are saying, `I don't know what the ALP stands for any more.' I am not surprised that we hearing that. I am not surprised that we are hearing such confusing statements from the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, as `We are going to have to start thinking of some policy soon&mdash;float one or two, to see how they run,' because that is the best that the ALP of today can offer. And it is not surprising in those circumstances that the people of Australia are still sending the ALP a clear message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is amazing that, after 12 months of hard decisions&mdash;albeit fair decisions&mdash;the Howard government is held in higher esteem than at the time of the election and Labor in lower esteem. Why in lower esteem? Because they have shown no signs that they have learnt any lesson at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP gave Australians a million unemployed, business interest rates of about 20 per cent, bankcard interest rates of about 26 per cent, foreign debt of $150 million and a current account deficit of $180 billion. One would have thought that the first thing a party in that situation, unceremoniously thrown out of government, would say was, `We recognise that we let the Australian people down. We recognise that we made mistakes, and we are going to try to constructively work our way back.' Have we seen any sign of that? We have not seen one sign. All we have seen is a preoccupation with the internal affairs of the Labor Party and an attempt to seek retribution against one who left their midst. That is all we see from the ALP of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are pleased&mdash;we don't dwell on it&mdash;that the Australian people are now endorsing us even more strongly than 12 months ago at the last election. We are pleased about it because we believe that it is a recognition that we did make the hard decisions in the first year. We tackled that deficit that we inherited, the one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Senator Cook told us did not exist: $8,000 million of deficit that actually in the end turned out to be nearer $10,000 million. We tackled it. We took the hard decisions to cut expenditure, but we did it fairly. We gave money back to families, who did it so badly under Labor's recession&mdash;the worst recession since the 1930s. We gave it back in the first year of government. We have put policies in place to stimulate and support small business&mdash;the provisional tax uplift factor. Labor put it up; we brought it down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tried to share the cuts in expenditure fairly across a range of portfolio areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the article that you are referring to, Senator Eggleston. It is full of blatant untruths and misrepresentations.

For example, the article suggests that two months after the government knew about Ms Townsend's departure from the Office of the Status of Women, there has still been no appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the facts? The facts are that there is a normal time frame when somebody is being appointed to the Public Service. We have not changed that. The process of finding a replacement for the head of the Office of the Status of Women commenced as soon as Ms Townsend announced her resignation on 17 December. A headhunting firm was chosen and contacted on 24 December, just one week later.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of these furphies was that the Affirmative Action Agency has been effectively dismantled. That, again, is totally incorrect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Synroc technology has the added benefit that it dramatically reduces the amount of waste produced compared with other methods currently used. For example, to process ANSTO's current stockpile using synroc would produce only two cubic metres of intermediate level waste compared with around 250 cubic metres of concreted intermediate level waste if it was reprocessed at Dounreay. Consequently, the total amount of waste material generated from processing our own spent fuel would be minimal. It would be classified as long-lived intermediate level waste and would be suitable to be stored in an aboveground storage facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth and state consultative committee on radioactive waste management will be considering a proposal for a national intermediate level waste storage facility. The government is considering&mdash;I think this answers another of the senator's questions&mdash;processing only our own stockpile of spent fuel. Consequently, the size and cost of such a synroc facility would be much smaller than the commercial reprocessing facilities run overseas to cater for the nuclear power industry. Any processing would involve significantly lower levels of radioactivity than those already associated with ANSTO's current radiopharmaceutical production. Radioactive releases to the environment continue to be well within ANSTO's existing authorised public dose levels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister. It refers to the so&hyphen;called throwaway Chinese children, the hundreds of thousands of them in orphanages&mdash;mostly baby girls&mdash;who human rights groups consider have less than a 50 per cent survival rate. Is it a fact that Australia and the PRC have been engaged in discussions leading, hopefully, towards an inter&hyphen;country adoption agreement? Why is this agreement taking so long? Is it a fact that the fault is not really on the side of the PRC? Will the Prime Minister, during his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> visit to China, raise the matter with the Chinese government, after he has sorted the situation out here, and sign or make sure that there is an inter&hyphen;country adoption agreement between China and Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1304" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am familiar with Senator Harradine's interest in this matter because he asked me a question late last year concerning the failure to negotiate a bilateral agreement on adoptions with the PRC. He asked basically, as I recall, what action the government would take. This question is asked again in the same vein. I have to say, Senator Harradine, that it seems from the notes that I have been given that, regrettably, notwithstanding efforts that have been made in the meantime, there still does not appear to be a negotiated bilateral agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, a bilateral agreement is essential under Australian state law before an overseas adoption can take place. Interestingly, it is claimed that China has no bilateral agreements with other countries in relation to inter&hyphen;country adoptions, although that is disputed by at least one of the non&hyphen;government adoption agencies, which claims that it has an agreement with the United Kingdom, though we have not been able to substantiate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said on the last occasion that a meeting was going to be held in Victoria. The Victorian government department seems to be taking the lead on the Australian side in this negotiation. There was to be a meeting in December to further coordinate Australia's efforts. I understand that took place and that our department of foreign affairs gave assistance in identifying the relevant Chinese agency with which to negotiate. Up until that time, it had been believed that there were at least two Chinese agencies and there had been problems as to which was the appropriate one to deal with. I understand that subsequent to that the Victorian Department of Human Services wrote on 14 January this year to the China centre for adoption asking that they might recommence negotiations. That letter was duly delivered with department of foreign affairs assistance. But, to date, there has been no response. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1305">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask about outstanding issues. Two outstanding issues of which I am aware are, first, the requirement of the Chinese for payment of a $US5,000 bond and, secondly, a difference arising over permanent residence status that would be held by the adoptive children upon arrival in Australia and their loss of Chinese citizenship. There was a concern that, if the intended adoption broke down, the child could be left without citizenship. I understand that there is no reason why these two obstacles cannot be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a strong supporter of inter&hyphen;country adoption, I would wish to see those issues resolved and Australia enter as soon as possible into a bilateral agreement with China that might facilitate adoption of these children. I will pass to the Prime Minister your request, Senator, that he intervene and take this matter up further with his Chinese interlocutors. I will ensure that he is provided with the base information that I have given to you today.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This government is in self&hyphen;denial mode on the issue of legal aid, as with so many other issues. But they are on their own. They are in denial of the fact that this system is falling apart. They got it into this mess and they are taking no responsibility for it. They are not my words that the system is in crisis; they are the words of the Chief Justice of Australia who asserted towards the end of last year that our justice system is in crisis. That crisis has been occasioned by this government's inactivity and slashing of funding in the legal aid area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National legal aid, the system we have in Australia, is one that is recognised internationally as being impressive. It is a system that is currently being destroyed by this government and this Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and, by his inaction, this Prime Minister (Mr Howard). You could argue, in his defence, that the Attorney-General, at best, just does not know what is going on. In respect of the Prime Minister, he should know better and he should take an interest. So long as this issue continues&mdash;and it will continue&mdash;it will bleed on the government. At best, you could say that the current situation with the national legal aid system is fluid&mdash;at best, that is, if you were the government. But most objective commentators call it a crisis. You have to acknowledge, Senator Hill, that it is a pretty ordinary mess that you have got us into on this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When what is needed is reform, what we are getting is destruction&mdash;destruction of a system which is internationally recognised. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What does the Attorney&hyphen;General do? He roams around in blissful ignorance of the fact that states are getting agitated, states are concerned that they have been ignored and states are monumentally upset that they have not been involved in the planning process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way the Attorney&hyphen;General is handling this issue, you can liken him very much to Chauncey Gardener in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Being There</EMPHASIS>. It is all happening around him; it is all falling apart around him. But this Attorney-General does not care, he does not want to care. As far as he is concerned, he has no time for it. You just have to look at the litany of stuff-ups in this area. You look at the figures they have been using&mdash;the figures used by the Attorney-General were incorrect. Even if you accept the formula that they are applying for the basis of allocation of funds, he asserted that he used the latest available figures. Evidence upon evidence, from commission after commission, to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry on legal aid has contradicted the Attorney. He has misled the parliament, but he has misled it in a way that he does not want to acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures that were available to the government to base their formula on were the 1995-96 figures. As I said, legal aid commission after commission can show that. Figures are available monthly to the Commonwealth government as to how legal aid money is spent. The Commonwealth government has, until recently, had a person from the Attorney-General's department representing it on every state legal aid body. They knew what the latest figures were. In fact, they published the 1995-96 figures before they notified the states of their allocations under the new arrangement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stated by the Attorney-General that he has been keen to conduct negotiations with the various states in a bilateral fashion and that it has been difficult to negotiate with the states and territories as a whole. That is quite reasonable. So for Senator Bolkus to say that there is anything unusual in this approach is quite absurd. What the Attorney-General is doing is negotiating with each state and territory on a discrete basis. The agreement with the ACT is heartening and, with these two developments in legal aid, it would appear that the Attorney-General is well on his way to solving the legal aid problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to hark bark to the question of these figures. The Attorney-General stated that the initial cuts were based on figures which were only available from the states themselves. These figures were for 1994-95, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee received evidence that the Commonwealth could only rely on those figures provided by the states themselves. So what the Commonwealth has to do is to get those figures from the states in the first place. How else can the Commonwealth negotiate any deal or any resolution to this problem if it is not getting the up-to-date figures from the states?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the fact that Senator Bolkus has said that it has been stated by the judiciary that legal aid is in crisis, I believe the comments that are alluded to refer in a wider sense to the judicial system. Part of this whole situation regarding legal aid requires scrutiny of the courts themselves to ensure that the courts themselves are running as efficiently as they could be. That is part of the Attorney-General's scope. The Attorney-General has stated time and time again that he wants to ensure the efficiency of delivery of service; that is, that the legal aid dollar goes as far as it possibly can. I believe that the states, in their own way, would want to see that as well. So we have here a situation where the Commonwealth and state governments really have a similar goal, and they can achieve it by negotiation.</PARA>

I think Mr Foss on this issue had the interests of the constituency of Western Australia in mind when he wrote his letter to Mr Williams. I certainly hope so. I look forward, as a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, to meeting with Mr Foss at some time in the future and to hearing at first-hand his evidence as to what is happening with the Australian legal aid system, as the committee has heard from two other attorneys from the states and two further attorneys from the two territories.</PARA></TALK.START>

Western Australia can always demonstrate level of need due to the size of our State and the extra costs in trying to service it. However, I have a feeling that by "need" you are referring to the incidence of Commonwealth matters, and to call that "need" is an excellent example of what George Orwell would call "double speak".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not having a go at Mr Williams at all. That is his colleague Mr Peter Foss, a colleague of Senator Ellison, who has taken the fight right up to the Attorney to try to avert the crisis that Mr Williams and the cabinet has caused in Australia by virtue of their decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Foss's letter has been leaked to the media and it is out there for people to see. I just want to address the matter that I raised again in my question to Senator Vanstone, the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I asked about the collection of statistics and I alleged in my question that in the answer she gave to me on 6 February she had misled the Senate. The statistics were available to the Attorney-General when the calculations were done and the states were given wrong figures on wrong statistics. That is clearly on the public record. Yet we have not have had a retraction of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has been given a further chance today and indeed the Attorney-General has been given a further opportunity today to correct the record. I wished Senator Ellison had been

Perhaps we might have got the record straight. Unfortunately, even after the hours of questioning, it appears there is a great deal of confusion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One important point that needs to be made in all of this argument, not necessarily a political argument, is the cost of collecting these statistics. It has been argued to the committee that one particular Legal Aid Commission spends some 12 to 15 per cent of its budget collecting the statistics and providing them to the Commonwealth, yet the Commonwealth&mdash;when push comes to shove and it is really needed&mdash;gets the figures wrong. But like so many other matters&mdash;this happened with the Attorney-General's Department since this administration took over&mdash;whenever an error is exposed in the calculations it is always somebody else's fault.

There is no doubt that legal aid is an important institution in this country and has served Australia well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite would be aware from their time in government that whenever the Commonwealth and states start renegotiating deals there will be all the necessary posturing and muscle flexing by both sides before commonsense prevails and an agreement is reached. As the honourable Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) has pointed out to the Senate, an agreement has already been reached with the ACT. Queensland does not seem to be far off and we still have another three months to go before 30 June 1997, which will be the day when the agreements expire.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1311">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that in the contributions of honourable senators opposite none of them referred to the fact that the previous Labor government complained that state and territory legal aid commissions were diverting Commonwealth funds away from issues of Commonwealth interest, particularly family law, but they never sought to correct this anomaly. So when the Labor Party was thrown out of office they were already in the throes of looking into this situation. They themselves had come to that point of view either rightly or wrongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that I am astounded honourable senators opposite are not prepared to recognise or indeed detail in any way the question of why this government has had to consider making any expenditure cuts whatsoever. The reason is clear and is very simple. You people went to the last election promising that the budget was in surplus. We got in and found that you were out only by a factor of $10 billion! If ever Senator McKiernan wants to come into this chamber and complain about somebody getting figures wrong, rather than talking about a few million dollars in legal aid, he might like to talk about $10 billion of the whole federal budget which his party, through the then Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition, misled the Australian people about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party can sit there and throw all the stones they like but the people of Australia know that the real justice issue is: do we as an Australian parliament corporately give to the next generation of Australians a huge debt because we want to live beyond our means? Or are we as a parliament going to be saying to them, `We are not going to leave you with an outrageous legacy of debt. We are in fact going to give you a country with a balanced budget that is not outrageously in debt.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a real justice issue which affects each and every Australian and that is what we have been charged to do, to provide justice to the Australian people by providing them with a balanced budget. Ten billion dollars worth had to be made up as a result of the former government's negligence. Unfortunately, part of the cuts that we have had to implement&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">and it gives us no joy in doing so&mdash;is to clean up Labor's mess.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is very disingenuous of those opposite to beat their breasts and say that this is something that is really bad. Why do we have to consider these cuts? Because of your profligacy, because of your over&hyphen;expenditure, your view that there was no tomorrow and damn the next generation. You had no interest in their future. You said, `We will just spend and try to keep in government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue of justice in all this discussion is the kind of legacy we leave to the next generation. There is a lot of good happening in Attorney-General's, not the least of which is the appointment of the honourable parliamentary secretary. I am sure he will play a very important role in that position. The Attorney-General is on the way, the ACT has been bolted down and Queensland is just about there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Heffernan today, relating to potential health effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation associated with telecommunications equipment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I need to say at the outset that I was appalled and ashamed to hear the remarks made by Senator Alston. I have become used to a level of personal attack from the minister. Not only has he directed remarks to somebody outside this chamber, but he has directed them to somebody in the gallery who was listening to those remarks, and I thought that was indeed shameful. I say again that I am appalled and ashamed and apologise to Dr Cherry for those remarks directed towards him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, this is an unprecedented attack on a citizen who has no right of immediate reply. Not only that, but it is of course most untrue. Most of the remarks made by Senator Alston were highly defamatory and Senator Alston would realise that it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1312"> would both be stupid and require more courage than he has to repeat those words outside this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was immediately reminded of that phrase that is so often used, `Methinks he protesteth too much.' The measure of this attack indicated to me that what is being said by the Democrats, by me and by eminent scientists such as Dr Cherry is hitting home. Perhaps this is striking a chord which the minister is not prepared to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all else this issue is about public health. That is another reason why we in this chamber should be so worried, that a minister who is responsible for telecommunications has so readily dismissed the work of scientists, and I am not just speaking of Dr Cherry, but also of the other scientists whom he represents. He came along to the Senate today and spoke in the committee room at lunchtime. He talked about the work of those other scientists right around the world. His message to us was that as parliamentarians we have an obligation to have an open mind, to take on board all manner of views, research and work that is being done in this field and to simply hear and listen to that work in order to make sensible judgments about what we do as people who write the laws of this land and who have the responsibility to protect the health of Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an indication that our minister does not take this role seriously and that he has chosen to make these immoderate and outrageous remarks in this place today. It is trivial by comparison, but I want to refer to some remarks made by Senator Alston just a couple of days ago. He was referring to a remark made about Senator Newman. I gather that Senator Newman was called a `dope'. The response Senator Alston gave was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you ought to make it clear that this sort of sledging should not be allowed to continue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly what we have seen here today is not an ill-considered, off&hyphen;the&hyphen;cuff remark about somebody being a dope.

Then in his supplementary he called for there to be a rational debate about the issue of electromagnetic radiation emissions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have before us in the Senate a massive number of telecommunications bills. One of them deals with the future infrastructure of telecommunications in this country, including the placing and siting of mobile telephone towers. All around Australia, local communities, who are not shameless charlatans by any means, are asking relevant questions about the siting of those towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has said to the minister on a number of occasions, through the Senate committee looking at this legislation, that we want to get a rational outcome, a proper process of management of these towers where the community has an effective say. That has not been helped by the minister going bananas in here today in his description of a member of the public who has a concern about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met Dr Neil Cherry today at a private meeting with Senator Allison and Senator Crowley. He did not strike me as a lunatic, an idiot or a charlatan. I may disagree with some of his views. I would also point out to Senator Alston that Dr Cherry admitted to me that, in 1987, he stood as a Labor candidate in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1313"> New Zealand. I am surprised that we did not get him bagged for that as well. He also pointed out that he was subsequently elected to a regional local government body with a substantial majority by the votes of local people. So this is a person who has put his credibility on the line and has been supported by the public in his own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, when I saw on Channel 2 news a segment of Dr Cherry speaking at a function in Sydney, I actually rang the minister's office to say that this was an example of why this issue should be treated very cautiously and sensibly, not expecting the minister to come in here like a ranting, raving maniac to bag an individual whom he has yet to meet and whose arguments he is yet to hear. The minister has put this debate backwards by a large degree by attacking an individual rather than arguing on the merits of the argument. And that is not unusual for Senator Alston, unfortunately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is going to be an ongoing debate in this community and, unless it is handled rationally and sanely, we will go nowhere with it. Unfortunately, Senator Alston is going to encourage those people with fears about it to think there is a conspiracy by the government, because the minister is attacking an individual and not arguing on the merits of the issue. They will take this as evidence that there is something being hidden, because Senator Alston is not arguing the merits of the argument; he is attacking this individual. I believe that, when this is debated in the Senate in a couple of weeks, this issue will get a proper airing. I only hope Minister Alston participates in the debate sensibly and rationally and takes account of very moderate views across a broad range of this community concerned about electromagnetic radiation emissions and does not bag anybody who disagrees with him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 473.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an urgent matter. It is vitally important that the Senate estimates committee has an opportunity to fully investigate a range of allegations that have been made against Senator Colston. There are quite a number of issues that need to be clarified as soon as possible. I think it is important to put this particular motion in context. The Senate estimates committee is our pre&hyphen;eminent mechanism in terms of accountability&mdash;parliamentary accountability and government administration accountability&mdash;and the administration of the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that a number of allegations were canvassed at estimates committees last week. But of course there also are a range of new matters that have arisen out of those issues that were canvassed at the estimates committee. No doubt they have arisen as a result of the estimates committee hearings. I think in particular there were some matters referred to by the Usher of the Black Rod, Mr Rob Allison, on the Channel 10 news on Sunday, 2 March. Mr Allison is quoted as saying on camera:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear, from the airline schedules, that Senator Colston was in one place when his travel allowance claim suggested he was in another. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1320">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interviewer asked a question. Mr Allison said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, it appears that the allegations can be proven on the documentation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are eight suspicious dates where $140 a night travel allowance was claimed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Allison said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I would imagine that Senator Colston has a case to answer.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think senators would also recall that these issues were raised in Melbourne's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  on 2 March. Paul Daley, their national affairs correspondent, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The embattled independent Senator Mal Colston was paid up to $140 a night in allowances for staying in Canberra at least eight times while airline records indicate he was elsewhere, Senate officials have discovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the Senate's chief administrators, the Usher of the Black Rod, Mr Robert Allison, said random checks with airlines by his department had uncovered flight information that contradicted the senator's travel allowance claims in 1994 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Usher of the Black Rod was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  and direct to camera on Channel 10 news, and then on 3 March Mr Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, circulated a disclaimer in relation to Senator Colston's travel. On this occasion Mr Evans said that press reports have cited an officer of the Department of the Senate as a source of a suggestion that there are discrepancies in Senator Colston's travel and travel allowance payments, and these reports are not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters have arisen from the estimates committee. It is appropriate that the estimates committee be reconvened to deal with them. It is not unusual for Senate estimates committees to be reconvened in this way. There are many precedents. The most recent ones I can recall related to the Wright family affair and further investigations into the DDB Needham gun buyback rort. That happened just last year. On 7 February 1995 Senator Kemp successfully moved a motion to reconvene the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to deal with the National Media Liaison Service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the difference between Senator Alston and me is that I have attacked an individual who has the capacity under privilege to respond to a whole range of allegations but Senator Alston has come into the chamber today and attacked an individual 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1322"> who has no such right. No doubt that person can go to the Privileges Committee and have a statement of response put down on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) indicated, ample precedent for reconvening estimates committees. We have done so several times by our motion and by motion of the other side since the coalition won the government last March. What we want to explore is the fact that an issue was raised at an estimates committee and an investigation from that particular question was not asked for. The question was asked about the possibility of a senator claiming travel allowance when that senator was not present in the location claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, you will see that at that stage I did not ask for an investigation. What then happened was that a story was put about that Senator Colston had initiated this investigation. I find that curious because officials from the Department of the Senate had rung me earlier for more information on this particular subject long before Senator Colston initiated an investigation. What we then hear is that there has been an investigation into travel allowance claims, cross&hyphen;correlation with transport and Commonwealth car records and some doubt thrown on the validity of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Department of the Senate, coming out of the previous estimates committee, has taken this initiative, we seek to reconvene the committee to ask certain questions. But I should qualify that right away. We may be very circumscribed in the types of questions we can ask. If, indeed, the report has not been sent to the President and acted upon, we would be loath on this side to ask questions directly concerning a particular senator or a particular issue even if we reconvened the estimates committee on Friday. We have a long history of not interfering in operational matters&mdash;be they matters by way of inquiry, or the Federal Police or anything else. So I make that clear to everyone before they vote on this motion and maybe a subsequent one that that is our attitude.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, in the circumstances, we found that inquiries were still under way and no report had been sent to the President, or if we found that there was a reference to the Australian Federal Police, we would not be asking specific questions on this particular matter. We would then go to the methodology of the investigation which is, I think, fairly before us. As Senator Faulkner indicated, we have conflicting evidence&mdash;maybe not conflicting evidence, but we would like it resolved&mdash;between various officers who work for the Department of the Senate. This is not in any way intended as a witch-hunt against any of the officers of the Senate but is just to clarify what those issues are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if indeed we are not able to pursue our specific questions which might be regarded as new questions as to allegations, what we would be seeking to thoroughly check would be that the methods of analysis and investigation were appropriate to what the investigation was about. As I say, there is ample precedent for reopening the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move to the issue of 7 May. We have arranged the estimates committee program basically to suit the convenience of the government, but taking our own self&hyphen;interest into account at the same time. One of the great concessions to this government was not to have to have or force supplementary hearings during this sitting period. We moved it to the non-sitting period and we gave departments weeks and weeks to get their answers back in, all designed for a fairer and more balanced program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we find that that is going to be used against us, to inhibit us in our questioning at estimates committees, then I guess we are going to have to reconsider that and have supplementary hearings to additional estimates and to estimates just a couple of weeks after the initial hearings. Those on the other side should think about that. That is not desirable. We are not seeking to reopen dozens of estimates or committee hearings. We are seeking to open one with a very limited brief of inquiry. We will keep to our word that, if in fact there are operational matters or inquiries still under way, our questions will go to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1323"> the methodology and not to the actual substance of the inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motives of the Labor Party are quite frankly irrelevant in this particular matter. What we have is a situation where both natural justice and the needs of the moment require that this process be hastened. We have in the Senate two senators at least and in the House of Representatives one member at least who are subject to allegations of having rorted, to use the colloquial phrase, the allowances and entitlement system. It is natural justice that those allegations, whether they are true or not, are put to bed as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent to me, having sat through the estimates committee, and it is apparent to us as Australian Democrats, having observed the allegations subsequent to those estimates committees, that further information and further allegations have emerged since then which deserve the proper exploration of the issue. The Australian Democrats made a request of Labor to amend their motion, because our concern is the much broader issue&mdash;that is, the fact and the reality of how these allowances and entitlements are dealt with at present and how we can communicate the way in which they are to be dealt with in future to lay to rest some of the damage done to our reputation as an institution and to our reputation as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not seek to put into words the amendment we requested of Labor because we will support their motion and then use that process of estimates, if it is agreed to by the Senate, to pursue the issues that matter to us. I will spell out those issues. Firstly, we will look at whether the Department of Administrative Services is resourced with people and money in a manner which enables it to do its job in such a way as to prevent massive loopholes occurring&mdash;in other words, that the internal management and audit and administration systems all work correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we will look at whether they have the means to audit or to compare such things as travel allowance claims, Senate sitting days, committee sitting days, airfares and car usage to make sure that there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism whereby a senator can lay off one against the other and get away with moneys or entitlements that otherwise they would not be able to enjoy. Thirdly, we will be seeking to see if there are some means by which the department can report to the minister or the Senate on a regular basis to ensure that a regular audit not only goes on but is known to go on and is reported as having gone on, and that the normal functions which go on in the better institutions and organisations in Australia in terms of corporate governance occur in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, we will be seeking advice from the officials as to where the problems are so that in future Australians, the Senate and we can be satisfied that the opportunity for misconduct, impropriety, corruption or fraud are absolutely limited because, in the pursuit of this issue, we are all splattered with the blood when an individual or individuals are shot. It is for those reasons that we want this process sorted out as soon as possible. We see the extra estimates sitting as one more piece in the jigsaw of accountability and urgent review.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate as the chairman of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to which the motion refers. I have to say, particularly having sat through the estimates hearings dealing with many of these matters last week, that I see this motion as nothing other than the next chapter in Labor's continuing campaign, driven by sheer naked hatred, against Senator Colston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you wanted any evidence of this, you would simply have to have witnessed Senator Ray's extraordinary attack on Senator Colston yesterday in this place. I cannot recall a more vicious, premeditated, impassioned speech of vitriol in my time in this parliament. I am pleased to see that the debate today is on a more responsible and rational level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is another sleazy, grubby exercise by Labor to judge and convict a member of this place before even any charge has been laid. That is really what it is about. It is a basic tenet of our civilised society and of the rules of law that there is a presumption 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1324"> of innocence until guilt is proved. If the Labor Party ever believed in that rule of law, it completely threw it out the window in respect of its approach to Senator Colston and the allegations. In doing so, I must say that Labor has brought disrepute to the parliament and charted us into very dangerous waters indeed. What we have witnessed in recent days is political thuggery at its worst and I think that is very dangerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion in my view is redundant and unnecessary. There are already more than one official investigation into the matters that are essentially the subject of this motion. One is by the Department of Administrative Services, another I understand is within the confines of the Senate, and I think there may be others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee formally concluded its examination of departments and agencies within its charter last week, with the exception of ATSIC, which we are dealing with tonight. It did so, as Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner well know because they were there, particularly Senator Ray, after spending hours and hours on questions relating to possible misuse of travel allowances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to express some concern and real doubt as to whether, in any event, the estimates committee is the appropriate forum in which to pursue this particular matter and the allegations made. Serious allegations have been made and they must be examined. The government is fully supportive and encouraging of those being fully examined, but it has to be done in a way that is fair to all concerned, in particular to the person against whom the allegations are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to my starting point. I think this is all about the next instalment in Labor's

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is one of urgency. It goes to the very basic questions of accountability within this Senate. There has been new evidence put before this Senate in the form of various media reports and officers of this parliament suggesting that there have been irregularities in the claims made by a senator in this place. These are matters of fundamental importance&mdash;fundamental in terms of accountability and the integrity of this place&mdash;that ultimately go to the issue of the integrity of the government's legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be no more serious an issue, given the composition of the Senate, than allegations that a senator is rorting his allowances. None of us of here have any time for rorters. I am surprised that, over on that side of the chamber, we have people who are prepared to defend this sort of behaviour. We have people in this chamber who are obviously prepared to defend the actions of a senator in this matter. That is a matter that you ought to take up amongst yourselves. I wonder how many of you could expect the same level of support if these were the sorts of allegations made against you from within the leadership of your party? What would happen is that you would be out the door so fast it would not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter and they would have a replacement in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here are very special circumstances that go to the fundamental way in which votes are counted in this chamber. They go to the issues of this government's legislative program and the manner in which votes are bought in this place. So it comes back to this very basic issue: what is the level of accountability in this parliament? What is the basis on which there can be a proper examination of the claims made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand there are issues that go to whether or not appropriate claims were made in February 1994. Of course, it has been alleged that on a number of occasions in February 1994 there were claims made when actual travel does not indicate that those claims were justified. There were similar matters in May 1994, February 1995, March 1995 and May 1995. These are the issues that I would like to consider at the estimates committee. I would like to be able to consider what action has been taken within this parliament to make sure that appropriate measures have been taken to actually defend the integrity of this parliament. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of 4 March, Senator Colston himself is quoted as saying that he has found irregularities in his own claims. I look forward to a further investigation of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short raises the issue about the rule of law. We state it quite clearly. I understand the report is going to the President of the Senate concerning affairs relating back to 1992. We are not pursuing irregularities referred to the Federal Police by the rule of law and properly investigated. We are pursuing the process by which claims and payments are made in terms of the way in which this parliament actually functions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abandonment of Australian farmers by the Federal Government as demonstrated by the refusal of the Queensland Government to sign the new National Drought Policy which slashes tens of millions of dollars from future drought funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Last week federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson, used the last meeting of the Agricultural and Resource Management Committee of Australia and New Zealand to announce that the meeting endorsed a new drought policy which basically cuts drought relief by tens of millions of dollars and heralds a shift towards so-called self-reliance for farmers suffering from drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's media release announces that the federal and state agricultural ministers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1330"> endorse the plan but fails to mention that his National Party counterpart in Queensland, state primary industries minister Trevor Perrett, refused to sign the endorsement. What an omission! Minister Anderson also omitted to mention that the New South Wales agriculture minister also objected to the new policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new policy to be ratified in June would end the drought exceptional circumstances system which automatically triggered assistance for farmers suffering severe drought. It is so ironic that the drought package introduced by Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating&mdash;and I say that because Labor can stand on its record here&mdash;has been abolished by a National Party primary industries minister. I am sure honourable senators will remember National Party members and senators stomping up and down the country screaming blue murder at inaction by the Labor Party over drought funding two years ago. Now their own National Party minister is going to abolish the whole program. They should hang their heads in shame. On this occasion, the National Party primary industries minister in Queensland is quite right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for primary industries wants to terminate drought exceptional circumstances and force farmers and state governments to go through the whole process of jumping up and down and lobbying and getting federal politicians out of Canberra to drought affected areas before farmers can get any special drought funding. This is bad policy, cynical in the extreme and it will go down like a lead balloon in the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am making a fuss about the Howard government's massive cuts to drought relief because my own home state of Queensland, despite the recent rain which is very welcome, has suffered drought for most of this decade and is still around 20 per cent drought declared. It will be hardest hit once this policy is introduced. Rich farmers in New South Wales of course will not have to worry very much. In Queensland, farmers are just beginning to recover and the government plans to show them a clean set of heels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Anderson says, `I don't walk away from drought relief provisions currently applying in Queensland and New South 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wales.' But what about when they run out? Is this government God? Can this government say, `There will not be any more droughts because we have declared that there should not be, so we do not need any contingency plans'? These cuts are mean in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's new drought policy eliminates subsidies for fodder&mdash;you know, the fodder drives that have gone out to drought affected families. It is a wonderful initiative which has enabled all Australians to understand better the problems of the bush, but this government cannot even support community initiatives like that. You really cannot understand where they are coming from. The new drought policy also removes exceptional circumstance interest rate subsidies, which have been so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new drought policy refers to a social security task force on farm welfare. Let me say that it is repeating work already done in the Senate; repeating exactly the inquiries which we have conducted which were, for the most part, chaired by National Party senators. They are doing the work all over again so they can avoid taking any action. Have an inquiry and then they will not have to do anything. Right now farm families are suffering terribly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about Senator Vanstone's shocking Austudy means test? The evidence coming in today is that, despite the fact that she says it has been fixed up, farm families are still unable to access Austudy. This government, like the government before it, has failed completely to address the problems of the Austudy assets test, which discriminates against farmers. So farm welfare goes into the too&hyphen;hard basket and drought relief is cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it great having a National Party in government so farmers have a voice in Canberra! Only the farmers do not think so. Instead of using the ARMCANZ conference to help farmers come up with ways to help them deal with drought, outbreaks of disease like anthrax, ovine johns and anthracnose affecting lupins, the federal minister for primary industries used one of the most significant agricultural conferences of the year to fulfil his cabinet's budget agenda to cut, cut and cut.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1331">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote from an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> yesterday. It is very interesting to see what ministers from the National Party in Queensland think of the federal government. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland farm leaders welcomed the tough stand taken by Primary Industries Minister Trevor Perrett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Perrett said the State Government would not walk away from producers suffering from severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Federal Minister, John Anderson, has been given the message that we are just not prepared to roll over," Mr Perrett said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The proposed new policy would virtually cut off the support lifeline after six months, pushing producers over the brink through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The message finally seems to be sinking in that the north is more prone to severe drought than the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We endorse the broad direction of farmers being more self&hyphen;reliant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But this policy cannot work until there are real incentives for producers to put money aside."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same article, the President of the Queensland Grain Growers Association said that the new policy was `a bureaucratic whitewash to save money'. If you want anyone to really put it on the line, you should always listen to Ian MacFarlane. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">United Graziers Association chief executive Michael Prendergast said the Federal Government did not recognise the recovery period needed after severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The policy under consideration is just not acceptable to Queensland," he said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have is a government with National Party members in it that is unable to deliver anything to farmers in this country. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On top of the abolition of the drought funding relief a few months ago, we had the abolition of funds to Lifeline in Toowoomba for rural counselling and the removal of the sugar subsidy. I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  today that some National Party members may cross the floor on this issue. We will wait to see what happens. I commend De-Anne Kelly, a National Party member in the House of Representatives from Mackay, because she probably will cross the floor. She seems to be showing a bit of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guts where many other National Party senators and members simply roll over and let the Liberal Party walk all over them and the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which has affected farmers in Queensland is what looks like the closure of offices of the farm finance services in Maroochydore and Rockhampton through cuts to state legal aid over the next three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the urgency motion moved by Senator Woodley that the Australian government has abandoned Australian farmers. I have to express some disappointment with the wording of the motion. Having sat on many inquiries with Senator Woodley in rural and regional affairs committees, I know he has a genuine interest in Australian agriculture and those who work in it. However, to suggest that the federal government has abandoned Australian farmers and to base those views largely, I suggest, on an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  does not reflect the understanding and interest he has in the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drought is an ongoing concern and an anguish for Australian agriculture. For as long as we have farmed this country, there have been droughts. From my entire term in the Senate, the issue of drought and how governments&mdash;both state and federal&mdash;should manage drought policy have been an ongoing debate. Senator Woodley has participated in many of those debates. I think it ill-behoves him today to bring forward such an emotional worded urgency motion suggesting that this government has abandoned farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to put the decision made by ARMCANZ ministers last week in historical perspective. In May 1989 the previous government established a drought policy review task force to undertake `an independent and comprehensive review of  drought policy in Australia'. They did so because in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1332"> April 1989 the then federal government made the decision to remove drought funding from the national disaster relief arrangements. The task force published two reports. The final three&hyphen;volume report was presented to the government in May 1990. From that report's recommendations, the Labor government adopted a national drought policy in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current drought policy review task force was established under the previous minister, Senator Collins, following an agreement by ARMCANZ ministers in August 1995 to review the national drought policy and the responses to it. It was a high level government, Commonwealth and state, task force involving experts from both state and federal departments of primary industry as well as other co&hyphen;opted experts. On coming to office, Minister Anderson supported its work and the task force reported to ARMCANZ in September last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Commonwealth and state ministers for agriculture agree on the major policy directions for farm business risk management, including the management of drought. The major policy directions agreed to included: to encourage the widespread adoption by primary producers throughout Australia of a self&hyphen;reliant approach to farming risks; to encourage good natural resource management to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural and environmental resource base; to ensure that farm families are provided with the means to secure their welfare requirements; to ensure that desirable ongoing structural adjustment in Australian rural industries is not impeded; and to improve the understanding of drought and drought policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, those concepts are not new. In fact, they are widely endorsed by the rural sector. Over 230 people attended the national rural finance summit last year and they endorsed a number of recommendations that supported exactly that concept&mdash;an environment in which farmers could become self&hyphen;reliant. As the summit clearly demonstrated, farmers want structures in place that will allow them to become better equipped, more self&hyphen;reliant and therefore more financially able to meet the vagaries of farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recurring theme over the three days was that farmers did not want handouts. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanted the government monkeys off their backs; they wanted a stable economic environment. As one of the workshops at the summit concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry and farmers recognise the need for dynamic flexible and responsive farm business structures enabling profitable sustainable and self&hyphen;reliant agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The activating committee established after the summit endorsed those views. The committee's report last week demonstrated quite clearly that farmers recognise the need to become dynamic. They want an economic environment that allows them to do that and they want the right incentives to encourage long&hyphen;term investment in the rural sector, and the government is going that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national drought policy fits well into the criteria that farmers themselves have asked for, because the objective of the national drought policy is to move from a drought reactive approach to a drought preparedness approach. In recent years, commodity downturns, historical high interest rates and other economic factors have prevented farmers from developing this self&hyphen;reliant approach. What we need to ensure is that we now put in place incentives that encourage farmers to prepare for drought and the other downturns, so that they can put away in the good years to prepare for the tough years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of farmers to access funds during a downturn is crucial to the ability of farmers to manage drought and the incentive to put the money away in good times is paramount. I think you agree with that; all the farmers in Australia agree with that. For too long, Australian agriculture has suffered from a lack of clear policy objectives. What this government wants to achieve is more certainty for the farm sector. We want a farm sector equipped to face the challenges of international competition well into the next century. And we are doing that. The minister is currently developing a business plan for agriculture that will establish a broad vision for Australian agriculture and identify key issues which need to be addressed if the rural sector is to capture the significant opportunities now emerging in export markets, especially in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While developing that business plan, this government has not been idle in other areas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1333"> of rural policy. Let me highlight some of the achievements we have made in rural policy alone in the last 12 months. The government has provided additional drought relief in two packages totalling $170 million in its first year in office&mdash;not too bad, I would have thought. This included the extension of drought exceptional circumstances to several parts of New South Wales which previously had been denied assistance, and we modified the drought exceptional circumstances criteria to take greater account of the effectiveness of rain&mdash;something that farmers in the west of New South Wales, in particular, had been arguing for for some time under the previous government. We have extended the standard drought recovery period during which the drought relief payment and the special assessment for Austudy are available after DEC is revoked from six months to 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth, Queensland, Victorian and New South Wales state governments have agreed to provide matching financial assistance for drought regional initiatives totalling $12 million. The Queensland drought regional initiative encompasses 20 projects throughout regional Queensland, which you would know about Senator Woodley, which support on&hyphen;farm activities. The initiative started in September last year with total funding of $5.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, as a Queensland senator you would know that this government has responded quickly and appropriately to assist farmers in your state and to suggest that we have abandoned them, or would abandon them, is scaremongering and petty politics&mdash;something I would have hoped you would be above. In making the announcement last week about the new approach to drought, Minister Anderson said very clearly that the federal government would not walk away from drought relief provisions currently applying in Queensland and New South Wales. So, why the scaremongering?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Progress has been made in a number of other rural areas and the implementation of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill will see many significant projects coming on stream. Landcare will receive additional funding of $279 million over the next five 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. The Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin will receive $163 million to improve water quality and encourage sustainable land use. Work has commenced on a national weeds strategy, a national feral animal control strategy, a national rangelands strategy and a national land and water audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are developing five&hyphen;year plans for the grains industry and the government has worked closely with the wool industry to ensure a more viable future for wool growers and we are making changes to meat industry structures to assist a resurgence of this important sector. An integrated package of reforms has been developed for the sugar industry and, in my own area of responsibility in horticulture, we see an enormous growth in exports with wine and citrus leading the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not abandoned agriculture, Senator Woodley. We have embraced it. Under this government, the rural sector will regain its strength, its viability and its independence. I utterly reject Senator Woodley's assertions and I am confident that, over the course of the next few years, the policies that we are putting in place will provide a sound economic base for true sustainability in the rural sector.</PARA></SPEECH>

Of that, $600 million was committed to drought relief. For the two years that I was in that portfolio there is no question that the major event that overshadowed everything else that happened during that time was what was unarguably the worst and most catastrophic sustained period of drought in the country's history. Certainly in terms of the production lost, it was an all time catastrophe. Indeed, Senator Brownhill has confirmed that it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1334">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my way to the airport last week in the early hours of the morning I listened to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announcing that a new drought policy would be released that coming Friday at ARMCANZ, which interested me. The review process that Senator Brownhill, quite correctly, laid out was the review that I set in train. The purpose of that review, Senator Woodley, was to enhance the drought facility for primary producers, not to cut it to ribbons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After I listened to the minister talking about self-reliance and preparing for drought, all of which I agree with and all of which was the policy of the previous government, there was one thing he did not mention, and neither did Senator Brownhill. That was exceptional circumstances. Treasury and Finance have won again. I can translate this press statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some other things to attend to in Darwin and I had not caught up with the new drought policy. I was keen to pursue it when I got to Canberra. I said to my staff when I arrived, `Have you got a copy of the new drought policy that was announced on Friday?' My staff said to me, `We have a one page press statement that the minister issued on Friday but because it said absolutely nothing, we did not even bother sending it to you in Darwin.' I said, `It must say something.' They said, `No, it doesn't.' I have it here in my hand. Of course, my staff were quite right. I heard the minister on ABC radio announcing that he would be announcing this new policy last Friday&mdash;this brand new approach to drought. It is one page of absolute nothing. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers will have to play an increasing role in achieving self&hyphen;reliance and profitability . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can translate that into English, and so can you, Senator Brownhill. That means, `Don't look to us for what you got in the past, folks.' That is what it says. It also said:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the drought policy is still coming, Senator Woodley; it was not announced on Friday at all. I can translate all that into English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also said&mdash;I was interested to hear this&mdash;that this new drought policy would get away from drawing lines on maps. There is a problem with that. I know the problem with drawing lines on maps. That drought policy, with all of its deficiencies&mdash;I was well aware of them&mdash;was put into place very quickly to get the maximum amount of help on the ground where it was needed very quickly, and it succeeded, Senator Brownhill. If you need any testimony for that, go to Queensland and ask a few primary producers whether they appreciated the drought package being put together so quickly and delivered so quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew that there were problems with lines on maps but, by definition, if it is a drought assistance scheme&mdash;knowing that this country is always either in or out of some kind of drought, knowing that it is commonplace for it to be in drought at one end and flooded at the other, which is currently the situation, and knowing that last year regions of Australia had their wettest period on record and in the same year others had their driest period on record&mdash;and if you are going to provide a drought relief package for drought affected farmers, you have to draw lines on the map somewhere. You cannot apply the assistance to every farmer in Australia. So at some point&mdash;whether it is a regional boundary, a state boundary or a property boundary&mdash;there has to be a line sooner or later where somebody is getting drought assistance and somebody is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I translated all that, and I think accurately, to the fact that this government is about to dump any recognition of exceptional circumstances. That is a recognition by government&mdash;and a very important one, because resources have to flow from that recognition&mdash;that there are sometimes catastrophic natural events in this country that are beyond the capacity of the best managers in Australia to cope with. I defy anybody with a straight face to tell me that that did not occur during that last drought that has thankfully been broken for some significant period of time. It

We are talking about the friends of the farmers&mdash;the so-called natural constituency and the party that rural voters overwhelmingly supported. I was aware that they would at the time.

We did it because it needed to be done. We knew perfectly well that those votes would not flow. We did it because the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, to his great credit, and he meant it, said that we were not going to allow people in these appalling circumstances to fall below the rest of Australia in terms of extending that assistance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to have a look at the approach adopted by the minister for primary industry when he took office. Senator Brownhill said he was going to recount all the achievements in the last 12 months. It was a very short list. I have had a look at the last 12 months with great interest. The minister's approach has been to review absolutely everything. I put a question on notice in May last year about these reviews. Let me tell you, Senator Sandy Macdonald, that there are dozens of them. I asked how they were all going. I would have to say that things are not going all that well. I  refer to one aspect of the answer I received to that question. The answer advised me of the establishment of a special rural task force. Senator West, you know about this task force.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for improved service delivery in social security offices in rural and regional centres is an obvious area of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other recommendations contained in the report will need to be considered by government in the budget context and in conjunction with other reviews such as the rural adjustment scheme review, the national rural finance summit activating committee report, the review of the rural communities access program and the drought policy review task force report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not making that up. That is a government statement. We are all waiting for it. At the end of 12 months, the task force that was supposed to produce a report indicating how farm families were going to access the welfare Senator Brownhill has just had the hide to talk about turned into four more reviews plus the budget process. As I said before, this particular review had pups, but I would not want the pick of the litter, I can tell you. You can keep them all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This one example provides a good insight into how this  new minister is going in this portfolio: very badly is the answer. That answer also referred to the review of the meat industry statutory arrangements. That is jammed&mdash;absolutely jammed. The minister had better move on it fairly quickly or it is all going to start falling apart around the edges. It referred to a review of anti&hyphen;dumping provisions by Mr Lawrie Willett. That happened, but the government, on receiving Mr Willett's report, decided to refer the matter to the Productivity Commission. That is yet to formally happen because the wets and dries in the government cannot agree on the terms of reference for the referral. The restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board is also jammed. It is unfortunate that we have to lump the national drought policy into that basket of reviews, despite the fact that the matter has been before the ministerial council for some time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of this debate, I would like to enter a disclaimer that, as a cattle producer and a grazier, I have probably benefited&mdash;or my family has from time to time&mdash;from drought relief measures, principally in the form of freight subsidies on fodder in times of drought. We have had a major drought in Central Queensland for the last six years, so I have some first&hyphen;hand experience of it. This year alone in the wet season we have probably had about 4&half; or five inches of rain against a normal average of anywhere between 15 and 25 inches. So it looks like we are going to move into a seventh year of drought. This motion is really quite an extraordinary one. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abandonment of Australian farmers by the Federal Government as demonstrated by the refusal of the Queensland Government to sign the new National Drought Policy which slashes tens of millions of dollars from future drought funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The business about abandonment of Australian farmers by the federal government is a non&hyphen;sequitur. In the first place, no federal government is responsible for any action of a state government. I fail to see the connection in that. But, as Senator Brownhill so eloquently pointed out, none of it is true&mdash;not remotely true. You have got to excuse it as being another cheap, headline grabbing attempt by the Democrats to get a bit of publicity and try to win a few votes in the bush. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Democrats have never had as their spokesman in the party anyone from any of the rural industries of Australia with any first&hyphen;hand experience. Although Senator Woodley tries hard, his claim to knowing something about conditions in the bush is the fact that he has driven through them, probably, some time or other. That is about as relevant as me claiming, because I own a car, that I represent or am involved in the motor industry. It is just not true. Senator Woodley has got to acquire a depth of knowledge: he has got to get some information about those industries and have some contact with them, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1337"> otherwise he simply does not earn any respect for his point of view in the community at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the debate so far has been the usual exuberant&mdash;to put it euphemistically&mdash;approach from Senator Collins. I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of Senator Collins's interest in rural activities. The only problem he has is, like Senator Woodley, a shortage of first&hyphen;hand knowledge of what goes on. Yet he comes in and tries to defend the 13 years of neglect that the Labor Party inflicted on rural Australia after the indifference that they showed while we went through droughts, poor commodity prices and all the other afflictions we have had. The last five to 10 years have quite probably been the hardest time for rural industries ever since Federation. It is a bit rich for Senator Collins now to berate the government for the constructive moves they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor we saw greatly increased operational costs for all rural activities. We saw the enormously high inflation they stacked up. We saw high interest rates, up to 20 per cent, applied to property owners trying to cope with droughts and poor market prices. We saw a total inability to tackle labour relations, the consequence of that being very high oncosts for rural producers. Packaging costs in Australia are 40 per cent higher than they are in the US or the UK. Productivity of the labour market in food processing is only 40 per cent of what it is in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in relation to abattoirs is also a classic example. Productivity in the US is about three times ours. We saw high costs in transport. The sale of abattoirs that the Labor Party supported without any hindrance saw most Australian meat processing facilities move into overseas hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had the nonsense of the fringe benefits tax being applied to the rural community. The rural community is not an area where a fringe benefits tax has much application at all. There is a valid case to stop evasion in the form of benefits being paid to urban dwellers by way of salary packages, in business and the rest of it. That is a valid application of the fringe benefits tax, but rural Australia really suffers enormously through the imposition of a fringe benefits tax because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in so many ways benefits are given in return for wages. It is a lifestyle that has developed for well over 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor government do? It announced the national drought policy in 1992. Under this policy drought was recognised as a normal feature and farmers were to adopt improved risk management strategies. The rural adjustment scheme was to be used as the major vehicle for encouraging families. Hardship resulting from severe drought was to be addressed through the exceptional circumstances provision of the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on implementing this policy the Labor government failed to put in place transitional arrangements for the tens of thousands of farmers who simply did not have the resources needed to manage risk. Prior to the partial adoption of the national drought policy of 1992, Labor had rendered income equalisation deposits ineffective. Consequently, they were not used by farmers during the better years at the end of the 1980s, when reserves could have been set aside for future risk management. When we were in government previously, something like $2 billion was involved in deposits under the IED scheme, but in the last two years they have been probably as low as $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, since 1989, when Labor removed drought from the natural disaster relief arrangements, there has been no federal assistance available to farmers experiencing drought. In addition, the Labor government's national draft policy did not contain any support measures to ensure farmers experiencing severe drought beyond their capacity to manage were able to feed, clothe and educate their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done? This government has done quite a lot. We had the announcement on 16 August 1996 of $5.264 million for the drought regional initiative for Queensland. We had the announcement on 4 November of the $1.5 million support for the rural adjustment scheme. We had the drought relief payment scheme recovery package extended. We had the availability of Austudy for eligible families in DEC revoked areas extended, as with access to family payments, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1338"> parenting allowance and health care cards. We saw the appointment of rural financial counsellors and a whole range of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the $1.5 million package of drought recovery assistance later on in December. As the minister said in his press release on 28 February&mdash;Senator Brownhill made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I make it clear the federal government will not walk away from drought relief provisions currently applying in Queensland and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We want our policy to ensure that rural producers are able to minimise&mdash;not eliminate but minimise&mdash;the effects of drought, flood and fire. Australia is different from other agricultural countries. The United Kingdom, Europe and America do not suffer the great floods, the great fires and the great droughts that we do. We need to put policies in place, which is what this government is doing, to make rural producers more self-reliant. Unlike the Democrat policy, we are not asking for low interest long-term loans or anything like that. We are asking for the resources we have in good years to be available to see us through the bad years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

That is a little bit of a worry. It indicates to people just what farmers are thinking. The minister's colleague in Queensland is obviously a little more in touch with his grassroots than the federal minister is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to look in a historical sense at what the former government did in the last few years in relation to drought. The drought response measures were consistent with principles that recognised the inevitability of drought and the need for farmers to adopt a self-reliant approach, with drought support being provided by the Commonwealth under only exceptional circumstances and state based subsidies being phased out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conjunction with that, we were about introducing and doing drought research, drought preparedness, and drought management and support. On the research side, we introduced a number of programs that would support drought related research, including improving climatic forecasting and land, water and crop pasture management. In relation to drought preparedness, we had IEDs and FMBs, which provided incentives for saving income surpluses in good years for utilisation in bad years. We had taxation measures to better physically manage the impact. We had the rural adjustment scheme to support and implement farm productivity measures, including drought preparedness measures such as silage pits. We had landcare programs for improving land and water management, including for the impact of drought. We had rural counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the drought management and support side, we had the normal rural adjustment scheme providing productivity support during the drought recovery phase. We had the exceptional circumstances scheme, which provided enhanced productivity and re-establishment support to assist farm businesses to maintain themselves throughout drought. We had the drought relief payment and associated measures, which were targeted to a number of farm families most in need. It provided them with income and it allowed them access to education assistance and to health assistance. As I said, we had the rural counselling service and the drought recovery and management facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of things the previous government did, under the former minister who has already spoken. They were well received on the whole in the areas. They were very well received not just by the farmers but by the farming communities. Many of the communities recognised that, when the farmers were assisted and had money to pay a number of their bills and to purchase food, they were enabling a cashflow to be generated within the community and that helped the whole of the community. So it is important to look at what the previous government has done. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1339">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to look at what the coalition's policy was on this issue before they came into power. In relation to exceptional circumstances, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While farmers can . . . be expected to provide for income deficiencies caused by what could be described as "normal" fluctuations in climate and prices, the same cannot be said for "exceptional circumstances".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these situations, special Government measures are justified to ensure the survival of viable farmers and maintain the nation's capacity to produce and export farm produce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not applied the drought "exceptional circumstances" provisions uniformly or fairly, leading to major inequities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There were some problems, as the former minister has already outlined. But that does not mean you chuck the whole program out, which is what this lot look like they are doing. The policy continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the scheduled review of the RAS during 1996, we will examine administrative arrangements to ensure they are not discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The policy says that they would also `consider whether the "exceptional circumstances" provisions should be triggered in situations where a series of events occurs which are not exceptional in isolation, but are in their cumulative effect'. They are the sorts of things they were talking about in their policy document. This was a policy document of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also said they were going to be `working with the states to develop a consistent definition of and administrative arrangements for drought "exceptional circumstances"'. They were obviously going to work closely with the states. It is pretty apparent from the comments of the Queensland minister that they did not work too closely with the states because he is pretty angry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the whole show. He is very angry, in fact. On 5 February last year, obviously during the election campaign, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to drought and exceptional circumstances, we will maintain and improve the national drought policy and ensure that exceptional circumstances provisions are administered in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They talk about farm savings reserve schemes. Most farmers that I am talking to these days are complaining because they are having difficulty having some sort of income. The wool industry is struggling; the beef industry is struggling; wheat prices are down; there is a whole range of these things. Farmers are telling me that their income levels are such that they are not able at this stage to put any money away. It has been only 12 months or less in some areas since the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak on this urgency motion and deal with a number of matters. I would like to begin first of all by quoting from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national drought policy</EMPHASIS> , a report prepared by the Senate Standing Committee of Rural and Regional Affairs in July 1992. One obviously cannot go into this in detail, but on page xii it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the Commonwealth Government should provide effective financial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incentives for primary producers to prepare and manage for drought.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who was on that committee? Senator Burns, Senator Brownhill, Senator Bell, Senator Calvert, Senator Crane, Senator Reynolds, Senator Sherry and&mdash;would you believe it after what we just heard&mdash;Senator West.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this policy is about and what I believe the previous government was hoping to do at that time was to put that into place. That is the direction in which drought policy in this country at this time is moving. There are a number of misconceptions about this. First of all I want to deal with this motion, which Senator Brownhill and Senator MacGibbon have already addressed some aspects of. The motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abandonment of Australian farmers by the Federal Government as demonstrated by the refusal of the Queensland Government to sign the new National Drought Policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say: one, it is very hard to make sense out of it; two, it is an absolute nonsense; and, three, no state government has signed it. It was decided last week, when discussions were held, that further discussions, which I will come to in a moment or two, on a number of aspects of that policy were to continue and then be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion before us today, with all due respect to you Senator Woodley, is not sensible. You have been quite sensible on the rural committee, on which I have worked with you. In fact, it is quite unbelievable that you should bring forward a motion such as this. I believe it is more about trying to create an atmosphere to assist you in your preselection for the coming Senate election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be rather surprised if the Democrats were going to challenge you, Senator Woodley. On what particular aspect? I do not know. I do not get involved in these things in Queensland as far as Democrat senators are concerned. I think you would have done yourself a service if you had checked out the facts of the current position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from Senator Bob Collins&mdash;`I'll pat myself on the back. I did a pretty good job when I was minister in dealing with the situation when exceptional circumstances arose.' We have acknowledged that in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1341"> place. Also in talking about exceptional circumstances, he mentioned the 25-year drought. We have the 10-year drought, the 40-year drought and the 100-year drought, which is what is generally talked about&mdash;I had not heard about the 25-year drought, but the number of years does not concern me very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is generally considered that the drought in the 1990s was in the category of the 100-year drought. It was also considered that the drought in the final years of the Fraser government was in that same category. In both instances, the federal governments reacted&mdash;one a Liberal government and one a Labor government&mdash;at that particular time to the circumstances in which they found themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to everybody in this chamber, if we have in 10 years time, 20 years time or 100 years time similar circumstances in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia or anywhere else in this country, you would get a similar reaction to those circumstances at that time.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bob Collins" NAMEID="UNKNOWN">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had two 100-year droughts in 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is because of the terminology used to measure the severity of the drought. That is how they are measured. You would need to recognise that the input of the Fraser government would have been worth more, I believe, in real terms than the input of your government. I have not done those figures. I am making the point that, when governments are confronted with these situations, they react accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time I have available to me here, I wish to deal with some of the things still under discussion in relation to this. This is the point that Senator Woodley needs to bear in mind when he moves these motions. One that I certainly would agree with is the first one&mdash;the value of the farm savings reserve scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that this report does deal with is IEDs. To the shame of the Labor Party&mdash;and I particularly mention here ex-Senator Peter Walsh&mdash;we did have what I believe was a very good IED scheme in place. If you look at the figures for that IED scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at that particular time, you will see that it was attractive to farmers who invested in their good years. It was decimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West said that wheat prices are down. They might not be as high as they were last year, but they are the second highest on record so far as grain is concerned. People need the opportunity to put some money away and that was destroyed. One of the most important things that we can do as a parliament in terms of drought is to allow people to prepare themselves. That is recognised in the report and that has been a thing which we have all spoken of many times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point that was raised that is still being discussed and dealt with is the time frame for the exceptional circumstances measures. Spelt out very clearly in a number of press releases from the minister is the intent to allow exceptional circumstances to continue as they exist in areas that are currently declared as drought affected under those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can go through these particular aspects and the decisions, but I do not have time to continue, so I will wind up my comments. The one thing we have done for people both in drought and not in drought is to address the problems that exist in this country with interest rates mainly because of spending more money than we earned as a nation during the years of the previous Labor government. We have seen the results of our change of policy. I quote this because it is very instructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People with $500,000 debt, which is not a lot in the farm sector today, because of the drop in interest rates which has occurred&mdash;and people in drought areas are particularly affected by this&mdash;already have had savings of some $7,500  and it is higher than that per property. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 11 bills that were referred to the committee form a comprehensive package of legislation designed to establish the regulatory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1343"> framework for telecommunications in Australia from 1 July 1997 onwards. The bills contain 826 pages of legislation as well as the associated explanatory memoranda. They were referred to the committee on 10 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objectives of the post&hyphen;1997 regulatory framework are to facilitate the development of an Australian telecommunications industry based on: world class infrastructure using the latest market driven technology mix; a multitude of service providers offering diverse and innovative carriage and content services; and contestable market strategies which drive prices down and quality of service up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was advertised in the national press on 14 and 18 December 1996. It was also advertised on the Internet via the Senate World Wide Web homepage from 13 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received 88 written submissions and a number of additional supplementary submissions from a broad range of individuals and organisations. Following the closing date for submissions, the committee also received a large number of correspondence about unfounded rumours that it might be persuaded by Telstra to allow the imposition of timed charges on local data calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee held public hearings on 29 and 30 January 1997, and on 7, 14 and 18 February 1997 at Parliament House, Canberra. A total of 91 witnesses appeared before the committee, many of them appearing on multiple occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report follows the structure of the bills. The committee's recommendations are considered in order of the section of the bills to which they refer. Chapter 9 of the report considers issues which do not fit clearly into any of the individual bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the time constraints faced by the committee, it was not possible to report on all of the issues raised during the inquiry. The report deals only with those issues where committee members have recommended specific amendments to legislation or other measures dealing with a particular area of concern. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some issues which were the subject of numerous submissions and considerable discussion during the hearings are therefore not discussed in this report. Although the committee spent considerable time examining all of the evidence put to it, on many occasions it decided not to recommend any changes to the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a large degree, the broad rationale of the proposed arrangements is accepted by all stakeholders. The committee's intention was therefore not to re&hyphen;open debate on broad issues of policy but rather to ensure that the bills provide for the implementation of the policy intentions in a workable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry found that the telecommunications package of bills will effectively regulate the post&hyphen;1 July 1997 telecommunications regime. They will provide the framework for an open telecommunications market while establishing world&hyphen;class consumer safeguard arrangements. The committee has therefore recommended that the bills be passed, subject to those amendments contained in its report and any drafting problems which may come to light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report contains recommendations, most of which provide for specific amendments to the legislative package. These recommendations will help the Senate to finetune a very complex, but well prepared, package of legislation. In particular, improvements are proposed in regard to the following matters: carrier and service provider regulation; the universal service obligation; untimed local calls; emergency call services; privacy matters; industry development; carriers' powers and immunities; competition regulation; transitional arrangements; re&hyphen;allocation of radiocommunications spectrum; the definition of the standard telephone service; and specific provisions to facilitate telecommunications access for people with disabilities. The committee is confident that the amendments proposed in this report represent an appropriate balance of industry and community interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a few brief comments on the way the inquiry was managed. This inquiry was very well run by the committee secretariat. I would like to acknowledge the high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1344"> standard of the material that was prepared for the committee members, and the competent management of the inquiry process. I am sure that the other committee members would join me in thanking all of the committee staff who contributed to this inquiry for their efforts. I believe that the conduct of this inquiry sets a good example for the running of other bills' inquiries dealing with major, technically difficult legislation. I will therefore take a few moments to describe some aspects of the conduct of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions for this inquiry were provided to senators and witnesses in bound, page numbered volumes. This meant that throughout the hearings both the committee members and the witnesses were able to find quickly the relevant page of a submission without having to shuffle through mountainous piles of loose paper&mdash;and anybody who has been on a committee which has had a large number of submissions will remember how those submissions appear in your office tied with pink ribbon and, after you have fossicked through them, to re-establish some sort of order is beyond reason. So this was a tremendous system for which I thank the committee. This approach contributed significantly to both the smooth flow of public hearings and the preparation of the report. In the committee hearing itself, you were able to refer to a page number and everyone knew what you were talking about&mdash;and that has not always been the case with some other hearings I have participated in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the public hearings, the briefing material was equally well presented. It was divided into the key issues raised with the committee and summarised the main points raised in all the submissions on that issue. This enabled the committee members to identify quickly the main points of contention between witnesses and to focus their questioning on those key points. So what I am saying here is that the briefing material also was well presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public hearings were programmed to deal with subject areas which had received prominence in submissions. The committee questioned the witnesses on each subject area collectively. Up to 18 witnesses appeared before the committee simultaneously during 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the hearings. Although this approach required witnesses concerned with multiple subject areas to make multiple appearances, it enabled greater elucidation of issues than would have been the case if witnesses were called to appear separately before the committee. Only by using this form was the committee able to hear the views of the large number of witnesses who appeared before it in the very limited time available. This format also enabled the committee to identify quickly the main areas of disagreement between the witnesses and to focus on those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The round table approach placed unusual demands on the committee secretariat and extraordinary demands on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters. I would like to thank both the committee secretariat and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters who were involved for their cooperation in what sometimes was not an easy task in determining who was speaking and getting some order out of what could have been chaotic. But we managed, and I think it provided another model for the approach to a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the hearings, Mr Tony Shaw, Mr Rohan Buettel and other senior officers of DOCA were present at the witness table. Again, this is not a usual practice. They were able to provide immediate responses to many of the concerns raised by the witnesses. This added greatly to the effectiveness of the inquiry. I would like to acknowledge publicly the committee's appreciation of the assistance they provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the hearings on 14 February, the committee took evidence from witnesses representing Australians with a hearing impairment. I understand that this was the first occasion on which a Senate committee has taken evidence from witnesses with a hearing impairment through sign interpreters. The evidence they gave the committee on their concerns about telecommunications was very valuable. I was glad the committee was able to find the time to give them a hearing. I would like to thank the Sound and Vision Office for assisting the committee to take evidence from these witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, provided considerable assistance to the committee. He made himself 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1345"> available to the committee on three occasions for private briefings on the bills. He provided additional resources to the committee to help it deal with the more technical aspects of the bills, and he also gave the committee very detailed comments on all of the amendments suggested in the submissions to the committee. I would like to thank him and both his and his department's staff for their assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would also like to thank Senator Short who took over as chairman of the committee while I was otherwise engaged on parliamentary business visiting the Antarctic bases. He got the committee's inquiry off to an excellent start. I thank him very much for his contribution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition to this motion to take note of the report of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on the package of telecommunications bills, which were introduced into this parliament in 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get to the opposition's minority report, we want to place on record the opposition's appreciation of the staff of the secretariat. In my own minority report I list all the staff. In view of the complexity of this package of bills, I can only pay the secretariat the highest compliment for their preparation work for the committee in briefing notes and drafting the report. The report is, despite the complexity of the issues, I believe, quite readable and will become a very useful source of information to the broader telecommunications community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) allowed a couple of staff from his department to serve on the committee. They served the committee loyally and did very well. I also have to make particular reference to Frank Nugent, the secretary of this inquiry, who did so well in preparing the material for us. All staff on that committee secretariat deserve full compliments and congratulations from the senators on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to briefly mention, as Senator Patterson did, the unique feature of this inquiry, and that is the way this legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee enabled the various parties and interest groups to appear before it and speak to their submissions. This was not a references committee inquiry; this was a legislation committee inquiry. When the legislation came before the parliament late last year, I suggested to the minister that the way to stop a plethora of amendments to such complex legislation from all sorts of interest groups, which would be very confusing to deal with in the normal committee stage of the Senate, would be to refer it straight off to the legislation committee, call for submissions and ask those who put submissions in to detail their amendments and have those debated before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To enable that to happen in a manner which would expedite the work of the committee, we encouraged people to come and sit at the table. We sometimes had as many as 10 different interest groups around the table. I think this has gone beyond what any other committee has tried and it was an outstanding success. I recommend this process to other legislation committees. It was valuable to all senators to hear the arguments of various interest groups at the same time so that we could more quickly get to the nub of an issue. When Telstra and Optus were arguing over interconnect fees or price discrimination, having them arguing the points back and forth enabled senators&mdash;particularly, I have to say, me&mdash;to get more quickly to a view about who had a more correct argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that worked extremely well. I also have to compliment the departmental officers who sat there through most of those hearings. Mr Tony Shaw and his officers were able to pass comment on what the views of the department and the government were on the various submissions. I think the process is to be commended. I would commend it to the Senate overall. I think the Procedure Committee of the Senate, if that is the appropriate committee, ought to have a look at the style of this operation and recommend it&mdash;even if it means juggling a few standing orders of the operation of committees. I believe this process will make the committee stage of the Senate work better.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1346">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition overwhelmingly supports the 500 or 600 pages of these bills&mdash;explanatory memorandum and second reading speeches. The process of these bills was started when we were in government, particularly by Mr Michael Lee, the then Minister for Communications and the Arts. The changes made by the new government during 1996 were marginal; they did not change the general thrust of the bills, and the opposition continues to overwhelmingly support that general thrust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to the work that Michael Lee did as the minister who started this process. I also want to pay tribute to the various interest groups who contributed to the process when we were in government and who continued to work with Minister Alston to get to the stage we were at when these bills were introduced last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general thrust of the bill is within the philosophy that we adopted in government and but we are dealing now with what I call fine tuning, but in some significant areas. That has led the opposition to make a number of amendments to the legislation. I do not think the amendments, in some areas, are too far away from what the government is proposing. The opposition still offers to participate with the government over the next week or so, until the committee stage starts, in negotiations to see whether we can reach common ground on the areas where the report has indicated there are still some differences between government senators, the Labor opposition and the Democrats, who have also put in a minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it ought to be noted that, despite the differences of opinion between the different parties on the Senate committee, there was an enormous amount of goodwill in the discussion across a whole range of issues. There was a lot of give and take when people found that they were not ideological issues at stake but more practical and commonsense issues on what is the best way for this new regime to work from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition indicates that, via its amendments, it will strongly support the continuation of untimed local phone calls for both voice and data for business customers and residential customers. We will also put in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> separate recommendation to guarantee regional residential customers that, as far as possible, their local call charges will be the same as those call charges&mdash;which will be dropping in the competitive market&mdash;of the metropolitan areas of Australia. We do not want to see local calls in the metropolitan areas of Australia dropping to 20c per untimed local call and the rural areas still paying 25c for their untimed local call. We think the competition impact should flow through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a difference of opinion in our amendment compared with the government's. I hope that, during the discussions over the next 10 days, we may be able to reach common ground on that. If we do not, there will have to be a debate in the Senate about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest issue, which that had most submissions from the broader community, was that of immunities in relation to infrastructure and roll out. I think we cannot disagree with what the government has put forward in a number of areas. Local government organisations and the local community for the first time will have the right to appeal against the construction of major infrastructure in their area. If they cannot reach agreement with a carrier, either the carrier or the local community or the local government body can go through an appeal process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has a different view from the government in that we do not believe it necessary to allow the state governments to impose, in between the local government and the federal provisions, a new provision, a new code and a new planning process. We believe that will create delays, add extra cost and will not achieve, in the end, a speeding up of the process. In our view, what it will do is lead to Australia having eight different planning codes for telecommunications. We do not believe we ought to go down that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There ought to be one simple planning regulation. If the community disagrees with it, they have the right to appeal, as we recommend, to the Australian Communications Authority as the final arbitrator, which can balance the local interests and local issues against the national interest of having a national telecommunications system. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1347"> believe that is a very important amendment, and we will strongly push that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that industry development plans should be mandatory and have a sanction on the carriers so that the Australian industry can develop. We also believe that there should be a long-term plan arranged so that those communities that presently have overhead telecommunications cables on poles know that over the long-term there is a plan to get them underground. We will strongly push that issue as well. In the second reading debate and then in the committee stage, we will explain further our amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee but, rather than devote my comments specifically to the recommendations that the opposition senators are making, I would like to comment more generally on some of the outcomes of this particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that really was highlighted through this whole process was the nature of the development of technology with respect to telecommunications. What we got, as elected representatives, was a very good insight as to exactly where Australia is going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with its telecommunications infrastructure, not only with respect to telephony and facsimile services, as we currently are used to, but also the future directions of other telecommunications services, particularly those relating to the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the particular issues of concern was, of course, untimed local data calls. During the inquiry a lot of time was spent analysing and considering the impacts upon the imposition of perhaps a regulation providing for the maintenance of untimed local data calls, whether it be in respect of the residential or business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague Senator Schacht said, we on the opposition side are firmly in favour of the maintenance of untimed data calls in both the residential and business sector. This is all good and well but, when you analyse why we have taken this position, it is important to understand that we cannot consider data calls in the old context. We have to consider data calls and how those calls will be used in the future. With 40 per cent of Australian homes now with a PC, it is not an unreasonable expectation that some time in the future a far greater percentage than those currently connected to the Internet will be connected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the business side, more and more Australian businesses everyday are becoming connected to the Internet. Charging for timed connections for Internet service providers will impinge upon their ability and affordability to access that telecommunications service. I believe very strongly that in the interests of access to the forms of technology that are becoming more widely used in the Australian community we have to preserve the untimed call provision for both local residents and local businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I would like to mention in a broad context is that of spectrum allocation. In the context of this report, the nature of spectrum allocation with the current reallocation process occurring was discussed very widely. Once again, it is an issue that goes to the heart of trying as legislators to anticipate where future technologies are going to emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contemplating the factors of this particular set of bills, we need to be able to antici 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1348"> pate technological developments but not confine or restrict this legislation to any specific technology. It has been quite a fine line to provide for the scope necessary to allow new technologies to emerge and become part of the competitive market while still putting in place the appropriate safeguards to ensure that all consumers have access to the affordable and appropriate type of communication networks as they become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one other thing that really comes to fruition with the outcome of this inquiry is that with this set of technical bills there were so many areas to canvass there was a lot of common ground between all parties. There were around seven areas, as Senator Schacht said, in which Labor has a different view. By and large, the government was prepared to accept many of the issues put before it by various interest groups and industry players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see the nature of evidence that came before the committee. Not only did we have the standard responses or submissions of industry players, existing carriers, but the quality of the submissions from the various industry representative groups, whether it be from Internet users or service providers or groups representing consumers in a certain area, says so much about where Australia is at with telecommunications and information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is starting to dawn on certainly all the senators present on this inquiry, and I think it is starting to dawn on the government, that Australia is uniquely positioned with respect to our developing information technology industry. We are very strongly placed in our global region, but we are also quite capable as a nation to really seize the opportunity to become a leader in the development of information technology. This is where Labor feels very strongly about the necessity of providing for sanctions to make the carriers commit themselves to a decisive industry development plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our recommendations that differed from the government's was to impose such sanctions upon the provision and implementation of industry development plans of the various licence holders. In that regard I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what we need to be saying to the industry is that this government and this parliament wants to see that industry expand, see the potential and be able to use it, not languish with some decrepit old legislative structure within which carriers and new technology providers struggle. We need a regime that allows development to flourish, that utilises the potential of this country's innovative companies who are now proving their potential in the export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think as a result of this inquiry we are all much better informed as to the depth of the innovation that we are  capable of in this country. I urge all senators who have not taken the opportunity to peruse some of the submissions to this particular inquiry to do so. They should take note of this expertise, of this unique position that we are in, and apply that knowledge and that insight not just in the context of what is, by and large, a relatively dry set of technical pieces of legislation but apply it in a far more innovative way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to recognise that it does not only impact upon that particular sector of industry; but, as someone recently put it, information technology is an enabling industry. It is not an industry that is insular. It enables all other Australian industries to be able to obtain some advantage. It supports them and enhances their position in the global market. So when we talk about the telecommunications industry or information technology we should be thinking as a parliament, as legislators, of not just the confines and the scope of the potential of the industry itself&mdash;which is huge&mdash;but also in the context that it enables the rest of Australian industry to advance itself to a point that would give us some advantage in a competitive global market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, the thing I found so heartening about this inquiry was the level of new ideas and innovation that came forth through the submissions. A lot of the submissions dealt with quite specific amendments but a lot of submissions came through with some new ideas that were a bit too radical, I think, for us legislators to get a grip on at this point in time. But as our knowledge improves about new technologies, about the Internet, about the global communications revolution that is

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a central plank of the package of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other main bills in the package are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996; and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Completing the package is the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, to amend the multitude of other Commonwealth Acts that connect with the Audit Act in a variety of ways. It provides the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current, aging and inadequate financial framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 is designed to achieve a number of related purposes: foremost, is the re&hyphen;establishment of the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General of the Commonwealth of Australia, but in a way that both symbolically and practically strengthens the functional independence of the Office beyond that available under current laws. The bill declares the Auditor&hyphen;General to be an "independent officer of the parliament", as an expression of the primary and unique relationship which the Office has with the parliament. In keeping with the government's publicly&hyphen;stated commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the Auditor&hyphen;General, a range of statutory safeguards are included in the bill to prevent inappropriate influence being exerted on the Auditor&hyphen;General by either the Executive or the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's other main purposes are to specify, clarify and broaden the powers and functions of the Auditor&hyphen;General as the external auditor of all Commonwealth bodies; to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency; and to provide, in turn, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the provisions in this bill reflect the significant and valuable work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in pressing for a strengthening of the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General. The JCPA, following its comprehensive 1988 inquiry into the operations of the Auditor&hyphen;General, produced Report 296, entitled "The Auditor&hyphen;General: Ally of the People and parliament". The committee recommended profound changes to the Auditor&hyphen;General's operations, including that the Audit Act to be replaced with more modern legislation. Subsequently, the recommendations arising from JCPA Reports 331 and 346 allowed further shape to be added to the bill as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should mention that the government has accepted the proposition that the JCPA assume the additional role of `Audit Committee of the parliament'. Appropriate changes to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to that effect are included in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, and are complemented by provisions in the Auditor&hyphen;General bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now wish to provide an outline of the Auditor&hyphen;General bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In establishing the Office of Auditor&hyphen;General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the bill details the processes of appointment and conditions of the Office. As a statutory office&hyphen;holder, the Auditor&hyphen;General will continue to be appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General on the recommendation of the appropriate minister&mdash;whom the Administrative Arrangements Orders, are expected to continue to specify as the Prime minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor&hyphen;General of the proposed appointee, that minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement to the proposal. That is, the parliament&mdash;through the JCPA&mdash;is to have the right of veto over the government's choice of Auditor&hyphen;General. The bill also retains the current safeguards for the removal of the Auditor&hyphen;General by the Governor&hyphen;General following a petition by both Houses of the parliament in the same session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General is to have a broad mandate enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor&hyphen;General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor&hyphen;General will have a mandate to audit the financial statements of, and conduct performance audits on, all Commonwealth bodies. For bodies that are government Business Enterprises, in recognition of the fact that they are subject to the overlaying accountability framework that requires them to pursue optimal market performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder, the Auditor&hyphen;General would not subject them to performance audits unless requested by parliament&mdash;through the JCPA&mdash;or a minister. If the body concerned is a partially privatised Commonwealth company, however, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. In this regard, the government has reflected on the need to continue the principle, as already accepted under the Audit Act 1901, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in such companies. Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders. To avoid the claim that, through imposing this extra tier of performance auditing, the Commonwealth was, thus, `oppressing' the minority private shareholders, the Auditor&hyphen;General's surveillance over the operations of partially privatised Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1351"> companies is to be exclusively as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to permit the Auditor&hyphen;General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them, or to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor&hyphen;General and be undertaken if it is within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so, and the Auditor&hyphen;General considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with exclusive functional responsibility to the Auditor&hyphen;General. The government sees the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority as an important symbolic step to demonstrate our commitment to the functional independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of the fact that auditing the operations of the Executive is a core service to the public through the parliament. Should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor&hyphen;General's flexibility to engage any person&mdash;for example, to contract with auditors or other specialists from the private sector&mdash;to assist in the performance of an Auditor&hyphen;General function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that the Auditor&hyphen;General and authorised officials have full and free access to information and documents in the performance of mandated functions. These powers are considerable in their scope, but are necessary if the Auditor&hyphen;General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor&hyphen;General function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also seeks to re&hyphen;establish the office of Independent Auditor who is the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the Office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor&hyphen;General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Independent Auditor is to be a part&hyphen;time statutory officer appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General on the advice of the appropriate minister&mdash;again, this is expected to be the Prime minister&mdash;with the JCPA having the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee as it does in the selection of Auditor&hyphen;General. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already indicated, the government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other bills in the package provide the statutory environment in which the Auditor&hyphen;General&mdash;with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task&mdash;can fulfil, fearlessly and independently, the role demanded by parliament on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General plays a vital role in giving credibility to Australia's system of parliamentary governance and this legislation will preserve and strengthen that role.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, together with the other two main bills that are part of this package&mdash;namely, the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996, will replace the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing with some of the details included in this bill, it is important to point out the boundaries of coverage over the Commonwealth's financial affairs that will be established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. In relation to financial administration, every Commonwealth body falls into one of two categories, according to the basic legal financial status that each body has. It either has the legal capacity, in its own right, by virtue of its incorporating legislation, to acquire ownership of money or other assets coming into its possession; or the body will function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity that is the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of the money and assets it deals with on the Commonwealth's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to apply to the operations of bodies that fall into the first category&mdash;that is, financially autonomous incorporated Commonwealth bodies that can acquire legal ownership of money in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is to apply to the second category of bodies that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is concerned, therefore, with establishing the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It specifies responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it provides for appropriate mecha 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1352"> nisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and, thereby, allow them to be held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed law will provide a legislative framework for effective and accountable financial management that is not only matched to the public sector environment of today, but a framework that will also be flexible enough to meet the evolutionary changes to Commonwealth financial management practices that the future will inevitably bring. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve, clarify and strengthen the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definitions of "Agency", "Chief Executive", "official", "public money" and "public property", between them, describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation&mdash;regulations and Finance Minister's Orders&mdash;to provide procedural substance for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act 1901 for regulations and Finance Directions, except that, unlike Finance Directions which are administrative in character, provision is made for Finance Minister's Orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which Chief Executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act will preserve the role of the Minister for Finance, as central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The Finance Minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the Constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth', so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that Office. The Finance Minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money; to make Orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money; and to its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act 1901 to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short term cash management tools&mdash;overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> represented by credit card and Cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by Parliament through appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The Trust Fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act 1901 is to be abolished and replaced by two, purpose&hyphen;based, Funds&mdash;the Reserved Money Fund and the Commercial Activities Fund. Apart from components of the Reserved Money Fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two Funds will be established or varied by Finance Minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or Loan Fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent. Since the spending of money from such a Fund is, in all respects, an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the Finance Minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of Parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of Trust Accounts under the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments of public money, including debiting a Fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of "Drawing Rights", to be issued by the Finance Minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by Parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the Executive Government to spend, always specify the Fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a timeframe. It would be a breach of section 83 of the Constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the Finance Minister has no capacity to issue valid Drawing Rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law; and makes it an indictable offence for an official or Minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid Drawing Right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act would put into the principal legislation the powers that are presently carried only in Finance Regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for Parliamentary Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Audit Act 1901 is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1353"> seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on Chief Executives of Agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their Agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish Audit Committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the Finance Minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, it is proposed that Chief Executives be permitted to sub&hyphen;delegate to officials any of the act's Finance Minister's powers or functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such sub&hyphen;delegation. These arrangements for sub&hyphen;delegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief Executives are better placed than the Finance Minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold Chief Executives accountable to the Finance Minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the Finance Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposed law will be a lever for much&hyphen;needed change to sharpen and strengthen the framework of Commonwealth financial administration.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 is one of the main bills in the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial trigger for this bill is the necessity to replace Part XI of the Audit Act which currently provides standard financial, reporting and auditing provisions for Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, only about two thirds of Commonwealth authorities rely on Part XI of the Audit Act. The rest, instead, have their own financial, reporting and auditing provisions. Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements in so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. Consequently, at present we have a myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the statute book and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace all of these diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach proposed will enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the government's and the Parliament's interest in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the bill's requirements relating to Commonwealth authorities are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important feature of the bill is that it extends the mandate of the Auditor&hyphen;General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries. At the same time it will modernise the requirements for the Auditor&hyphen;General's reports on the financial statements of authorities and make them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will have become apparent from what I have already said that, in some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the establishing legislation of authorities and the constitutional documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the establishing legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 which is part of this package of bills. Similarly, it is intended that areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies be replaced with cross&hyphen;references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the bill, a `Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A `Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct controlling interest&mdash;that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor&hyphen;General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the Parliament. However, only `wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies&mdash;those other provisions are essentially concerned with the furnishing of information to ministers and keeping them informed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This distinction between "wholly&hyphen;owned" and other Commonwealth companies reflects the difficulty&mdash;in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders&mdash;of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1354">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor&hyphen;General on the financial statements. The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders; the directors and the Auditor&hyphen;General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a `true and fair view' of the matters required to be reported. I should mention that the Finance Minister's Orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the Parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report which the minister must, in turn, table in each House of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill which I will briefly mention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Finance Minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies to prepare half&hyphen;yearly or quarterly reports. The reports must be given to the responsible minister within 2 months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each House as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim reports will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as Government Business Enterprises . A body will formally acquire the status of a GBE by regulations made under the proposed act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors will be required to keep the responsible minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible minister and the Finance Minister such documents and information as they may require.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Finance Minister requires such reports, documents and information, it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies must also notify the responsible minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible minister may 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give written guidelines as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may, in writing, exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors of a Government Business Enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a wholly&hyphen;owned company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the responsible minister with financial and other performance information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the government that are capable of being applied to the authority or wholly&hyphen;owned company concerned. The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. I should emphasise that this provision does not confer on responsible ministers, or the government, a general power of direction as to how authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies are to carry out their particular functions. It is only intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in general, such as, for example, policies relating to trade contact with particular foreign countries or for the observance of equal employment opportunity policies etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The government views this as a step in improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies as well as sharpening the accountability of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance in the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now mention briefly some of the provisions of the bill which only apply to Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the Parliament from passing legislation to empower a subsidiary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1355"> to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to maintaining the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act in ways that, as far as practicable, will keep it in harmony with comparable provisions of the Corporations Law, as they exist from time to time. The bill, therefore imposes standards of conduct on officers of Commonwealth authorities that are the same as standards already imposed on officers of companies by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes a penalty regime modelled on the Corporations Law. Accordingly, a number its provisions are identified as `civil penalty provisions' the breach of which may attract civil or criminal sanctions depending on whether the breach is accompanied by a dishonest intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contravention of these provisions may lead to the disqualification of directors from appointments to boards of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term "officer", as it is used in the provisions of the bill relating to Commonwealth authorities, is given the same meaning as it has in the equivalent provisions of the Corporations Law. Consequently, an "officer" is a director or any other person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that a director of a Commonwealth authority who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the Board, must, as soon as possible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the Board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the Board or the responsible minister determines otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, in accordance with another recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements, the bill provides that the responsible Minister shall table in each House particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company. The particulars required are to be prescribed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on government revenues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and accountability framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and Australians generally.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUDIT (TRANSITIONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS) AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor&hyphen;General Act 1996, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic Constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extensive impact of replacing the Audit Act can be seen in Schedule 2 to the bill&mdash;in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the numerous other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act 1901. The proposed amendments will remove all such "Audit Act" references that occur in other legislation and replace them with provisions that appropriately link those acts to the framework of the new financial legislation. Schedule 2 of this bill also specifies consequential amendments to the enabling legislation of Commonwealth Authorities so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also includes amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to create a significantly enhanced role for the committee. These amendments flow from the government's acceptance of the proposition that the role of the Audit Committee of the Parliament be undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee's enabling act will be amended to reflect this new, additional role by expanding its listed statutory duties to strengthen, on behalf of the Parliament, the relationship with the Auditor&hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office. The committee's responsibilities are now proposed to include consideration of the operations and resources of the ANAO and to report on matters arising out of those considerations; to examine the draft estimates of the ANAO and to make recommendations to both Houses of the Parliament and the responsible Minister on those estimates; and, to determine the audit priorities of the Parliament and to advise the Auditor&hyphen;General of those priorities. The Public Accounts Committee Act will also be amended to reflect the committee's role, as provided for in the proposed Auditor&hyphen;General Act, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1356"> approving recommendations to the Governor&hyphen;General for appointments to the Office of Auditor&hyphen;General and that of Independent Auditor&hyphen;General of the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a procedural level across the range of Commonwealth financial administration, the transitional matters provided for in this bill include the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing Fund accounting structure to the new structure established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996; the continuation of the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General in office as at 30 June 1997 for a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of his appointment (in 1995) under the Audit Act; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of Independent Auditor as auditor of the ANAO; the continuation for the time being (until regulations under the replacement legislation come into effective operation) of the current safeguards, as agreed by Parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and, for regulations to be made to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, that might need to demonstrate legal certainty to support their smooth transition to the new legislative framework&mdash;for example, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed Act, such as operating bank accounts, contracts, audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments etc.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1996-97 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second bill containing Veterans' Affairs 1996&hyphen;97 Budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the first bill outlined various budget and other initiatives that were important to the health and well&hyphen;being of veterans and their families, but did not require legislation. Besides the measures outlined in the bill, I want to take this opportunity to refer to another significant initiative funded in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, that will increase the general community appreciation of the sacrifices and the contribution made by the veterans of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to benefits and services provided directly to veterans and their families, the government recognises the importance of developing the community's knowledge and understanding of veterans' war experiences and the contribution of veterans to the development of the Australian identity over the past 100 years. In the current budget, the government committed funding for a four year program of commemorative activities. This program, conducted under the banner of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> "Their Service Our Heritage", will publicly and proudly honour the debt owed by all Australians to our veteran community through a range of programs of commemoration and education, and through the restoration of important memorials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I turn now to the content of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main thrusts of this bill is the rationalisation of payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the government's commitment to administrative reform to streamline the delivery of government services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill allows age pensioners, who also receive a disability pension, to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans, and their eligible partners, it will mean that they need deal with only one Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to stress that this arrangement will not affect eligibility for a service pension. There will be a continuing requirement for a veteran to have qualifying service to be paid a service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangement will simplify payments to, and communication with, veterans who do not have qualifying service and who receive an age pension as well as a disability pension. The popular support for a concept like this was demonstrated in 1995 when most war widows, who also received a social security pension, opted to receive all payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another administrative reform flowing from this bill is the centralisation of payments to carers. From 1 July 1997 the Department of Social Security will have responsibility for all carer payments. Carers who have received Veterans' Affairs payments will be automatically transferred to the Department of Social Security's carer payment. A small number of carers, who could be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by the transfer, will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes in this bill relate to the better targeting of income support benefits. The first of these addresses the relative economies single people can obtain from sharing the cost of rental accommodation. Two people in this situation can now receive more rent assistance than a pensioner couple, even if their combined financial circumstances are the same. This bill will provide for single people, who share rented accommodation, to be paid less rent assistance than they would receive if they did not share, unless they receive their income support for permanent incapacity for work. There are some shared rent situations, such as single people who have dependent children and people in nursing homes, where the pensioner gains 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1357"> no advantage. The new arrangements will not apply in these situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change in this bill relates to the treatment of superannuation for pensioners who are 55 years or older, and who have received income support payments for 39 weeks or more since they reached that age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Veterans with qualifying service can access an age service pension 5 years earlier than others in the community can draw age&hyphen;based income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For male veterans, this means they can obtain an age service pension from 60 years. A lower age applies for female veterans&mdash;now nearly 56 years. The superannuation of people who have reached pension age is currently included in the assessment of their service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the veteran has not reached pension age, a service pension can be paid only if the veteran is permanently incapacitated for work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measure will apply to people who have ceased to participate in the workforce and who have access to superannuation because they cannot work or have reached retirement age. It will mean the superannuation held by pensioners aged 55 or more will be included in the assessment of their income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is reasonable and equitable that their superannuation is used for the purpose intended, and that public funds are not used to support those who choose not to draw on monies that have been set aside for use when they have retired or cannot work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If some pensioners cannot draw on their pension until a later age, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can determine that the new provisions do not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also discontinues the "saved" eligibility for fringe benefits of a group of former service pensioners. These are people who would have lost eligibility for fringe benefits as a result of the introduction of deemed income in 1991. All service pensioners later became eligible for fringe benefits and many of those whose eligibility for fringe benefits had been "saved" a few years earlier could again qualify without the help of the "savings' provisions. The people who will be affected by the changes in this bill are those whose income has been in excess of the pension limits for the past 4 years. There is no justification to continue to allow these people to enjoy the broad range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth and the community for the assistance of those in greater financial need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also provides for the establishment of a Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government undertook to closely monitor the long term care needs of Vietnam veterans. The Scheme that is to be introduced will provide for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> early intervention for younger veterans leaving the Forces and support for Vietnam veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Scheme addresses concerns that have been expressed that some veterans who leave the Defence Forces have difficulty in making the transition to, and remaining in, civilian employment. It also addresses concerns that some incapacitated veterans have about participating in a rehabilitation program unless a "safety net' to protect their pension entitlements was guaranteed by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the Scheme is to assist veterans to find employment and to continue in employment. The development of the legislation for the Scheme has been the subject of extensive consultation with the ex&hyphen;service community. Continuing consultation and ex&hyphen;service community support is critical to the success of the Scheme, details of which are being developed so that it can be tabled before 1 July 1997. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs thanks the veteran community for their assistance in developing this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides the authority for the Scheme and enshrines key income protection for certain veterans who take up employment as a result of a rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme will be available to all eligible veterans, but special provision has been made for those veterans who are receiving a disability pension or a service pension on the grounds that they are prevented by their incapacity from working full&hyphen;time. The bill guarantees that these veterans will not have their pension reduced while participating in a rehabilitation program under the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the veteran begins work as a result of the program, general rate disability pensioners will continue to receive their usual rate of pension. Veterans on above&hyphen;general rate pensions (such as T&amp;PI pensions) will retain part of their higher disability pension. This removes the disincentive for pensioner veterans to participate in the Scheme. If the veteran is a service pensioner, only part of the veteran's earnings from employment will be taken into account in calculating the rate of service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, at any time, the veteran ceases employment he or she will revert to the rate of disability pension payable when the rehabilitation program was initially undertaken. The amount of service pension will be determined using the usual income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a safeguard, the bill contains a provision that ensures the veteran will receive at least the same income, from earnings and disability pension combined, as he or she would have received as a disability pensioner had the veteran not participated in the rehabilitation program and entered employment.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1358">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards and guarantees are essential if veterans are to feel confident that they can only gain by volunteering for rehabilitation back into the workforce in which their incapacity had previously prevented participation. The benefits veterans may obtain from participating in a rehabilitation program go beyond the financial advantages. These programs increase a person's self reliance and ability to cope with life's tasks, provide opportunities for socialisation, and can help improve the quality of the participant's life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding, Madam President, this government remains committed to maintaining existing veterans' entitlements. As this bill demonstrates, benefits and services will continue to be reviewed to maintain their quality, fairness and appropriateness. Also the government is committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of veterans and their families, and one that directs resources to the greatest needs.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before the Senate provides for the establishment of a voucher system for the delivery of government&hyphen;funded hearing services from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, together with the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997, gives effect to the government's 1996 budget decision to reform the delivery of government&hyphen;funded hearing services. Together, these bills are an important step forward in the bringing of commercial practices and competition into the Health and Family Services Portfolio, and shows how serious this government is about the principles of competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this instance the proposed reforms will achieve more efficient and effective ways of delivering government&hyphen;funded hearing services to more than 200,000 existing beneficiaries, and to the almost 50,000 new entrants to the program each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements that will be in place from 1 July 1997, pensioners and veterans will be eligible to participate in a voucher scheme that will allow them to choose to receive hearing services from Australian Hearing Services as the government service provider or from an accredited private sector provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these changes Australian Hearing Services and private sector providers will compete on an equal footing to provide the best services for their customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will receive the same high quality hearing rehabilitation service they have come to expect, one that fully addresses their clinical needs and ensures real hearing outcomes suited to the individual's needs and situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that this happens, a new Office of Hearing Services will be established and have responsibility for the new arrangements. As well as managing the issuing of vouchers and accreditation of service providers the Office will, in cooperation with the hearing services industry, set service standards and qualifications for those dispensing government services. It will also monitor adherence to an obligatory code of professional conduct for participating service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the Office of Hearing Services will monitor the overall operation of the voucher scheme, check any instances of over or under servicing, and receive and resolve any complaints. Its powers will allow it to take appropriate action if satisfactory services are not being provided. The Office will also serve as a source of information and impartial advice for consumers and help them to make their best choices within the scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1359">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high quality of hearing services currently provided to consumers will be maintained under the new system. They will include assessment of any hearing loss and the design of an appropriate hearing rehabilitation program. Where needed, rehabilitation will include the supply and fitting of a hearing device (for example, a hearing aid or listening device) and/or aural rehabilitation training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level and complexity of each rehabilitation program will depend on individuals' needs, as assessed by a properly qualified service provider and agreed by the client. Each program will include ongoing rehabilitation support. To the extent that this might involve a hearing device, support would include information and assistance to ensure the proper use of the device, maintenance and a supply of replacement batteries. The existing annual contribution of $25 for hearing device maintenance and batteries will continue to apply. This is essential to making sure that clients receive the maximum benefit from their rehabilitation program. Th e amount of this contribution has not changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as all this, people will be able if they wish to purchase additional levels of service to go beyond those they receive free of charge from the government. Unlike previous arrangements when people had to choose either the free government service with no extension, or a totally private sector service at your own expense, people with a hearing loss will now be able to build one onto the other. The government is empowering people to take control of their hearing needs by allowing then not only to choose their service provider but also choose from a range of suitable hearing products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the new arrangements the Office of Hearing Services will ensure that participants in the voucher scheme have access to high quality hearing devices. The establishment of Common&hyphen;Use contracts with suppliers of hearing devices will ensure that consumers have access to devices that meet the full range of clinical needs; ensure that these are provided at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer; and ensure that technical and performance standards are maintained. The bill explicitly provides that the only hearing devices that can be provided through the voucher system are those that meet specifications set by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for ministerial guidance of the scheme and full transparency in decision making. All key characteristics of the scheme will be spelled out in determinations which are to be tabled in the Parliament as disallowable instruments. These will include the arrangements for the accreditation of service providers; the rules of conduct that must be followed by every service provider; and rules governing the nature, extent and use of vouchers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits arising from these reforms are not restricted to new entrants to the Hearing Services 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Program. When the existing 200,000 Program beneficiaries return for services&mdash;for example a reassessment of their hearing as it changes&mdash;they will enter the same voucher system and have access to its options and the range and standards of services it will provide. A transition strategy will be put in place by the Office of Hearing Services to ensure that the pensioners and veterans who are already a part of the Program are able to avail themselves of the additional features of the new arrangements in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The voucher system will have benefits beyond those directly experienced by participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of competition between public and commercial service providers and a more competitive environment within the private sector will result in greater economic activity within this industry sector. The same factors are expected to result in longer term savings to the taxpayer through reduction in the direct cost to government of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new voucher arrangements will affect the current operations of Australian Hearing Services, which in the future will not have exclusive rights to provide government funded services but will have to compete for voucher&hyphen;holders. The establishment of the Office of Hearing Services will allow the separation of the purchasing and regulatory functions that formerly had to be provided by Australian Hearing Services and free it to compete on an equal footing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to providing quality services to voucher&hyphen;holders, Australian Hearing Services will focus on services to children and designated groups of people with complex or special needs&mdash;all of whom, for the moment will remain outside of the voucher arrangements described above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services to children can be a very specialised area, and the undoubted expertise of Australian Hearing Services will continue to be provided to this group in the immediate future. Other people who need specialist intervention include those with high hearing rehabilitation needs and people living in rural and remote areas, such as in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The important and well&hyphen;respected work of Australian Hearing Services in areas of research, hearing loss prevention and industry development will continue in parallel with these reforms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, together with the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997, gives effect to matters relating to the government's 1996 budget decision to reform the Hearing Services Program and to provide greater contestability in the provision of government services in the Health and Family Services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These initiatives serve as an example of the government's commitment to wide&hyphen;ranging competition policy reforms and to achieving more efficient and effective ways of delivering government services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the new arrangements, pensioners and eligible veterans will have greater choice over services; true contestability in service provision will be introduced; and purchasing and regulatory functions will be separated from service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will deal with changes to the Australian government Health Service first.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996 budget announced that the Australian Government Health Service would be corporatised. In a competitive environment that is subject to full market pressures the organisation will achieve greater flexibility and efficiency in its operation. This action is an example of the priority being given by the government to ongoing micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government Health Service currently operates as a business unit within the Department of Health and Family Services, providing mainly health assessment services for Commonwealth clients. It has operated off&hyphen;budget on a full cost recovery basis since 1994 and through modest profits has accumulated cash reserves in its own Trust account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the government's reform objective for the Service, it will, on or before 30 June 1997, be established as a government business enterprise in the form of a wholly Commonwealth&hyphen;owned company under corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All staff employed in the Service will be transferred to the employ of the new company under Section 81C of the Public Service Act 1922 and will be covered by a new industrial agreement to be negotiated over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the two purposes of this bill is to provide transitional measures that will facilitate the establishment of the company. These include powers to enable the transfer of the assets, contracts, liabilities and records of the Service to the new company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide the company with sufficient funds to cover its liabilities in respect to accumulated leave entitlements for the staff transferring and working capital, the bill provides for an appropriation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> equivalent to the balance of the Trust account which will then be closed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government Health Service is currently exempt from State and Territory taxes and this arrangement will continue after the establishment of the company. To ensure competitive neutrality between the company and its private sector competitors companies, the company will pay directly to the Commonwealth amounts equivalent to commercial taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next, I will deal with hearing service arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future hearing service arrangements are defined by the provisions of the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 which is being introduced in this same sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That bill looks to establish a hearing services voucher scheme under which eligible people will be able to choose to receive hearing services from Australian Hearing Services as the government service provider or from an accredited private sector provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a part of these arrangements Australian Hearing Services&mdash;the government service provider&mdash;will compete to provide services to voucher&hyphen;holders, on an equal footing with commercial providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the future, service provision and purchasing roles will be the dealt with by different arms of government. The new hearing services voucher arrangements will be the responsibility of a new Office of Hearing Services which will administer all aspects of the voucher scheme, including contract arrangements with accredited private service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the new voucher arrangements and the changes in operations for Australian Hearing Services will be implemented without additional costs to the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effects of competition between service providers&mdash;that is, between Australian Hearing Services and private providers and between private providers&mdash;and between manufacturers of hearing devices are both expected to result in significant improvements in the cost&hyphen;efficiencies of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed provisions contained in Part 2 of Schedule 2 of this bill will amend the Hearing Services Act 1991 to the extent necessary for Australian Hearing Services to make the transition to its role as a competitor for government business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the moment Australian Hearing Services will continue as a statutory authority, but will adopt full commercial practices. It will experience the actual cost of services to voucher holders, including provision for depreciation and taxation. This will provide for fair competition with private providers. At the same time, it will set a commercial pricing regime for the services that government purchases directly; for example, services to children and community service obligations. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1361">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed reforms, the staff of Australian Hearing Services will be employed directly by the authority under arrangements that are equivalent to a private sector enterprise, rather than through the Australian Public Service, allowing more flexibility for it to operate in the market place for government funded services, to adopt competitive service practices and to attract and retain the staff it requires. The transition in employment arrangements will be achieved without disadvantaging current staff, who will retain the right of return provided by the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to providing quality services to voucher&hyphen;holders who choose it, Australian Hearing Services will be the sole government provider of services to children and designated groups of people with complex or special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services to children can be a very specialised area, and the undoubted expertise of Australian Hearing Services will continue to be provided to them. Other people who need this specialist intervention include those with high hearing rehabilitation needs and people living in rural and remote areas, such as in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Authority's important and well&hyphen;respected work in areas of research, hearing loss prevention and industry collaboration will also continue and will not be jeopardised in any way by the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's intention, however, that Australian Hearing Services will move to become a Government Business Enterprise on or before 30 June 1998. The government will consider whether Australian Hearing Services will compete for non&hyphen;eligible consumers in two years. This will be done in the context of reviewing resposibility for services for children and the prospect of privatising the Authority.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends a number of acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It also amends 2 acts within the responsibilities of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature, makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation and repeals a spent provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (AAT Act) will establish a `Small Taxation Claims Tribunal' within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Rather than creating a separate structure, the Taxation Appeals Division of the AAT will be known as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal when it is exercising powers under the new Part IIIAA of the AAT Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will provide a cheaper and more informal means of resolving disputes between the small taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation. There will be an emphasis on mediation as a form of dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the current AAT structure, the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will also be able to draw on the resources and expertise of the Taxation Appeals Division. All of the powers of the AAT and the Taxation Appeals Division will be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1362"> be exercised by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of tax in dispute, which will determine whether an application for review of a taxation objection decision can be heard in accordance with the new Part IIIAA, will be $5,000&mdash;unless a higher amount is set, some time in the future, by the regulations. Applications for review of a taxation objection decision will have to involve less than the determined amount in order to be heard by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. The Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will also be able to hear applications for review of a decision refusing a request for an extension of time. It is intended that the non-refundable filing fee for small claims matters will be $50, but the tribunal will be able to waive this fee in cases of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make a procedural amendment to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 arising from advances in technology. There are now films that provide what is known as `click-on' access to a range of viewing options. This can make classification difficult, as the classifier cannot be sure that all of the viewing options available have been accessed for classification purposes. The amendment will put the onus on the applicant to inform the Classification Board of the presence of any contentious material in the film. Failure to do so will, if this material comes to light after classification, result in the film being automatically de-classified if the material would have led to the film receiving a different classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the act to align, with the amended criterion in the National Classification Code, the criterion for refusal to approve an advertisement under the act on the grounds that it contains child pornography. Commonwealth, State and Territory Censorship Ministers have amended the Code to tighten the child pornography criterion to make it easier to deal with material where it is difficult to determine the age of the person portrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will allow a member of the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to receive remuneration as a member of the Tribunal, in accordance with the act, while concurrently holding judicial office or the office of magistrate, provided that office is remunerated on a part-time basis. The bill will also correct drafting amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make some minor amendments to the Evidence Act 1995. One of the amendments will extend the operation of a certificate given under section 128 of the New South Wales Evidence Act. Such a certificate gives a witness use and derivative use immunity in respect of self-incriminating evidence given in any New South Wales court. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments will correct drafting and minor technical errors in the Evidence Act and its explanatory notes, achieve total consistency in drafting expression between that act and the New South Wales Evidence Act and insert further explanatory notes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make a number of drafting and technical amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, consequential upon the amendments made by the Family Law Reform Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previously existing jurisdiction of magistrates' courts in defended child maintenance matters will be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will clarify the relationship between parenting plans under the Family Law Act and child support agreements under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, making it clear that one document can be used for both purposes. Technical anomalies will also be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, two new matters will be added to the particular matters about which rules of court may be made by the Judges of the Family Court of Australia. The addition of trial management will allow the making of rules of court that will further advance the simplification of procedures and provide greater certainty about procedural aspects of trials. The addition of conciliation conferences to this provision will provide a clear power to make the rules that provide for conciliation conferences. Such conferences are an important aspect of assisting parties, where appropriate, to resolve their disputes without requiring a judicial determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make a number of minor policy amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996, judicial registrars will transfer from the Industrial Relations Court of Australia to the Federal Court. New roles for judicial registrars are planned in relation to native title and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission work. However it may be some time before cases suitable for judicial registrars are referred to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Federal Court Act to enable the Federal Court to delegate to judicial registrars certain additional jurisdiction in any Federal Court matter&mdash;up to a monetary limit of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide for the Court to be able to appoint Marshals, for the purposes of the Admiralty Act 1988, as officers of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, appeals can be brought, to both the Federal Court and the High Court, from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections. The stated intention of the ACT legislature is that there be no appeal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1363"> from the Court of Disputed Elections. The bill will provide that an appeal to the Federal Court or the High Court can not be brought from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act provides that the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Director of Public Prosecutions may bring a reference appeal, on a question of law arising in a trial in the Supreme Court, to the Federal Court. This has been interpreted to mean that only the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions may bring these appeals. The bill will ensure that reference appeals can also be brought by the ACT Attorney&hyphen;General and the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide that reports of reference appeals may, in certain circumstances, be published.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, proceedings in the Federal Court may be referred, with the consent of the parties, to mediation. The Federal Court has suggested that a power to order mediation would assist the Court to clear its backlog of cases by streaming cases into a procedure which promotes settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is often said that mediation is a consensual process, it some cases the initial reluctance of the parties to mediate is not necessarily a good indicator of their capacity to be helped by mediation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow the Federal Court to refer parties to mediation without consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will provide a mechanism for establishing an applicable rate of exchange in relation to the registration of foreign judgments. The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of New Zealand currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain New Zealand judgments. The amendments to the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of foreign currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain foreign judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day on which the rate of exchange is to be established will also be changed. Currently it is the day of the application for registration of the judgment. It will be the second business day before the day on which the application for registration of the judgment is made. This is necessary to enable the judgment creditor time to obtain the necessary evidence from authorised foreign exchange dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judges' Pensions Act 1968 will be amended to provide that a retired federal judge is entitled to receive the federal judicial pension and hold judicial office in relation to a Territory, provided 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the judicial office is not remunerated on a full-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judiciary Act 1903 will be amended to provide the Federal Court with jurisdiction under sections 75 and 76 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently clients of the Australian Government Solicitor, when successful parties to proceedings in all courts, are entitled to recover party/party costs. The Judiciary Act 1903 will also be amended to allow for the recovery of costs in Federal Court proceedings by successful parties represented by State or Territory government lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 will be amended to provide that the act will apply to the Australian Capital Territory on the same basis as it applies to the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Act 1988 will be amended to give the Privacy Commissioner the power to determine that an agency is to be a credit provider for the purposes of the act. This amendment is intended to deal with the situation where an agency provides credit on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will also allow a credit reporting agency to list an overdue payment under a guarantee on the guarantor's credit information file. This will only be permitted where the credit provider has first satisfied several conditions, including notifying the guarantor and allowing him or her a 60 day period to make the payment, as well as taking steps to recover the amount of the payment. For this purpose, the bill also inserts in the act a definition of the term `guarantee' and a transitional provision to ensure that the amendment does not operate retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will clarify the Privacy Commissioner's powers in relation to the copying and retention of documents produced to him or her under section 44 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make some amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. None of the amendments will make any significant policy change. The States and Territories were consulted about all the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two amendments will correct drafting omissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of the amendments will take account of changes in State practices by providing for the use of bail justices in Victoria and by allowing Sheriffs' officers and bailiffs of prescribed States to execute interstate warrants of apprehension for the enforcement of lower court fines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments will</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Superannuation Act 1976 will widen the pool of Administrative Appeals Tribunal members who are eligible to hear applications for review of decisions made under the Superannuation Act 1976.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill forms part of a package of three bills to give effect to the Government's 1996 budget decision regarding retirement savings accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retirement savings accounts&mdash;or RSAs for short&mdash;have a central role to play in the government's strategy for increasing choice and competition in the superannuation sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Choice gives employees greater scope to control the management of their superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased competition will raise the standard of service delivery throughout the industry. It will also facilitate greater product innovation and diversity, and place downward pressure on fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill allows banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation has traditionally been provided through a trust structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the trust structure is less relevant in the case of prudentially supervised institutions&mdash;banks, non&hyphen;bank financial institutions and life insurance companies. The government's RSA reforms will enable these prudentially supervised institutions to provide superannuation directly off their balance sheet. This will facilitate more cost&hyphen;efficient delivery of superannuation, without compromising the security of member benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product. In particular, they will be required to be `capital guaranteed'. This means, in effect, that the account balance and any accumulated earnings or interest cannot be reduced by negative investment returns or downward adjustments to the value of investments underlying the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accounts, into which a member and/or an employer on the member's behalf will be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1365"> make contributions, will be fully portable. They will be owned and controlled by the member, and will be subject to the retirement income standards applying to other superannuation products, including preservation and disclosure rules. Disclosure rules for RSAs will be simplified, however, in recognition of their capital guaranteed nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees will also be able to transfer amounts out of RSAs at any time, although RSA providers may require notice, of not more than 12 months, to minimise liquidity risks and ensure orderly administration arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The low cost, low risk nature of RSAs will be particularly attractive to certain sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs should be especially suited to people with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts, and those nearing retirement who wish to minimise the market risk on their superannuation savings. Fees should be low and the accounts will be subject to the `member protection' rules which apply to superannuation accounts with less than $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs should also be particularly beneficial to women with interrupted working lives, who may need a flexible, low cost and easily accessible product for the receipt of irregular contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSA providers will benefit from being able to offer cost&hyphen;efficient delivery of superannuation and the ability to use more explicitly the institutions' name in marketing superannuation, as well as from enhanced customer relationships through provision of one stop shop services, for example through branch networks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation of RSAs will have two elements: prudential supervision for institutional soundness of the RSA provider; and functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no duplication of prudential supervision, which will be carried out under existing regulatory frameworks, for example by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the case of banks, and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and State Supervisory Authorities in the case of building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Functional supervision of RSAs and RSA providers will be undertaken by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will regulate compliance with retirement income standards. These standards ensure RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes and provide for a well informed membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is closely modelled on relevant provisions in the regulatory regime currently in place for superannuation entities under the Superannuation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This will ensure that the treatment of RSAs in relation to the superannuation standards is as consistent as possible with that applying to existing superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry associations representing prospective RSA providers and the consumer movement were closely consulted on this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be extensive consultation in the development of the Regulations covering disclosure rules for RSAs, member protection, preservation and other matters, to ensure neutrality between RSAs and broadly equivalent products offered by public offer superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the date of effect of the bill will be 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill, together with the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1997 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill 1996, gives effect to the government's 1996 budget initiative to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts, to ensure that the retirement savings accounts&mdash;or RSAs&mdash;are subject to the same rules which currently apply to other superannuation products, such as those offered by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> putting in place a concessional taxation regime for RSAs that is broadly equivalent to the current taxation treatment of other superannuation entities;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for an annual retirement savings accounts supervisory levy to be paid by entities providing RSAs. The levy will recover the costs of supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in monitoring the compliance of RSA providers and RSAs with retirement income and other superannuation standards.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upper limit is distinct from the actual levy, which is set by regulation and can therefore be disallowed by Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing at the moment with amendments 1, 2 and 6. Just before we broke, Senator Harradine was making some remarks. The difficulty with any Independent, as Senator Harradine would know, is that, for the rest of us, it is somewhat difficult to establish what the policy position is, because Independents do not have the resources of parties and do not issue manifestos at election time, and all that sort of thing. Therefore, for me, as a new senator, to glean what Senator Harradine stands for and what his position is on policy issues, I have to listen to him and watch him over time to form a judgment. The other source of information, of course, is the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did refer to Wool International as a precedent in these matters. I took the opportunity in the break between the committee sessions to examine the debates in both chambers in relation to section 23 of the Wool International Act 1993, and that section&mdash;as you recall, I read it out in detail&mdash;was prescriptive as to the qualifications relevant to or experience in the fields required for the board. The Labor Party has confirmed its consistency with its position then by supporting us on this amendment. I wanted to see how the coalition and Senator Harradine behaved at the time of the Wool International Bill, where they are claiming on a matter of principle that the matters I have outlined in amendment 1 should not be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted in regard to the Wool International debate that the only time the Senate divided was over an amendment proposed by Senator Woodley which related to the stockpile release. But the bill as a whole passed the Senate on the voices. There has been a major switch in opinion on this matter, which is surprising because there are numerous examples of statutory boards which require members to possess specified qualifications. These include the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Industry Council, the National Native Title Tribunal and the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find the desire by the government and Senator Harradine to reject my amendment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> No. 1 surprising in view of the precedents of the various acts and their own behaviour. The second point I wish to make about that is that in my speech in the second reading debate I did say that we were quite happy to consider any amendments or improvements that you might seek to throw up to improve that. Alas we got none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make relates, strangely enough,  to a question asked during question time about the appointment to head Landcare. Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate said&mdash;I will paraphrase because I do not have <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in front of me&mdash;`Nominees will not be produced by the bureaucrats; they will be produced by me.' I am a man of considerable experience in the recruitment, selection, induction and placement of people, employees or board members. I know that if you are a busy person and if you are a professional, you cannot afford to take the time to review the total job market yourself if you are going to get the best person for the job. You put it in the hands of a professional, because it is an extremely time-consuming process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that he will ignore his bureaucrats, who will do that job for him. They will be produced by him. That was an admission to me that ministers of this government will personally pick their nominees and will not take the advice of their departments. Since they do not have time to really look across the field of qualifications, they will pick a mate. In other words, it is a question of political patronage, not merit. No minister possibly has the time to pursue appointments and select candidates objectively, so it is done subjectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My question to you, Parliamentary Secretary is: in the selection of these persons for this board, does this minister intend to take the advice of his bureaucrats, as they are described? Does this minister intend to have the field properly, independently and objectively reviewed, with a view to finding a candidate, or is he simply going to pick nominees without regard to his advisers?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a good point you raise, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1368"> Senator Murray, but I think you almost insinuate that because ministers are so busy&mdash;there is no doubt that they are; I find even parliamentary secretaries can be quite busy too&mdash;you do not have time to consider appointments properly and therefore you just pick a mate. I could not say that that has never happened in the history of an Australian government. I am sure it probably has. However, I think even Senator Bob Collins agreed with me wholeheartedly this morning when I described the process that does go on with board appointments. Senator Murray, with his own experience in the area of appointments, professional placements and so forth, would understand that it is quite an important process in both the private sector and the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, and I presume the previous government, from listening to Senator Collins, both took this matter quite seriously if the procedures that are in place that I have witnessed in my own experience are anything to go by. Many of the appointments in this government go to cabinet. The matters are subject to advice from the department&mdash;bureaucratic advice&mdash;and when it comes to appointments where you are looking for particular expertise or experience in a field, you would more often than not take advice from people in industry and other organisations. You make soundings around the place. You may talk to a range of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite certain that the minister responsible for this act will follow that course and will take that sort of advice. As Senator Harradine said quite properly just before 12.45 p.m. today, the minister is accountable for these decisions in this place. I am sure that Senator Collins, Senator Murray, Senator Harradine and other honourable senators will be the first to stand up if the appointments made to this board or any other board appointed by the Commonwealth are made on the basis that the minister is too busy and could not be bothered to go through the advice and just appoint his mate from the local pub. I am sure that would not take place and I am sure that Minister Sharp in particular, who is an exceptionally good minister, would not do that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of the minister responsible; it is a matter of a piece of legislation which we hope will stand the test of time. That is why the government continues to oppose the motion which not only ties the hands of Minister Sharp by setting a check list&mdash;a menu&mdash;of things to choose from when you are selecting a board, but it ties the hands of all ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there are other boards that do have some prescription as to who should be on them, I know that a number of the boards that you mentioned&mdash;for example, the boards of the ILC and the Native Title Tribunal&mdash;do have some prescription in the legislation as to what sort of people should be on those boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine will recall that in relation to the Indigenous Land Corporation board, which is only in my recent memory, there was some prescription. In fact, if you check the record, I may have actually tried to put that in there by way of amendment. It was still very broad and allowed an enormous amount of discretion. It was a broad statement of the sort of qualities that members of that board might have. It did not give them a check list of seven items&mdash;a check list that we assert excludes quite specifically people who could be very competent to serve on this sort of board. The government stands by that position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Don Chipp. I still remember the speech. I was actually interested enough to tune in when he launched the Democrats. He opened his speech by saying that the dreadful thing about Australian politics was that it was too confrontationist, that it was too combative and that the opposition and the government kept on belting each other up. He devoted 10 minutes to that and then devoted 20 minutes to beating everybody up. For that reason, I think sometimes the Democrats' halo slips around their ears just a bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I want to make that point is that I am not suggesting&mdash;and I really am not&mdash;that we on this side of the house are not interested in having some proper scrutiny of these appointments. It would probably be a very useful reference to an appropriate Senate committee to have it examined. But, Senator Murray, it is the point that you in fact made that causes us not to want to vote for it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is appropriate to have the Nolan committee recommendations or anything else incorporated in one single act applying to a single statutory board, as distinct from any other statutory board. It may well be something that a Senate committee can usefully have a look at to find whether we want to follow that Great Britain model of having these things in statute law, but they should apply to all statutory boards and not simply to the board of CASA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell has probably read the complete Nolan committee report, but I suspect most senators in the chamber have not had the opportunity at this point to have a look at that piece of work that was done in Great Britain. I simply wanted to make that point so that our position is not misunderstood on this. It is not that we are rejecting at all the merit of some of the proposals contained in these amendments. Perhaps at some stage we may consider doing something like that to apply to all statutory boards. But when I examine the matter, if my suspicions are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> correct and if the establishment of the independent statutory authority commissioner in Great Britain was also accompanied by a fleet of additional public servants, then the attraction of that is going to pale with me somewhat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the procedures for appointment to the board, I would like to indicate that often when governments take processes to the committee and sometimes when they take processes to the Senate they find that when the community is involved they actually have the ability to collect information that 60 or 90 staff, no matter how many you put on, would not be able to collect. One of the advantages of opening the process up to the community&mdash;and I do not think government should be scared of such processes&mdash;is that for good value you actually have access to the knowledge and information scope of experience that you could never write into any board or into any staffing arrangement that exists within a ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of trying to do everything from within a ministry, sometimes taking things to the community is in fact cost effective and is a means of finding out the hitches before they happen, provided you listen carefully to what the community has to say. If the Senate really is serious about looking at the recommendations that have come out of a report from the UK&mdash;and of course I am never one to immediately jump on the bandwagon just because something has been done in another country, but it does seem reasonable in this case to look at that&mdash;and if the opposition and perhaps the government in the future are prepared to look seriously at how we can do

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of assuming that procedures for appointment to the board which involve the community are going to mean extra staff, extra problems and extra costs, let us assume that it is very good value.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April last year, Salisbury High School, in a struggling area in the northern part of Adelaide, established a $30,000 scheme to tackle the problem of chronic, long-term youth unemployment in their region. They formed a partnership between industry and the school so that they could work together. It is South Australia's first enterprise high school.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5L6">Senator FERRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The industry, Senator Carr, will be revealed to you if you just listen. Salisbury is an area with chronic high unemployment not only among the young people but also, sadly, among their parents. In fact, there is in some cases third generation unemployment. In Salisbury, youth unemployment has reached a very tragic 42 per cent of the local population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expanding information technology industries do offer enormous employment opportunities. Until recently, employers in the region have had to go outside the area to get skilled workers. This has been expensive for the companies and did not help the local unemployed people. So now in Salisbury there is a connection between the school and other training providers in the region and, most importantly, with employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important first step has been the partnership signed between Salisbury High School and AWA Defence Industries, which is now part of British Aerospace&mdash;British Aerospace, Senator Carr. The agreement will increase contact between the school and the industry, linking education to economic development in the area and, most importantly, to jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students now learn in workplaces such as British Aerospace, Motorola and in some small businesses in the region. This innovative program has already introduced significant educational benefit for students, their parents and the teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has helped to encourage more highly motivated and enthusiastic students. It has increased opportunities for future productive employment and training. It has provided greater educational awareness, more flexibility in problem solving skills and research and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most importantly, it has helped teachers stay in touch and update their skills and their knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also great benefits for industry. Mr Graham Smith, a manager from British Aerospace, has commented that the program is `a two&hyphen;way partnership'. He has given the example of his staff receiving computer education at Salisbury High School, so school facilities are being used out of school hours through sensible sharing of resources. Simultaneously, the school is supporting important adult education activities in the region.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a scheme that is meeting employers' expectations as well as providing very valuable learning opportunities for the whole district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Salisbury High School is in one of Adelaide's more disadvantaged areas. It has taken a very enterprising approach to a chronic problem in its area and it is getting results. A brochure from the school expresses quite clearly what is being done to tackle the problem. Its very revealing mission statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of an enterprise culture in the school will act as a catalyst for young people to be in charge of their own destiny and successfully attain the required skills and competencies for work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This approach is consistent with the coalition's policy of providing more diversity and more choice in schools. It is giving families more interest in&mdash;some might say more control over&mdash;their children's education and a greater sense of involvement and, most important of all, the chance to get a job. This approach also goes hand in hand with key initiatives from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), with initiatives such as MAATS, which is designed to improve Australia's training system and create real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say how much I applaud all those people at Salisbury High School who have been involved in the scheme, and British Aerospace, who have also assisted in its establishment. I commend them, as I am sure other senators would, for their enterprise and their vision. In particular, I commend them for the positive contribution that they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1374"> making to help young people take a greater control of their lives. We all know that if people are able to go home at the end of a day feeling as if they have achieved something worth while, something that has made their day a little different from a day spent at home unable to find a job day after day, it helps those young people feel more involved and more positive about their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme at Salisbury High School is helping young people to take charge of their future and to do things for themselves which in turn will create, in the longer term, a competitive and prosperous Australia, which we all aspire to.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1374"><TITLE>Importation of Cooked Chicken Meat

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding cooked chicken meat imports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 31 May 1996, we wrote to you advising that if cooked chicken meat imports were allowed into Australia, there was no way we would continue to remain members of the Liberal Party. In his latest press statement of the 22nd June, Mr Anderson has made it quite clear that he now intends to allow cooked chicken meat imports early this year as soon as cooking procedures have been finalised and it is obvious to us that from now on, even if he should change his decision, it will only be as a result of extreme pressure from the chicken industry and environmental movement. The effect of Mr Anderson's decision is that cooked chicken meat imports will eventually bring with it Newcastle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disease, resulting in disastrous consequences for our native bird life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Anderson and your government have turned down the unanimous all&hyphen;party Senate inquiry findings, the main point of which was area certification&mdash;i.e. that imports should only be allowed from areas certified free of disease, an internationally accepted practice. He has not listened to a majority of parliamentarians, including most of his own party. He has turned down a motion passed at the annual conference of the New South Wales Liberal Party, and his decision is strongly condemned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, the Australian Veterinarians Association, Dr Balkar Bains and Dr Paul Gilchrist, probably the most widely recognised authorities on poultry disease in the world and New South Wales respectively.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some statement was made in estimates and today by Senator Newman in relation to the closure of Medicare offices that, in fact, the effect of these closures would be limited because of the opening up of pharmacies as places where claims can be faxed to the Health Insurance Commission. But, as anyone who is familiar with this proposition would be aware, the pharmacies option is not a reasonable replacement for those Medicare offices because, firstly, rather than providing a personal service and cash immediately, it will only provide the opportunity to fax in your claim form and have it then processed and returned to you in the mail; but, secondly and most tellingly, these pharmacies will only be placed in areas where there is an isolated chemist or a chemist that receives an isolated area subsidy. The fact is that Medicare offices, by their definition, are only placed in areas of higher population. Therefore, there is no coincidence between an area where a pharmacy Medicare processing point would be placed and where a Medicare office may be closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very strong concern in the community about this continued intention of the government to close Medicare offices&mdash;35 by the end of this year or shortly thereafter, as advised by the department&mdash;and their budget forecasts indicate that, unless there is a change of decision, Medicare offices will continue to close and members of the community will not be able to get that personal service and cash over the counter that they are used to.</PARA>

It is also a perfect example of where the government could raise revenue to meet pressing budgetary needs. Conservative estimates show that $85 million could be collected annually by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private licensed registered club industry in Australia is afforded tax-free status on income derived from members. The favourable income tax treatment is through the principle of mutuality. The mutuality principle provides that, where a number of persons contribute to a common fund that is created and managed as a common interest, any excess earnings that are generated from the use of the fund are not, for the purposes of taxation, to be considered income. This is an excellent system. But it is only excellent where it is not abused&mdash;and it is abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, private licensed registered clubs are only assessable for taxation that is earned from trading with non-members. The determination of taxable income of non-members is based on what is known as the Waratah principle. That principle is derived from the Waratah's Rugby Union Football Club v. FCT, 1979, 10 ATR 33&hyphen;79, which is now probably outmoded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that this raises is the matter of the regulation of sign-in procedures in clubs. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1376"> The enforcement of membership amongst its customers by a club is of major concern from a tax point of view. It is in the interests of licensed clubs to be less vigilant in the policing of the numbers of non-members in a club and, therefore, this clearly serves as an incentive to distort the level of income that is declared for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This results in many clubs having an unfair advantage over hotels and other tax paying businesses, including gymnasiums, travel agents, bus operators, hairdressers and butchers. The current situation has a severe effect on the hotel and other associated hospitality and service industries. If left unchecked, it will undoubtedly result in reduced investment in those industries, many of which are small businesses, which will result in being to the detriment of Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loopholes need to be tightened up. Government happily tightens the budget and tax screws on ordinary Australians. But clubs which abuse these loopholes are so far escaping the net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that large clubs do not have to pay income tax on their gaming operations means that other operations of the club can be subsidised, including food and beverages, entertainment and accommodation, along with undertaking further activities and capital expenditure. The major influence of the large clubs appears to be in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The benefits for `members and guests' in accessing cheap subsidised club operations&mdash;including dining and bar facilities, gym and entertainment&mdash;in these areas are to the detriment of taxpayers in the other states and territories and in the entertainment industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence that clubs are using their tax concessions to threaten private enterprise includes the disclosure by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 13 December 1996 that New South Wales clubs have not paid any income tax on more than $138 million derived from the Club Keno electronic lottery game. The club industry apparently faces up to $50 million in back income tax alone on Club Keno.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Documentation shows that 34 clubs have not paid income tax on a combined revenue of $80 million, including $8.9 million and $6.9 million tax-free to the Manly-Warringah and St George rugby league football clubs respectively. Over $1.1 billion is spent annually by New South Wales clubs alone on capital works, plant, refurbishment and new poker machines. That expenditure includes: a proposed $50 million development at the Blacktown Workers Club; a $30 million club hotel at Gosford Leagues Club; and a $100 million development at Canterbury Leagues Club, including a 240-room hotel. Those are very large businesses. They are hardly clubs in the general sense of the word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examples of the limited amounts of tax being paid by clubs include the Panthers Rugby League Club, where the club paid only 1.4 per cent income tax on its 1996 profit of $4,482,459. This is despite the fact that Panthers, which had a 1996 revenue of $83 million, received $596,330 in interest in 1996 and has admitted that up to 60 Taiwanese tourists, who cannot possibly be Panthers members, stayed at the club and played the poker machines each night. These are businesses, not clubs and, like many clubs, these are part of the entertainment industry. Panthers are directing some of their profits into a $22 million 16-screen cinema complex which they announced in October 1996. The cinema will compete with private enterprise cinema complexes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern has also been expressed at the fact that the level of community contributions from clubs is not accurately measured. The role of clubs should be to support community projects in sport or welfare. Many do, and the Australian Democrats strongly support the continuation of that community service. But there are many cases in which it can be shown that clubs are paying nothing or a very small percentage of their profit back to the community. This is an unacceptable distortion and manipulation of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats support the proposal whereby the commercial activities of private licensed registered clubs which are operating as a business should be subject to company tax as any other business enterprise. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1377"> Clubs should also be obliged to pay a mandatory sum to community organisations as part of their charter. Apparent constraints on the Taxation Office and the courts to effectively interpret the current taxation exemption in respect of clubs should be removed by both legislative change and a more vigorous enforcement and evaluation procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One proposal that I am aware of is that section 23(g)(iii) of the taxation laws should give effect to a test that clubs show that the principal activity of that club is in accordance with the original objectives of the club. The effect of this change would be that where clubs have a principal activity relating to social activity, as distinct from sporting or community activities, then there would be definitive guidelines whereby the tax office would be in a position to review those clubs in order to reassess their taxation exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further proposal is that a mandatory donation of, say, four per cent of gross turnover be paid by each club to registered charities and community organisations, provided a certain level of profit or surplus is achieved. A conservative estimate of the possible tax revenue arising from such proposals is $84 million annually and a community benefit of $186 million based on the mandatory donation of four per cent of gross turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats would ask that the government review this situation and believe that this situation must be addressed as a matter of urgency to assist small business competitors that are being unfairly disadvantaged, to provide revenue to assist in reducing the deficit currently facing this government and to contribute to government's budgetary needs.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1377"><TITLE>Shalom Aboriginal Community, Townsville</TITLE>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fuelled by media reporting of comments by particular parliamentarians. So tonight I want to speak about a good news story about an exciting initiative for Aboriginal and Islander people in a community that I had the privilege of inspecting recently in Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Shalom community development is a totally interactive community offering principally indigenous Australians&mdash;and I emphasise principally, because it is not restricted to indigenous Australians&mdash;a complete range of services and infrastructure, including: a coeducational college, both primary and secondary; an elders village and nursing home; a construction and training facility; community housing; and sporting and recreational facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks back, I was taken on a tour of the complex by the head of the Shalom community, Reverend Shayne Blackman. I am sure, following my inspection, that the development I saw is one that well could form a model to help improve the unequal position of Australia's Aboriginal and Islanders right around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project addresses some appalling statistics of Aboriginal and Islander people. Some of those statistics are well known. Fewer than 50 per cent of Aboriginal and Islander children have any preschool experience; 85 per cent of children of compulsory school age participate in primary or secondary education, compared with the national average of 100 per cent; 11 per cent of 15-year-olds have never attended a school; 30 per cent of 16- to 17-year-olds participate in formal training, compared with the national average of some 85 per cent; and, perhaps most damning of all, 33 per cent of working age people are employed compared with the national average of about 66 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Shalom development and Shalom community work to improve these statistics by giving indigenous people the option of choosing an educational and lifestyle option in keeping with their traditional cultures and values, while at the same time providing them with access to the sort of support that all Australians expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total development is an activity of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1378"> Congress, which is the Aboriginal arm of the Uniting Church in Australia. It is managed by a board of directors&mdash;who all happen to be indigenous people&mdash;and Reverend Blackman is the chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The site is located on 31 hectares, approximately 15 kilometres from the centre of Townsville. It is almost in the middle of the rapidly expanding Thuringowa city, which is one of the twin cities that makes up the Townsville geographical area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The college and the community were opened in March 1992. It was actually established on some land purchased through the generosity of a retired shearer and mushroom farmer from Victoria, who provided an initial sum of $860,000 to the church for this project's commencement. It has grown from providing for only two classes to now offering an impressive array of facilities. Federal and state governments provide some support for the community. Again, that support is principally the sort of support that is given to any school or any nursing home or any accommodation for elderly people right around the country. The community operates largely through church and business donations and through self-funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available to me, I want to mention the array of facilities at the college. There is the Shalom Christian College which currently has an enrolment of 300 students from preschool and primary school through to year 11, with facilities for extension to year 12 likely to be ready for the next school year. The schooling system is designed to prepare students for later life and does so within the Shalom philosophy of involving the total community and educational processes. For instance, parents and respected elders from within the community give valuable input as and when it is necessary. This unique approach supports the efforts of teachers and children to learn and improve their future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These educational facilities were complemented by male and female dormitories, which are also located on site. They were opened in January 1994. These allow for boarders from remote areas to live and learn as part of the complete community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community area has a construction and training facility, which is integrated within the college. The community's construction company and training facility is a particularly impressive initiative and allows both students and long-term unemployed to gain genuine on-the-job work experience by building many of the facilities which appear in the community. So they gain not only real employment but real skills and real qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently 39 people from the community involved in the construction company and training program. They are performing competency based training and working towards genuine qualifications through apprenticeships. Once skilled, with real qualifications, these people have the ability to enter the work force with much greater prospects for gaining employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the projects that training and building initiative have already completed include the primary school and high school, the two dormitories, the three community houses, the training centre, the first class athletic oval, the elders village, basketball courts, a kitchen and dining room, and laundry facilities. It represents $12.5 million worth of work over a three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, when I visited the community they were in the throes of constructing more classrooms on the site. Having seen these facilities first-hand, I can assure the Senate that the workmanship is of the very finest quality and is a real credit to the people involved. The construction team starts each project virtually from scratch, working from the initial design of the building right through to its completion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there is an elders village, which reflects the special responsibilities and the place that elders hold within indigenous communities. The Shalom community also provides this elders village for aged people to live in during their later years of life. That includes a nursing home. It provides for 24 beds for elderly people and allows the community to take advantage of the wisdom and life experiences of the elders. The elders are made to feel very welcome. They are very valued members of the Shalom community, and they are involved in many aspects of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1379"> community life. Their leadership gives direction to the youth and is one of the development's key support mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all its impressive achievements to date, the Shalom community is still growing and evolving. By the year 2000, it is anticipated that there will be over 1,000 people living, studying and working at Shalom each day&mdash;the majority of whom will be Aboriginal and islander people. Its facilities at that time will be complemented with on-site housing, an indigenous art gallery, staff accommodation, a function and conference room, a convenience store and more recreational facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was terribly impressed with this facility which is right in the heart of the fastest growing area of the Townsville-Thuringowa community. It is a real credit to the people involved. It provides a very strong rejection of the negative stereotypes of indigenous communities that have been aired recently&mdash;and they are fairly uninformed and uneducated comments&mdash;by some of those amongst us. I believe this development could be a real role model for pioneering improvements for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that some of my parliamentary colleagues, including Senator Woodley, have visited this establishment. For those who have not, I would urge them to visit if they are in Townsville and have half an hour to spend&mdash;although it really takes more than half an hour. They would then be able to appreciate that very fine development. I am so impressed with the whole development that I do think it forms a magnificent model&mdash;one that we could well use in other parts of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1379"><TITLE>Government Policies: Effect on Small Business</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was announced this week by the Electoral Commission that the ACT stands to lose one of its seats in the other place. This calculation is based on a comparative population growth estimate. I have to say that I am not surprised that the outcome of this redistribution is the loss of one seat to the ACT. Of recent times, the state of the ACT economy has been reported on numerous occasions. At this point in time, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> despite the grandest efforts of many local businesses and of many individuals in the ACT, it is very hard for many of those businesses to survive or to contemplate future growth in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach of this Liberal government towards small business to date has been one of talking up the situation, claiming that they are the representatives of small business in this country, that they have the policies that will see small business&mdash;the growth engines of the future&mdash;provide the jobs this country needs. On behalf of small business in this particular region, it seems that there is no depth and no substance to these words at all. In fact, in the ACT it is small business that is feeling the sharp edge of the government's cuts to the public sector. I am of the view that this government has not truly analysed the relationship that exists between the public sector, government departments and small businesses that actually provide services to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation does not just apply in Canberra or in the region with all the small businesses that feed into Canberra; it applies in every regional centre where there has been significant Commonwealth presence. There is a direct relationship between small business and the public sector. Because of our situation and our industry spread here in Canberra, we are feeling it perhaps more sharply than other places but the principle remains. How can this government say that they are pursuing the interests of those people, when you only need to walk outside of this place to see what is occurring?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of outsourcing is one example of how small business can be affected. But in this case it is not so much a distinction of the impact public sector cuts are having but one of outsourcing policies. The government will be required to consider in the lead-up to the forthcoming budget how it is going to deal with the outsourcing of information technology in government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage there is no strong indication that small business is even going to get a look into these contracts. The nature and structure of the expressions of interest being called indicate that there is no room for our local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1380"> indigenous information technology industry to even have a hope of being competitive in that process. This presents a double whammy for this particular region, which I define very broadly as being the south-east corner of New South Wales. It impacts greatly because it is one of the few strengths we have in terms of future growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That strength in that sector of our industry is something that has been developed, has been nurtured and has grown by virtue of the presence of the Commonwealth government departments here. So not only is this industry being impacted upon in the first instance by the cuts and the reductions in expenditure, but they are being hit again by being excluded from participating in the process in the hope of picking up some of that work that will be effectively outsourced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say this to the government: if you genuinely represent small business then you need to genuinely represent all of small business. You cannot claim to be their representative on the one hand and then, on the other hand, through your policies, seemingly do everything within your power to ensure that they do not have a future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1380"><TITLE>Australian Workers Union</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening in response to comments that were made today by Senator Abetz in respect of long service leave pay-outs in the Australian Workers Union in Queensland. What Senator Abetz said in his brief speech here today was completely off the top of the world, completely wrong and completely unfair to Mr Ludwig and others in the AWU in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at what our friend Senator Abetz said, he started out talking about long service leave, then he got stuck into the superannuation pay-out. He then mentioned superannuation on five separate occasions when in fact the issue was not superannuation but long service leave. But the fact was that the long service leave which was availed by Mr Ludwig and others was well within the limits of the rules of that organisation and well within the law. If Senator Abetz was aware of all the facts on this issue, he would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know and would have informed the parliament that the scheme he referred to in his attack on Bill Ludwig and others is quite legitimate and not in breach of any state or federal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As confirmed by the Queensland Minister for Industrial Relations recently, elected union officials are not employees and therefore not covered by the safety net provided for in industrial relations laws. As a consequence of this, most unions establish provisions in their rules, via legitimate resolutions of their respective executives, which give their elected officials access to respite for continuous long service to the union and its members. In the AWU, after 20 years of continuous service to members elected officials are given the option to access a lump sum rather than take leave. This provision has existed legitimately since the 1950s. It is not something that has happened recently within the AWU; it has been there for almost half a century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure whether Senator Abetz takes four weeks annual leave in his six&hyphen;year elected term, but I have it on good authority that Mr Ludwig and others, who are elected for four&hyphen;year terms take very little leave at all. I have had that experience myself as a trade union official. Leave is few and far between for the officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Mr Ludwig takes his job of representing the interests of 60,000 plus Queenslanders far more seriously than Senator Abetz takes his job. Indeed, if Senator Abetz was doing a good job representing Tasmanian electors he would not be doing the dirty work for factions in an interunion power struggle. Given the spurious nature of these allegations, Senator Abetz must be asked why he is involving himself in an interunion smear campaign. In the interests of fairness, he should reveal who sold him this smear line on Mr Ludwig and the AWU.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="8.00 p.m." PAGE="1380"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 8.00 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) When the Illawarra Main Road to Hagley section of the Bass Highway realignment was built in 1992, predicted traffic volumes were insufficient to justify the construction of a full diamond interchange at the junction of the Bass Highway and Oaks Road. Instead a half&hyphen;diamond with east facing ramps was considered appropriate until traffic demand rose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) $780,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) East bound Bass Highway traffic wishing to access Oaks Road, and  traffic from Oaks Road wishing to travel west on the Bass Highway increased beyond initial estimates which indicated a very low demand. This was compounded by the faster than estimated growth of the newly established annual 3 day AGFEST show held on Oaks Road just south of the junction with the Bass Highway, causing a demand for access to and from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the west earlier than anticipated. In addition unsafe traffic behaviour had begun to develop from drivers (including drivers of commercial and agricultural vehicles) using the east facing ramps to execute `U&hyphen;turns' on the Bass Highway in the face of high speed traffic in order to travel west or to gain access to Oaks Road. The erection of traffic signage to control the traffic failed to eliminate this practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The 1.3 km connector linking the Deloraine Bypass to the Bass Highway from Bonneys Creek to the Deloraine roundabout east of the town was constructed in 1989 with the knowledge that it would be made redundant when the Deloraine Bypass linked up to the new alignment of the Bass Highway to the north of Exton. Initially this was envisaged to be between 7 to 10 years distant. However the decision in 1990 by the then Federal Minister for Transport to accelerate construction between Launceston and Deloraine, meant that the temporary connector only lasted 6 years until September 1995 when it was `dismantled' in preparation for linking the Bypass to the new alignment between Deloraine and Violet Banks which was completed and opened to traffic in August 1996. It was always envisaged that the connector would be a temporary structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As the cost of the connector is subsumed in the original Bypass cost of $19 million, its cost cannot be separately identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The cost of `dismantling' of the temporary connector is subsumed in the overall cost of the $21 million work linking Deloraine to Violet Banks west of Westbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) As for (c). However as the material `sacrificed' by the demolition of the connector was used in the new structure linking the Deloraine Bypass to the new route north of Exton, there was an estimated saving of some $500,000 in the total construction cost in not having to find and transport a quarter of a million cubic metres of material to provide a base for the new flood free road above the Meander River flood plain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The gravel materials used by the contractor in the road base of the original work met set specifications and tested satisfactorily in laboratory conditions. However performance in situ was less than the desired optimum resulting in pavement surface failures at the site mentioned.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="1383" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Federal Government is committed to providing generous compensation and assistance to Australia's veteran community, and to continually improving services to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996/97 Budget provided a guaranteed level of running cost funding over a three-year period. The funding provided allows my Department to meet program and service objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is expected that staff numbers will be reduced further in the near future my Department has an excellent record in adapting to change while maintaining high standards of service to the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Core business should be seen as those activities through which an organisation can add particular value to its overall objectives. The focus of my Department will increasingly be on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) providing an integrated, timely and quality service in the determination of compensation payments and income support pensions; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1384">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) purchasing and monitoring health care services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">c) cost effective facilitation of health and community services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">d) the provision of information on entitlements available to veterans and their widow(er)s;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">e) providing convenient and easy access to information and services through the Veterans' Affairs Network and outreach activities; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">f) commemorating those Australian men and women who served in war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, core business is not an absolute concept, but one which will evolve over time as a result of operational experience and directional changes in Government policy. Core business should not imply a lesser value on non&hyphen;core activities in the effective delivery of services. Rather it should relate to the primary activities of my Department and its staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) My Department successfully outsourced its mainframe computing facilities in 1992 to Ferntree Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the Repatriation Commission has sold or integrated a number of its hospitals. The following Repatriation General Hospitals (RGHs) have been integrated into the State hospital systems:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">RGH Hobart&mdash;1 July 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">RGH Concord&mdash;1 July 1993</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">RGH Daw Park&mdash;9 March 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following hospitals were sold to private operators:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">RGH Greenslopes&mdash;6 January 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres (RALACs) and sub-centres have been transferred to the States:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra sub centre&mdash;1 July 1993</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hobart RALAC&mdash;1 November 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The provision of information technology infrastructure services is currently planned to be outsourced to ISSC Australia Pty Ltd with a contract commencement date of 28 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Savings from outsourcing mainframe services provided by Ferntree returned savings of $10 million over the five&hyphen;year period of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale or integration of the hospitals is expected to deliver savings to the Budget of around $1 billion over 10 years. Services to veterans and eligible dependants will be maintained. In addition, the integration or sale of the hospitals has provided them with a continuing role beyond the date that veterans demand for hospital services will begin to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfers of the RALACs have been cost neutral to the budget and it involves the transfer to the States of the administration of the Free Limbs Schemes. The Repatriation Commission remains responsible for the provision of artificial limbs to veterans and will contract public and private providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Running cost savings from outsourcing all information technology infrastructure services are expected to be in the order of $20 million over the five-year period of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) Yes. Fifty-seven applications have been received from ex&hyphen;service organisations for funding under the Claims Assistance Grants Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) There are no fixed state funding allocations, but decisions on funding will take into account the approximate distribution of workloads at the Veterans' Review Board and the Repatriation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I have approved grants under the scheme, totalling $433,855 this financial year and committing to $743,855 over three years, to the following organisations:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) When part or all of a superannuation or rollover investment is withdrawn before Age Pension age (and the withdrawn amount is not rolled over into another superannuation or rollover fund or deferred annuity), then the growth component of the withdrawal attributable to a period during which the customer was in receipt of a pension or allowance is treated as income for 12 months from the date of withdrawal for income test purposes. Withdrawals, for the purposes of this assessment, do not include commutations of a superannuation pension (or other income stream) to a lump sum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the superannuation or rollover investment is exempt from the means tests while it is held in a fund. This means that the assessment of income on withdrawals from the investment is necessary so that growth received by the customer is taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the amount withdrawn before Age Pension age is rolled over into another superannuation or rollover fund or deferred annuity no income is assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the amount withdrawn will be taken into account under the assets test will depend on what the person does with it. For example, if it is used to pay off the mortgage on the principal home, there would be no impact under the assets test, as the person's home is not an assessable asset. However, if the person used the money to purchase 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a financial investment, the value of the new investment would be taken into account under the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Whether a withdrawal from a superannuation fund affects a customer's entitlements under the current rules will depend on the amount withdrawn, the period the person has been getting income support payments from DSS (the `assessable period'), and the level of growth of the superannuation investment over the assessable period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples in Attachment A illustrate this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) From 20 September 1997, the assessment of withdrawals from a superannuation fund for income testing purposes will depend on whether or not the pre&hyphen;Age Pension age customer has been on income support for a total period of 39 weeks after reaching the age of 55. If the answer is no, then the current assessment rules as indicated in (1) and (2) would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the answer is yes, the growth component of the amount withdrawn would not be assessed as income. This is because deemed income would be assessed on the investment in the superannuation fund while it was held in the fund, based on the value of the investment. There would be an element of double counting if income was also to be assessed when there was a withdrawal from the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In itself, the withdrawal would reduce the amount of deemed income assessed for the customer, because it would reduce the total value of the customer's financial investments to which the deeming rates are applied. In itself, the withdrawal would also reduce the customer's assessable assets. This could result in an increase in entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the customer reinvests some or all of the amount that is withdrawn, then the new investment will be assessed under the means test rules that apply to it. For example, if the customer reinvests the amount that is withdrawn in another financial investment, the net effect would be that the customer's income and asset assessment would remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) As outlined in (3), from 20 September 1997, whether a withdrawal made by a customer whose superannuation assets are assessable affects the customer's entitlement will depend on the use to which the customer puts the funds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth is not involved in any of the proposed river regulation schemes mentioned in the question except for the Walla Weir at Johnstons Crossing on the Burnett River. The Walla Weir Irrigation Project is funded under the Queensland Sugar Industry Infrastructure Program, which is a four year (ending June 1997) program for infrastructure development (transport, irrigation, drainage) in the sugar industry. Commonwealth funding of $4.745 million for the Walla Weir project has been approved conditional on the implementation of environmental and land management conditions recommended by the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon. Robert Hill. No funds have been provided to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Federal Government has not pledged $1 billion for river regulation schemes in Queensland. I understand that the Queensland Government announced in August 1996 its intention to outlay $1 billion over fifteen years on the development of new water infrastructure. Criteria for the selection of projects are a matter for the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The water resource management issues raised in the question are the responsibility of the State and Territory governments and are covered by the strategic water industry reform policy agreed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 1994. The strategic framework includes; pricing reform based on full economic cost recovery; reduction or elimination of cross&hyphen;subsidies; clarification of property rights and enhanced trading arrangements for water entitlements; recognition that the environment is a legitimate user of water; implementation of the National Water Quality Management Strategy; institutional reform and public consultation and participation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation has two research programs of relevance. Under the Management of Nutrients and Eutrophication Research Program work is being undertaken to gain a better understanding of the processes that lead to the development of algal blooms in Australian fresh and estuarine waters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3b) In 1996, under the National Water Quality Management Strategy, the National Medical Health and Research Council and the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand jointly prepared Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. The guidelines provide the minimum requirements for drinking water of good quality. In addition, in 1992 the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council released Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters. These guidelines establish water quality parameters for a range of uses including agricultural and recreational use.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) An environmental assessment process for the Walla Weir project was conducted over a long period of time to ensure that all parties had every opportunity to provide comments on any contentious issues. All comments received were taken into account during the preparation of reports by the Queensland Department of the Environment (QDE) and Environment Australia. The QDE report concluded that the project could proceed subject to a number of conditions being applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reports, along with an independent report on major issues by Dr Keith Boardman, were then considered by the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agreed with Senator Hill's recommendations and therefore approved the release of Commonwealth funds for the project subject to the requirement that the conditions be included as environment and land management requirements in the Implementation Arrangement (IA) for the project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) AGAL's Adelaide laboratory is currently being downsized from 45 permanent and contract staff, to a shopfront with four permanent laboratory staff and two contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The downsizing of the Adelaide laboratory is a part of the overall restructuring and re&hyphen;engineering of AGAL. Similar changes are also being made in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1392"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Following the restructuring, AGAL will continue to provide its full range of analytical services, including important functions relating to food and environmental testing. In particular, AGAL will maintain a strong national capability to respond to food contamination crises, as a backup and extension to the state systems, through major laboratories in Melbourne and Sydney. Funding for AGAL's public interest activities has been maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the services provided in Adelaide are being continued&mdash;most being transferred to AGAL's other laboratories. Staff in the Adelaide shopfront will maintain contact with clients and forward locally sourced work to the appropriate AGAL laboratory. Occupational health and safety services, which cannot be readily transferred, will continue to be delivered by the remaining Adelaide staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Claims that the restructuring of AGAL threatens public health are simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial investigations of incidents such as food poisoning are the responsibility of state public health laboratories. For example, AGAL was not involved in the initial investigation of the Garibaldi incident&mdash;this was handled by the South Australian Government's Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). AGAL nationally has since been involved in investigative work to assist the development of standards and protocols to prevent a repeat of such an incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SA Government's IMVS is in fact the Australian reference laboratory for Salmonella and E&hyphen;coli bacteria&mdash;the causes of recent major food poisoning outbreaks. Suspected food poisoning cases anywhere in Australia are referred to the IMVS laboratory in Adelaide for confirmation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGAL has never provided all services from all laboratories&mdash;it is neither practical nor necessary. The Adelaide laboratory has never had a major capability for environmental testing of soil and water samples, and similarly, the Perth and Brisbane laboratories have never had a comprehensive food testing capability.
