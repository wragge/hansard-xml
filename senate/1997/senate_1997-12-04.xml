<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, these Senate amendments give the capacity to the Federal Court to send matters to the National Native Title Tribunal, as opposed to a state one, where the court deems it appropriate. We had the debate last night pretty extensively. We were about to take a vote when Senator Minchin called time out. It was two minutes early, but there were reasons for that. I think we can put this one to a vote.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to say something to the chamber in respect of this whole issue of equivalent state or territory bodies, particularly in respect of Senator Harradine's amendment which the committee accepted earlier regarding the membership of an equivalent state or territory body. That amendment substituted paragraph 207B(4)(f) so that the Commonwealth minister would have to be satisfied that the relevant state or territory legislation would require a member of the NNTT to be a member of the equivalent state or territory body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine said last night in the debate that he does think it important that the NNTT member have a proper role within the state or territory tribunal. Certainly, from the government's point of view, we would expect that the experience of NNTT members ap 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pointed to a state tribunal would be fully utilised by the state or territory in question. But obviously, if that were to mean that the national tribunal member had to be involved in every mediation or exercise of the power to register claims under the determined regime operating in the state, the process would not be workable, although I do not think that is exactly what Senator Harradine intended to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does accept that it is important that the role of the member of the NNTT in the state or territory equivalent body be clarified and will for that purpose be making a statement on that role after there has been an opportunity to talk to the states and territories who wish to establish equivalent bodies about the implications of the amendment moved by Senator Harradine and how those intentions might be best reflected in operational arrangements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that the Senate will not be terribly surprised at the time, I wish to flag that there are some further amendments in relation to the role of judiciary in the states and territories and how that role can be made equivalent so that everybody knows where they are. These are being drafted now. I just wanted to flag that at some later stage we will be seeking to come back to this small area we are dealing with now so that we can look at my subsequent amendments. They have not been circulated yet, but I would like to go back to that at some stage.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for his comments. It is an important amendment that has been incorporated into the legislation by the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say that a statement from the minister for us is absolutely no satisfactory alternative to what is necessary in practice. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10336"> Statements are often made by ministers and from my experience as a minister&mdash;and Senator Harradine knows this very well&mdash;I can say that you can very easily skirt around issues and assure people in this place, but at the end of day in practice what you are concerned about when you raise the issue is not really satisfied. Senator Harradine should know better than most that, if he is going to rely on a statement from the minister some time in the future, then that is really like saying the cheque is in the mail and you do not really know what the amount is going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no substitute for giving the Federal Court a capacity, in a practical ongoing way, to ensure that this system does not go off the rails. By doing this we can foresee in a couple of years time that the National Native Title Tribunal will be rendered a shell. The states will go on their merry way, having the local equivalent of a fishing warden handling these sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not just land management issues; they are national issues relating to the issue of race. It is pretty important. Spirituality in native title is important and we really should have an ongoing capacity for the Federal Court to act as a bit of a monitor on the system. Unfortunately, Senator Harradine, I am not satisfied, and nor should you be,  with a commitment from the government to say, `The government has produced this legislation to satisfy concerns in the future.' Your amendment goes some way, but I am sure you recognise by your participation in this part of the proceedings that your amendment, as good as it is, does not really cover the field in terms of our concerns. I encourage you to adopt what is a pretty reasonable proposal by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.40 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Items 31 to 33 are what the Greens (WA) call the platypus amendment. Only certain people who were involved in the debate in 1993 know what this means. Section 211 of the current act provides a guarantee that certain native title rights such as hunting and gathering can continue where a law restricting or prohibiting an activity allows that class of activity to be carried out under licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 31 represents a substantial watering down of this guarantee. As long as there is permission to carry out the class of activities to non&hyphen;Aboriginal people, then Aboriginal people should be able to carry out the class of activity. It is not unreasonable that Aboriginal people should be entitled to exercise traditional rights in all circumstances where there is not a complete prohibition on carrying out a traditional activity. If emergency situations were what the government had in mind&mdash;for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10337"> instance, public safety&mdash;then the government should say so. A great deal of scientific research is carried out for private commercial purposes. In those circumstances, indigenous people should be entitled to exercise rights which are fundamental to their own existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 32 is a note stating that the exercise of native title rights is subject to laws of general application. This note is unnecessary and has the potential to create confusion as to which laws apply and the extent to which section 211 rights may be exercised or abrogated by state regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to item 33, section 212 ensures that any confirmation is not a backdoor way to further impair native title rights. The current act requires that such confirmation does not extinguish or impair any native title rights or interests. This is a fundamental protection for native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement on page 332 of the explanatory memorandum that the amendment is justified because ownership or exercise may technically impair the enjoyment of native title in some respects misses the point of the provision and the protection it is supposed to provide. It is not technical; it is a substantive authorisation for the states to impair native title rights without any procedural rights being afforded. It is discriminatory in that no other person's rights are abrogated in this way. I urge the committee to support the removal of items 31, 32 and 33.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will put on the record the government's position on these matters. It is true that under section 211 of the current act native title holders are able to exercise certain native title rights which are stated as hunting, fishing, gathering or those involving cultural or spiritual activities without needing to obtain a licence or permit. That is preserved prima facie, but we have put in item 31 to make it clear that that special exemption to native title holders does not apply where the law under which the licence or permit is granted only allows the activity covered by the permit to be carried out for the purposes of research, environmental protection, public health or public safety. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Therefore, like everybody else, in those circumstances, native title holders would need the requisite licence or permit. We think that is an important matter of public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The note inserted by item 32 simply makes it clear that where native title holders do exercise their native title rights under section 211, they have got to do so in accordance with generally applicable laws regulating that activity, which means things like being subject to the normal criminal laws of the state. We think that is essential to ensure certainty about what laws apply to what people and to make clear something which I would have thought was important from a coexistence point of view and a reconciliation point of view&mdash;that native title holders, like every other member of the community, are subject to the general laws of the community, for example, the criminal law. So it does not interfere with the essential right to engage in native title activities with those two caveats which we think, from a public policy point of view, are important.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.45 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Greens (WA) in opposing items 31 to 33 of schedule 1. We do so for a couple of reasons. We recognise the importance of the area we are talking about. The minister just a few days ago gave an assurance that section 211 would be saved and protected, but this is a substantial watering down. There are two things I need to say about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it is an unjustifiable watering down. There is no reason why we should be removing the protection that is listed in section 211&mdash;no reason at all. The minister still says that that is what that clause should be about, but he refuses to ensure that it is reflected in the legislation. Once again, the court would rather have it in the legislation than by way of any comment by the minister in the committee stage, though those comments will probably be used in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Senator Minchin, we have not been going at a bad pace on this legislation this week and a degree of flexibility on your part on some of these issues may help us to complete the bill sooner than later. Quibbling about things like this is really something that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10338"> is not essential to your 10-point plan. You cannot hide behind that cover. This is an important protection and the opposition agrees with the Greens and the Democrats that these particular provisions of yours should be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to point out to the minister that research these days has a fairly broad application. It can, in fact, be research for commercial purposes. We know what the Japanese mean by research for whaling. We also know that in Western Australia there is commercial exploitation of things like smoke bush. Basically, the Department of Conservation and Land Management is selling off native plants for their genetic lines for commercial exploitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the reality is that it is a far too broad application. Under the broad heading of research we may end up having research for commercial exploitation, research for mining and all sort of research being okay and, as the minister suggested, indigenous Australians being held on criminal charges for undertaking their traditional activities.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the Greens (WA) in opposing items 31 to 33 of schedule 1. I would like to underline what Senator Margetts has just said, particularly in relation to research, because it is a very broad term, and certainly in terms of the inquiry that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has been conducting for the past 12 months in terms of exploitation of native wildlife.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have lost so much of our native wildlife to overseas. An example is the wild flower. The world market for the wild flower industry is now concentrated in Israel. They grow Australian wild flowers and sell them into the international market. The cautionary principle that Senator Margetts is enunciating ought to be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more a case of the confusion as to what the legal regime is, who is allowed to do what and what laws apply in the circumstances generated by section 211. Generally speaking, in Australia we are all as Australians subject to the general law. These items seek to make clear that you cannot breach the criminal law. No-one can breach the criminal law with immunity. So this is simply to make that proposition clear, because it is unclear at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is in the vein of seeking to achieve some certainty as to the application of the general law under the operation of section 211. In relation to the operation of section 211, where native title rights can be exercised without needing to obtain a licence or permit, that does not extend to the situation where licences or permits can be obtained only for the specified purposes set out in item 31. So they really are to deal with what is clear after four years of operation of the act as to the uncertainty of the operation of the law in the circumstances that are generated under section 211.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the more contentious issues in relation to this legislation. The opposition believes that because of the way that the government has tackled it there are issues of equity, constitutionality and discrimination that the Senate will have to address and for which the Senate will be remembered by history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us spell out the problem here. Numerous potentially invalid grants of interest in land have been made between the commencement of the Native Title Act on 1 January 1994 and the Wik decision by the High Court on 23 December 1996. These grants are potentially valid because they fail to comply with the processes under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This happened for a number of reasons. There was a belief held in good faith by some that native title was extinguished by historic pastoral leases. We all know that a misreading of the law is no real excuse at law. Everyone is presumed to know the law, especially the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason this happened was that some states refused to recognise the authority of the Native Title Act. Western Australia was one, but I have to say in respect of Western Australia that once the Waanyi case was determined they then decided to comply with the processes under the act. You cannot say the same about other states. Other states were totally irresponsible in respect of their obligations under the law. These two reasons essentially underpin the third. Some people just took a risk that pastoral leases extinguish native title. Some took that risk in the belief that no native title was claimable over particular pieces of land even when vacant crown land was involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be a recognition by this parliament that, despite some of the reasons for this intermediate period problem, we have to tackle the problem now. There are a number of ways of tackling that. There is the avenue by agreement, which is always the most preferred way to go. There is the avenue available for us to ensure that the processes of the act are now complied with as they can be under the section 29 provision on a one by one basis. I think it has been accepted by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10341"> opposition and the government that there needs to be a more wholesale appraisal of this particular problem and see if there can be a process adopted which would provide what could be called an up-front validation of the problems involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say in that context, that, although the opposition and government have considered those approaches, the alternatives put up by the respective sides are massively different. Can I say in embarking upon this debate that one has to be concerned about the native title holders. They are the people who, time and time again, are having their rights eroded. There is a huge capacity in this legislation to erode them in respect of this particular validation regime being proposed by the government. It is important to focus on them. Historically, they fought for 200 years to assert that Australia was not terra nullius. Since the Mabo case they seem to be fighting to retain what they achieved in that case and in subsequent cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to factor in that some people in the intermediate period obtained rights and did so in good faith misled by the governments, misled by the range of factors and those people also have to be considered in this particular process. The government has an all embracing, broad, far&hyphen;reaching solution which validates all intermediate period acts which occurred over freehold or leasehold land, other than mining lease land but including pastoral lease land, and land on which a public work was constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems for us with the government's proposal is that it goes well beyond the decision in Wik. That is problem No. 1. It applies to land covered by any lease, other than a mining lease, and not just pastoral leases. It applies to land on which public works were constructed or established. Public works include roads, stock routes, wells, bores or any major earth works. This means that titles granted over land could be validated just because there was at some stage in history an old well or an old stock route on that land. It goes too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third problem with the government's proposal is that by going too far not only indigenous Australians will suffer an erosion 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of rights but also taxpayers will have to pay for gratuitous extinguishment. At the same time as that, under the government's proposal we are going to be rewarding states that have deliberately set out to breach the Native Title Act. What we will also be doing is extinguishing when the common law has left that issue substantially open. The common law has laid a number of inferences that would indicate that suppression rather than extinguishment is what is to happen in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of further problems, it goes too far. If we look at the government's category A of scheduled interests, we find that the schedule itself is a huge problem. It is not a schedule of actual leases. It is a schedule of empowering legislation, categories of leases. So there is no certainty that what we would be adopting, if we were to adopt the schedule, would be instruments, leases or whatever that, in practical effect, have been exclusive possession aspects to them. The schedule includes things such as golf links, rifle ranges, defence, water tanks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other pernicious part of this proposal is that the schedule can be added to by way of regulation and there is absolutely no assertion by the government that there is any boundary in terms of what can be scheduled by regulation. The government has made it clear that they do not think a boundary around what the regulations should include is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we in this parliament were to adopt this particular proposal, we would be saying to the government that we accept their schedule now even though it does go too far. Evidence before the committee has showed that. At the same time, if they missed something out in accommodating the shopping list from all the states&mdash;and that is what the schedule is; it is a shopping list from all the states which was put up and was, in some respects, vetted by federal authorities&mdash;they can come back, and it does not matter whether it comes under the broader definitions that are provided by the section, and we will ensure that we can regulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes too far. Not only does it go further than the common law but also it goes further than what was justified by the Wik decision. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10342"> Also, we go beyond past acts which were validated by the original Native Title Act. What we are doing here is validating acts which were carried out unlawfully in the intermediate period and which could not be validated under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is the right to negotiate. The effect of the validation provisions is that native title holders have lost their right to non-discriminatory treatment and the right to negotiate where this applies during the intermediate period. As to constitutionality, let us place on the record that the notification provisions here are nowhere near substantial enough to satisfy requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is saying, `Let's look at a way of providing certainty, but let's look at a fair way of doing it.' Obviously the minor parties do not agree with us, but we believe our alternative is a constructive way to go. We propose a validation regime limited to those acts on pastoral leases, or which were subject to a pastoral lease, not on land which just happened to be covered by other leases some time in the past and not on public work land. If the act in the intermediate period is a pastoral activity, it is validated, and this follows the form defining pastoral activities. If it is not a pastoral activity, then the means by which validation is allowed is by gazettal. The government wanting to validate the act must publish a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and must give notice to the relevant rep bodies within four months of the commencement of the section, and the notice has to include sufficiently detailed information about the act or the grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title claimant groups or representative bodies can apply to the Federal Court on two limited grounds: the act was not genuinely an intermediate period act as defined; or proper procedures were not followed. That protection needs to be there. We propose the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle and compensation being payable. Also, to meet the form requirements of the just term provisions of the constitution, compensation should be paid by way of a fast track to ensure that the Deane requirement in the Tasmanian dams case is satisfied. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Validating now and providing for compensation in five or 10 years time does not satisfy the constitutional requirements. Our fast track proposals permit effective native title holders to apply to the Federal Court for compensation. Claims can then be referred by consent of the parties to the tribunal. The court or the tribunal, on assessing the claims, can order compensation as long as it satisfies the requirements of the registration test in 190B. If the compensation is not on just terms, the Commonwealth will have to top it up, provide additional compensation, to rectify the failure. The government can also apply for an order from the Federal Court for a declaration. Let me anticipate the normal argument of the Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, about this. We have had this checked by senior Queen's Counsel, and the advice that we have is that this proposal meets the constitutional requirements of Brandy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be our much preferred approach if these acts could be validated by agreement as part of the ILUA&mdash;indigenous land use agreements. There is no better way to provide a cooperative spirit and there is no better way to implement the spirit of Wik than to ensure that coexistence is the motivating force. We are successful in amending the provisions in the bill to ensure that rep bodies can participate or there can be indigenous land use agreements in respect of past and intermediate period acts, and we would advocate that as a way of handling these particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have to go on living with each other after the validation. They have to coexist. One person asserting the brutal force of the law over others&mdash;`others' normally being Wik&mdash;and people not knowing their rights do not lead to a spirit of coexistence and reconciliation. The fair process that we provide, which is totally different from the government's, will enhance that spirit of coexistence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who are waiting in anticipation for this legislation to get through in substantial part and to those who think that if we pass this legislation in a reasonably modified form&mdash;I do not accept the definition they give to the word `reasonably'&mdash;there will not be a double dissolution and we can go on living 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10343"> happily together by the middle of next year, I say this: this issue will not go away. To the extent that there is injustice and for the time that there is injustice, indigenous Australians will not lie back and accept what this Senate is meting out to them. The issue will continue to haunt us until we provide a just regime for native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate confrontation that has been proposed and talked about by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in terms of a race debate is not our major worry. The major worry we have is that, given our diversity&mdash;the fact that so many of us come from different parts of the world&mdash;given that we have not been seen by the world to have adequately tackled the situation with our indigenous people and given that we are being seen by the world now as handling it very badly, the issue of race will affect us and haunt us socially both internally and internationally as it affects our image and consequently our trade potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not delude yourselves into thinking that if we give the Prime Minister something now Australia will settle down by the middle of next year into a cohesive society. I know, and deep down we all know, that what we are doing in this legislation is ripping the arms and legs off the system of native title. Indigenous Australians practising in the field know that full well. If we keep going the way that we have been going, we can guarantee that we will be haunted by issues dealing with our indigenous population in at least my generation and for longer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Doug Woolla and Jonathan Korkaktain, who are from Aurukun. We often talk about Wik as though somehow or other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it was perhaps a Latin phrase dreamed up by the High Court. In fact, it is a generic word which describes a number of groups who live on western Cape York. Doug, Jonathan and Norma Chevathun are here to watch the debate this week, and it is good to see them in the gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of validation of intermediate leases is one that has dominated the Wik debate because it is absolutely key to protection of native title in this country. How we treat all those thousands of titles issued on pastoral leases and other forms of title after Mabo is crucial. If we take the easy route and issue blanket validation, that is de facto  extinguishment of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what is the justification for doing this in defiance of the High Court Wik decision? The excuse used by the government&mdash;and, I have to say, some in the Labor Party&mdash;is that in 1993 there was legal advice floating around that native title would be extinguished on those leases. As if in any other legal case&mdash;sex discrimination, industrial relations; take your pick&mdash;it would be okay to say, `We are going to legislate in direct contradiction of the High Court, because the High Court's decision is not the same as some earlier legal advice.' When you look at it that way you can see that it is wrong, unfair and, worst of all, racially discriminatory, because it would not happen with any other High Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposed validation of these intermediate leases has in part the support of the Labor Party, for that is the effect of the Labor Party's position. It is only a hair's breadth away from the government on this issue, and that is where our amendments are going to try to keep the Labor Party honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record the Labor Party's history on this issue, for we know now why the ALP supports legalising unlawful leases. It is because the majority of those leases were issued by the Labor government in Queensland&mdash;about 1,500 out of 2,000 that were issued in the intermediate period between 1994 and 1996. These titles were issued by the Goss government without going through the process of the Native Title Act. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10344"> We know that there is an election coming up in Queensland which Peter Beattie wants to win. I presume he does not want to upset the applecart by going in against something his party did in government. And we do not even know where Mr Beattie stands on the discriminatory validation of pastoral leases where native title may exist, because he has not told us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we put these facts on the record, because the Labor Party is presenting itself as the great white knight on native title. But it has changed its policy on native title in the past few months, probably hoping that no&hyphen;one will notice. Well, the Democrats noticed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose some in the ALP will say it is mean of us to point out these inconsistencies, but there is a crucial reason why we do this. Labor is now painting itself as new Labor, new warm and fuzzy Labor that learned from its mistakes. Well, here is the hurdle which will determine whether we have new Labor or old Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid history reflects this sad story. Former Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss, has come a long way in embracing native title in recent days, but let me remind you of a few of his views when the Mabo legislation was being introduced back in 1993. When it came to mining and native title rights, Mr Goss made it clear that mining always came first. He would give pretty promises about native title and non&hyphen;discriminatory ways of extinguishing it and then he would turn around and try to elbow Aborigines out of the way if they were in the way of mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you some examples. Mr Goss told ABC Radio on 23 July 1993 that uncertainty over an earlier native title claim by the Wik people over the land near Weipa in Far North Queensland had to be removed to secure Comalco's mining project. Mr Goss said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That uncertainty is of concern, and we believe that the company, the State Government and the Federal Government are going to have to co&hyphen;operate to remove it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is not a lot of support for coexistence or recognition of Aboriginal rights there&mdash;just `Get out of the way, native title holders. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Comalco's coming through.' And I quote Mr Goss again on ABC Radio on 13 August 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My main concern is a 2 thousand jobs project . . . a Wik claim could be brought at any time against any project anywhere in Australia, so it really is a national responsibility in terms of creating jobs and winning investment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the time, Aboriginal people accused federal Labor of selling out to the states over Mabo. Noel Pearson said that the lowest common denominator in the native title debate had been set by Wayne Goss and the Queensland government. The former Premier of Queensland was all for validation; he was one of the chief proponents of it. He put intense pressure on federal Labor to validate all the illegal leases that may have had native title on them and to do it pronto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Wayne Goss has the dubious honour of issuing more of those unlawful intermediate titles than any other state leader, including the Nationals' Rob Borbidge. Of the new mining tenements issued between the Native Title Act 1994 and the Wik decision in December 1995, the Goss government gave out 1,582 mining tenements&mdash;73 per cent. The Borbidge government gave out 581 new mining tenements&mdash;a total of 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has the very dubious honour of holding the record for de facto extinguishment of native title in this country by issuing thousands of potentially unlawful titles on pastoral land. It ignored Paul Keating's Native Title Act and, when Aboriginal people showed their genuine distress at this, Mr Goss said that they had raised their hopes unrealistically. How patronising. But the Wik people continued their fight to get back to their traditional land. In December last year the High Court found some justice for them and recognised their native title. Now history is repeating itself. Vote&hyphen;hungry Queensland Labor leaned on Kim Beazley and got him to sell out Aboriginal people who may have native title surviving where around 25,000 intermediate titles are set to be validated by the government and the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to discuss the subject of legal advice for a moment. The government have steadfastly refused to release key pieces of legal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10345"> advice on the constitutionality of their bill. The opposition have quite rightly pursued them&mdash;vigorously pursued them&mdash;to have this advice released, with Democrat support. But what of the legal advice to the opposition? From newspaper reports we know that the Labor Party have received advice from Alec Shand QC on the government's amending legislation. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of last Tuesday week we read that Mr Shand said the bill was racially discriminatory in many areas, including validating past unlawful acts of the Queensland and Western Australian governments, deeming extinguishment of native title on thousands of leases. We know that the ALP have had legal advice from a top QC saying that the validation of intermediate period acts is racially discriminatory, yet they will support that discrimination by opposing this Australian Democrats and Greens amendment&mdash;an amendment which is supported by the National Indigenous Working Group. That is against their own legal advice, or at least as much of that legal advice as we can read in the newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that Mr Shand's advice went to the matter of the government bill yet, on Wednesday of last week, Mr Beazley is quoted as saying on ABC Radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have advice that what we are putting forward is 100 per cent kosher as far as the constitution is concerned, which differentiates our amendments dramatically from the government bill as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly this is not the Shand advice. Perhaps it was the Ron Castan advice referred to in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  article on 27 November by Margo Kingston which, like the Shand advice, has not been publicly released. I would again call on the Labor Party to release both sets of advice so that we can know. The Democrats say plainly and forthrightly to the Labor Party that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Release the legal opinions that you have or look foolish for pursuing the government over theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley's statement, if supported by advice, may be true. The ALP amendments may be 100 per cent kosher; however, his words create a false impression. Clearly the government's validations section in its bill is not 100 per cent kosher. Advice from Alec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Shand QC says so. How can the ALP now vote to maintain that section of the bill which Mr Shand says is racially discriminatory and put any spin on it other than that they are doing it to protect the interests of the Labor Party in the upcoming Queensland election? I have spoken earlier about the record of the Goss Labor government, which the ALP would like to cover up. They will do this by hiding behind a catch&hyphen;all, Racial Discrimination Act amendment. I say to them again: the validation section of this bill is not 100 per cent constitutionally kosher, it is not beneficial to indigenous Australians and you should release that legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to make a crucial point. The Howard government and the National Farmers Federation have been travelling all over the country claiming that they have to extinguish native title on pastoral leases to help the farmers. The Democrats asked some questions about that claim. We asked the Queensland government: how many pastoral leases have been issued in the state since the Native Title Act was passed in 1994? We wanted to know how many farmers' leases were potentially invalid. The answer was: not one. Not one pastoral lease has been issued in Queensland in the intermediate period between the Native Title Act 1994 and the Wik decision in 1996. The validation issue is one where Labor and the government are as one&mdash;almost as one. So who are they protecting? The other part of our question to the Queensland government was: how many mining titles have been issued in the intermediate period? The answer was: 2,163 mining tenements were issued in that time. The figures give the lie to the government's claim that their validation plans are about helping pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's speech on Sunday night conspicuously referred to farmers throughout. There was only one mention of the mining and resources industry. The speech constantly referred to farmers, to the concerns of farmers, to the needs for guarantees for farmers and to how sad it would be if Australia did not have a rural sector. Was the Prime Minister playing down the fact that mining companies stand to gain most from his extinguishment plans?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10346">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland the unlawful validation of those thousands of leases and the wiping out of native title will help miners and not one single farmer. It will help struggling Aussie battlers like Rio Tinto, BHP and Western Mining! That is what the Howard government wants to do. I am sad that Kim Beazley and the Labor Party also want to do that. It must be remembered that that is the truth behind the words we hear from Labor on native title.</PARA>

But I get angry when people like Premier Rob Borbidge say that Aboriginal people are greedy for asking for some control over their land near the site of the Ernest Henry mine, when these figures show that successive state and federal governments have bent over backwards to give the green light to mining, even if it means the unnecessary extinguishment of native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important part of the government's bill&mdash;one of the most important and one that we find it extremely disappointing that the opposition is not prepared to support. We believe that invalidity of the thousands of titles issued over pastoral leases between the operation of the Native Title Act and the Wik decision is simply not tenable. It is essential that the validation that occurred in the Native Title Act for all past acts be applied in the case of those otherwise valid titles and that leases issued in good faith between the operation of the Native Title Act and the Wik decision be validated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The titles were issued in good faith, in our view, for the following reasons. There is absolutely no doubt that the Native Title Act was drafted on the presumption that pastoral leases extinguished native title. As former Senator Gareth Evans said in this place in the 1993 debate, the Keating government was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proceeding on the assumption that the native title had been extinguished by the pastoral leases concerned; that is the clear intimation of the High Court so far as the common law position is concerned . . . The working assumption is that the vesting of a pastoral lease extinguishes native title, so there is nothing left to claim. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is clearly the state of the law as a result of the Mabo judgment, and the lead judgment of Chief Justice Brennan stated that leaseholds extinguished native title. There was no suggestion that there should be any distinction in relation to pastoral leases, and of course Chief Justice Brennan was entirely consistent between the Mabo and the Wik decisions. In Wik he made it quite clear that a pastoral lease fitted the description of lease, as described by him in Mabo, and that it completely extinguished native title&mdash;and he was joined by Justices McHugh and Dawson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo law&mdash;that is, that all leaseholds extinguish native title&mdash;was reflected by Justice French in the Waanyi case in February 1995, by the majority of the full Federal Court in the Waanyi case on 1 November 1995 and by Justice Drummond in the first hearing on the Wik case in early 1996. They were restatements of the law that pastoral leases extinguished native title. The Native Title Tribunal itself did not accept any claims over pastoral leases without reservations for Aboriginal people from early 1994 to the middle of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our view, therefore, that governments that issued titles over pastoral leases were operating on the valid assumption that the law was that pastoral leases extinguished native title&mdash;and, indeed, that was the law. What happened in Wik was that the law was changed and, as a result of the Wik decision, pastoral leases could no longer be presumed to automatically extinguish native title. We know that now to be the law&mdash;that they do not necessarily extinguish native title from 23 December 1996 forward. But we believe that governments acted entirely in good faith in issuing titles over pastoral leases and other leases between the operation of the Native Title Act and 23 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Keating government went out of its way to assure everybody and to make it absolutely and fundamentally clear that pastoral leases extinguished native title. So it is quite unreasonable to suggest that state governments should have acted in any other way than they did in issuing titles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we are talking about nearly 23,000 various permits, licences, leases, et 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10347"> cetera, that were issued in that period in good faith. Any suggestion that this parliament should not provide that they be validated would be a gross dereliction of our responsibilities to the Australian nation and to the certainty which the national economy, the investors and the human beings involved in this process require. This involves the lives and livelihoods of many people&mdash;as we are seeing with the Ernest Henry mine case where there is a huge investment, based on a title issued in this period, employing Aboriginal people and generating jobs, income and export income for this country. You cannot have a situation where there is any doubt about the legal validity of such titles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that 1994, 1995, 1996 period, we think it is essential that our validation regime be put in place. We are absolutely amazed that the Labor Party is not prepared to support it. I hate to think what the Queensland and Western Australian Labor parties think of the position adopted by their federal colleagues on this question, because to leave some doubt over these titles is a gross dereliction of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the Labor Party and the parliament felt it appropriate to provide for blanket validation of everything that had occurred prior to 1994 for the reason that certainty was essential. As former Attorney&hyphen;General Lavarch said on 24 November 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the possibility that some past acts which affect native title may have been rendered invalid, particularly by the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, but also potentially by other laws, the Commonwealth has decided to include in its legislation for the validation of such past acts in order to remove any doubt whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly the situation we face now. I agree with Labor's Attorney&hyphen;General: it is essential that in the case of the titles issued in this period we remove any doubt whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gareth Evans, in one of his more colourful statements in a debate in this chamber said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole point of this particular provision about validation of past invalid acts is to, with a sweep of the legislative pen, validate any past act that may be invalid for the particular reasons spelt out in the legislation, namely, the interaction of the existence of native title with some other law. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, it was felt appropriate then by the former government and by this parliament that that validation be provided. We think that in the circumstances we now face where, clearly, there was a change of the law&mdash;the law changed as a result of Wik&mdash;it is absolutely irresponsible of this parliament not to ensure the validity of the titles issued in good faith in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our validation regime is not as sweeping as Gareth Evans's sweep of the legislative pen; it is a more limited validation regime than that. It covers only acts and grants done on land in relation to which it was reasonable to assume that native title had been extinguished. It does not extend to acts done on land only previously the subject of a licence or a reservation or which has always been vacant crown land. It also does not extend to invalid acts consisting of the making of legislation, except where the legislation itself directly creates an estate or makes a grant or a reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made our position abundantly clear in the public arena. I do not need to delay the Senate by again putting our case; I think you understand it. But we are absolutely clear on the need for this validation regime. We have provided the proper provisions in relation to compensation and non&hyphen;extinguishment where it is a non&hyphen;extinguishing act. Where it is not exclusive possession that is being granted, the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies and full just terms compensation. But, as a matter of ensuring the certainty of Australian law, we believe this validation regime is essential. We have a number of technical and other amendments to this section which I will formally move now. I move:</PARA>

Amendment No. 51 is an amendment to proposed section 232B which defines the term `category A intermediate period act'. The amendment removes subsections (5) and (6) from 232B. These subsections are to be removed out of concern that they may have resulted in the creation of some national parks being included in the definition of category A intermediate period acts. This was never the intention and the amendment simply puts that beyond doubt. Amendment 52 is a similar provision to ensure the exclusion of:</PARA>

All that Aboriginal people are asking for is that the native title rights are recognised on these leases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you suggested that the state governments acted in good faith. In a moment I will go through a little bit of history to show you why that simply is not the case. It was well known that this is a live issue&mdash;it was made very clear in this chamber during the Mabo debate&mdash;so let us look at what you are asking us to do. You are asking us to use our votes to retrospectively endorse various actions of state governments between the commencement of the Native Title Act and the Hight Court's decision on the Wik case. The Democrats believe that this retrospectivity, presented here as `validation of intermediate period acts', is unjust. We are very surprised indeed that the ALP is supporting you in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind senators that, in 1993, parliament was aware of potential state acts which were open to challenge and had a very strong view on the matter. In presenting the government's bill to the Senate, Senator Chris Schacht tabled a second reading speech which made the point quite clearly. I will quote from that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has four key aspects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provision for clear and certain validation of past acts&mdash;including grants and laws&mdash;if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later on in the same second reading speech, under the title `Validation and Security for Existing Grants', he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill sets out a regime for the States to validate grants with certainty. It does not prevent States and Territories from attempting to validate on their own terms. But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not, in that case, help meet any resulting costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me repeat that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not in that case help meet any resulting costs. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is clear that that was the Labor position in 1993. A line was drawn at that time and we said, `No more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the Australian Democrats were also very concerned about the potential for renegade states to try to get around the Native Title Act, and we proposed a number of amendments to ensure that this did not happen. Then Senator Cheryl Kernot made our concerns clear in her speech at the second reading stage. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage the Democrats intend to move an amendment to clarify that, should there be any ambiguity in future time, the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail because it provides protection for native title, and an overarching legislative and constitutional protection for that title is essential. It is essential to prevent capricious actions by state governments and, even in the foreseeable future, by the Commonwealth government itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How prophetic that statement was. There was, it turns out, no more capricious government than the Goss Labor government in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, it was crystal clear. A majority of the parliament, over the howls of the coalition parties, decided that the line would be drawn at the time of the commencement of the 1993 act. It goes to the heart of the essential agreement between the parties in framing that original act that trade&hyphen;offs involve the agreement of indigenous communities to validation of past acts and grants in exchange for, in the future, agreeing to the right to negotiate. The coalition government, which opposed this whole issue in 1993, is now trying to water it down on both points. The ALP, by voting against the Democrats&hyphen;Greens amendment, is aiding and abetting in the process for reasons, I would argue, of pragmatism not of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party also made it crystal clear in 1993 that any state government which sought to get around this law did so at their own peril. Between 1993 and 1997, the Labor Party changed its mind somewhat. Indeed, I would argue they have gone soft on this issue. They will not do as they said they would; that is, stare down state governments who tried it on. Basically, the ALP has done a backflip on this issue by saying, `We were prepared to talk tough during the 1993 debate when the prime transgressor was the Court Liberal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10351"> government, but we are not prepared to talk tough on this in 1997 when the prime transgressor is the Goss Labor government'&mdash;certainly not on the eve of an election which, we now read, is probably going to be fought in Queensland on this very issue by Premier Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what we have is the Goss legacy which has led the ALP to be moving their own amendments and not supporting what we are arguing is directly in line with decisions taken by this chamber in 1993. They have done a 180&hyphen;degree turn from their 1993 position. Any potential claim on the converted leases which has been done in direct contravention of the Keating government's legislation, and indeed is in defiance of their direct warnings, will now be extinguished with the collusion of new Labour. I do not think, in this debate, we are going to change the Labor Party's mind because I think their priorities are set, and their priority is winning the Queensland election. Hopefully, all senators listening to this debate will understand what the government is doing. It is trying to turn around what was decided in this chamber in 1993 to the advantage of those people who are benefiting from state government decisions which are not just contrary to the act but, if anyone bothered to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the time, directly contrary to what was stated very clearly in this chamber as the will of this parliament.</PARA>

Once again, state governments have sabotaged the native title process and will, with the assistance of both the government and the ALP, get away with it.

The High Court has clarified the law; the High Court has not changed the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that in Western Australia there are many examples where the Court government have ignored the future act provisions. We know that they are, and were, sabotaging the Native Title Act. We know that there were three very expensive abortive native title High Court challenges and I think it is quite clear why the Court government in Western Australia would like to make the issue go away. But it is not going away and I stand strongly with the Australian Democrats on this issue. It is not good enough for the ALP as well to merely get into what they think is pragmatic and election politics in order to prepare for the Queensland election. This is a massive issue which sends a signal to state governments that they are not subject to Commonwealth laws.

We say to the government: you have not treated that advice seriously enough, nor have you treated the issue of race seriously enough with respect to this bill. You want certainty, but the only certainty you will get by slavishly pursuing this particular proposal is that you will finish up in the High Court within hours of this legislation being given effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only certainty you will get by going down your road of validation is a High Court challenge and continual arguments about the racist nature of this legislation. You will not get certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You quoted former Attorney&hyphen;General Michael Lavarch and said you agreed with him, that to eradicate doubt you have to legislate in this way. Why did you not go back further to see what the previous Labor government did in terms of its validation regime? We recognise full well that, if you were to baldly validate, you would have both RDA problems and constitutional problems. That is precisely why, in formulating the 1993 legislation&mdash;and it is something you have never been able to accept&mdash;we actually put together an overall package, a special measure of overall benefit to indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we went to provide certainty in terms of confirmation. That is why we went to provide certainty in terms of processes. That is why we went to accept as a trade-off for their general common law rights the right to negotiate in certain areas. That is why we adopted the social justice package, which has not been delivered on. That is why we adopted the indigenous land use fund. There is a way to meet the constitutional requirements and the requirements of non-discrimination. The RDA provides that way of doing it&mdash;that is, it provides a special measure with an overall beneficial impact to the group with which you are dealing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not doing that here. You say in respect of some areas that they are of benefit to some indigenous Australians. But they have told you, Australia and the world that those beneficial measures are essentially no more than embroidery. That is something that you will have to worry about if this legislation finally gets Governor-General approval, if it gets Executive Council approval. That is the one thing you will have to worry about within 24 to 48 hours of that approval. You will be in the Hight Court and you will be arguing over this particular point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that people acted in good faith and, as a consequence, have a real right to certainty. We do not disagree with that. We do not say that in all circumstances they acted in good faith, but we do understand that in most circumstances people on the ground have been the victims of this&mdash;and the major victims of this, of course, have been indigenous Australians. You go on to say that your validation regime is nowhere near as comprehensive as ours was in 1993. But, let us face it, Wik is one&hyphen;tenth of the problem that Mabo was in terms of trying to get a legislative solution. Mabo was an unprecedented decision of the High Court which laid down and confirmed in our legal system the existence of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have been asked to pick up some problems with respect to that intermediate period between the Native Title Act and this legislation. In doing that, you have used Wik as an excuse for a wholesale slaughter of the Native Title Act, and you do not pretend to do otherwise. We say to both you and the minor parties that you can validate in a constitutional, non-racist way. Our 1993 legislation was endorsed in its validity by the High Court in Western Australia and the Commonwealth, and it was endorsed particularly because of a number of factors. It did have general agreement of indigenous Australians&mdash;and that is a factor of relevance in the legal system&mdash;and it was a package overall, a special measure which acted in an overall way, to the beneficial interest of indigenous Australians. Your package does not do that. We maintain that our package does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been accused of backflips. We have been accused of pragmatism. I suppose all of us in this place by the very fact that we are in this place can be criticised for being pragmatic. Even Senator Brown, who is looking at me intently, I am sure sometimes can be accused of being pragmatic. But we are part of the parliamentary process of government and we have to confront problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that we are confronting now are different from the problems that we confronted in 1993. The issues we are confronting now are different from those issues. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10353"> The stark reality is that you have had thousands of permits, leases or whatever issued over that intermediate period. That has already happened. The other reality is that, with respect to probably 95 per cent of them, they would attract the expedited procedures provisions of the Native Title Act. With respect to the others, there might be&mdash;and I say `might be'&mdash;some issues, but the advice that we keep getting is that, apart from a small handful, there is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you and to the parliament that, under the Native Title Act, no-one disputes that all those entitlements, interest granted, will have an ongoing effect. Section 29 notices can be issued, but those who have attracted those interests, those who have obtained those interests, will be able to keep on exercising them until those processes are completed. Let us face it: under those processes there is no right of veto. So with all those interests they will have continuing effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that will not be satisfied, though, under the existing act, which is what the minority parties want to pursue, is the immediate problem of indigenous Australians. Whilst those interests have been acquired and people exercise them, indigenous Australians will be waiting for compensation. Under the existing act, under the provisions that you want to protect, they will be waiting for five or 10 years to get it. What we say is that, in validating, put into place a fast track provision for compensation, the one that we are proposing, and ensure that there is some justice to those people as well. If this is the Native Title Act, that should be of immediate concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it all boils down to it, essentially your choice is whether you make indigenous Australians wait a decade for compensation or whether you provide a fast track mechanism for them to obtain it in the immediate future. That is why I say there is a new problem here now, and the challenge for us is to see how we can tackle that with a degree of equity. The government does not provide that equity in its system. It does not provide any fast track proposal. It does not provide the pro 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cedural guarantees that we provide, and it is worth listing those procedural guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those guarantees go to the capacity to protect sacred sites. They go to issues of curtailing the extent of validation. They go to issues of non-extinguishment. They go to proper processes, procedures and appeals with respect to non-genuine acts. They go to, as I say, compensation. They go to the capacity of the Federal Court to ensure some override in limited circumstances. They also go to the capacity of this matter to be resolved by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was always going to be a three-way spat, and I suppose the surprising thing is that it has not happened earlier in the process. I do say in the spirit of some degree of cooperation here that it is very easy to accuse us of being pragmatic but, if you were an indigenous Australian, then you would want to get, I think, something out of this process. Okay, we are not pursuing the preferred model of the Indigenous Working Group here but, for those living on the ground with the consequences of this decision, let us try to provide some immediate justice for them, and that is what I say our proposal does.</PARA></SPEECH>

The ALP amendments confirm validation for pastoral activities and pastoral leases granted before January 1994 but do not validate leases granted following government actions in the period between January 1994 and June 1996. They introduce a gazetted act to cover mining leases. These gazetted acts have conditions, and the conditions are that the government has to provide to representative bodies when issuing leases a notification of the description of land and project within four months, then there is a 90-day period for representative bodies to take action to the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some 5,000 mining leases in Queensland&mdash;and I also think a great number in Western Australia&mdash;were issued or renewed between 1 January 1994 and 1996. We saw a claim on Ernest Henry mine by the Mittakoodi and Juhnjlar people and, if the government gets its legislation through, that would be prevented.

I want to say to Senator Margetts&mdash;because I do not doubt her sincerity in this debate&mdash;that strenuous negotiations, large negotiations, went on for months and probably years between the local Aboriginal community and the Ernest Henry mine. I think there were negotiations that the Aboriginal people there got the contract to run the trucking business and they came out of it pretty well. They were happy with it. Jobs were provided for them in the mine. Then another group of people came in over the top and lodged a claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 5,000 mining leases in Queensland that will be affected&mdash;they will be open to claims&mdash;if the Labor Party amendments get up or Senator Margetts's amendments get up. There are a number of people out there who, going on to Christmas, will be wondering about their jobs in the mine, including the Aboriginal people who have gone into hock to buy the trucks which they probably purchased on hire purchase. They will be concerned about this claim on the Ernest Henry mine. All these mining companies do go into very long and involved negotiations with the Aboriginal people. These leases have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issued. Millions of dollars&mdash;about $304 million&mdash;have gone into this mine to get it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this to everyone in the Senate. The exploration budgets of the Australian mining companies are going up, but they are not going up as fast as they are spending money in exploration overseas. You just do not switch on a mine overnight. It takes six, seven or eight years to get it up. The exploration budgets are not being spent in Australia. They are going overseas and putting money into South America, and that is where they have got to do it. Their bottom line is that they have to do the best for their shareholders, so they are walking away from Australia. The result of that is that we are now seeing the downturn&mdash;and we will see it more in the future&mdash;of mining in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> held that native title is extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Former Prime Minister Keating said in his second reading speech on the Native Title Act:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the bill of the government's view that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As to Senator Margetts's objection to my statement that the law was changed, I am a humble former solicitor. I refer you to the opinion of the Solicitor&hyphen;General, Dr Gavan Griffith, probably Australia's most experienced constitutional lawyer. He said in his opinion on the Native Title Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Somewhat unexpectedly, a bare majority in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik</EMPHASIS>  peoples versus Queensland (1996) 141 ALR 191 (Wik) held that the grant of pastoral leases under Queensland law did not confer exclusive possession and therefore did not necessarily extinguish native title rights and interests. I say unexpectedly because, as the powerful dissent of the Chief Justice confirms, the effect of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik</EMPHASIS>  (with its recognition of coexistence, factual enquiry and possible revival) effectively overruled much of which had been

<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is not my humble view&mdash;it is the view of the Solicitor&hyphen;General of Australia that that is what occurred. We accept that it has occurred. The whole point of the Native Title Amendment Bill is to acknowledge that legal fact and to incorporate the Wik decision into the Native Title Act. But in so doing, one of the fundamentals problems we have to deal with is the validation of acts and leases and things issued in good faith in that intermediate period.

There is one point I want to make about that and it is this: if the High Court says the law is the law, that is it. There has been an attitude taken where people say, `Well, look, the High Court in some way did the wrong thing in coming to the decision it did in Wik.' That is not right.

As a parliament we have not fulfilled our function of giving the High Court the support we should have as one of the three arms of government. I think we have failed in that. I just make that point. Parliament can change the law relating to those matters over which it has power, but it should not change the law on the basis that the High Court has somehow done the wrong thing or the reprehensible thing. That is not correct. The High Court has acted in a very honourable, proper and direct way in the decision it has made on the matter of Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am in the mode of vindicating things, I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> this morning this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Brian Harradine's role in the point&hyphen;by&hyphen;point destruction of the Howard Government's Wik legislation makes a mockery of the democratic system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that Senator Harradine is one senator amongst others. To blame him for, as it were, determining the fate of the nation is a wrong assessment of what goes on. We are all here as senators and we all should take a position according to our consciences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to get into a parochial mode. The debate concerns all Australia, but a lot of the examples are taken from Queensland and Western Australia. I just want to put in a plea for Victoria. I notice Mr Geoff Clark is in the gallery. He has done great work, as have others, for the indigenous community in Victoria. Victoria has a very big indigenous community. It does not have any pastoral leases, but it has other problems that have to be solved, such as the closure of government roads and whether farmers can use them for transit and what have you. Although Queensland and Western Australia are great states, we have our problems and relationships to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solve in Victoria. I have noticed Geoff Clark. I might also mention Monica Morgan and the Yorta Yorta tribe. They have done great work there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to do something now that will require the leave of the Senate. To show we have a big indigenous group in Victoria, I have some documents here which are headed up `Petition' but which do not, by any means, conform to the way petitions ought to be got together. I have shown this to various people around the chamber. It is a non-broadcast day. I seek leave of the Senate to table what is headed up as `Petition' but is really not a petition from a young man Damien Cook from Castlemaine. There are all sorts of addresses here from people all over the great state of Victoria. You would appreciate this, Senator McGauran.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to emphasise what the Senate is discussing at this stage in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF>  under the general heading that is being used of `validation'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to speak on this in particular because it is an issue that is particularly relevant to Queensland. Western Australia is the other state that is mentioned a lot. I take very seriously the responsibility I have of representing my state. I think it is important that someone stand up in this chamber to speak for justice for indigenous people in Queensland. The Democrats are doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to stress again in this debate that of the many amendments that this chamber has introduced to this bill this one is the one where there is a very clear divide between what the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party are apparently agreeing to do on this matter. I think it is important to emphasise why the Labor Party is taking this course of action. It is a sad course of action it seems determined to take. Certainly journal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10358"> ists who have been following the debate so far know why. An example of this insight was Margo Kingston's article on Thursday last week, which had the headline `Labor puts principles through hoops'. It said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kim Beazley, a pro-development man clinging to a marginal seat in the rabidly anti-Wik State of Western Australia, was desperate to do a deal with the Coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">His deputy Gareth Evans was equally hard&hyphen;headed&mdash;and made a personal offer to negotiate privately to John Howard at US President Bill Clinton's dinner at Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard's response was to reveal that Evans had told him not to worry about "Daryl", his firebrand Aboriginal Affairs spokesman.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Kingston went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Left did get rolled&mdash;on validation of the States' illegal grants of mining permits since 1994.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was because Labor feared it would blow its chances at the pending Queensland election. Labor also got rolled on the right to negotiate over coastal waters. That is basically it in a nutshell. The Labor spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs and the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General were rolled by the right&hyphen;wing leadership group of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are the ghosts of the last Queensland election so haunting the leadership of the ALP that they will backflip on this key principle? Again, it is important to emphasise that this issue we are discussing now is a key principle. It is worth a quick reminder of the context behind this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor now holds only two House of Representative seats in Queensland and one of those, the seat of Brisbane, would have been lost if not for the flow of Democrat preferences to the sitting member, Arch Bevis&mdash;something I am well aware of because I was the Democrat candidate for that seat at the last election. Labor knew they were on the nose in Queensland for many months before the fall of the Keating government. After all, in 1995 the Goss government had managed to turn a healthy lead in the election campaign into a near loss and eventually defeat thereby surpassing, outperforming or underperforming, depending on what you want to call it, even the mediocre performances of Nick Greiner before him and John Wayne Olsen fairly recently after him.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time Mr Goss and Queensland Labor blamed Paul Keating for their defeat. Perhaps there was some truth in this assertion because the then Deputy Prime Minister, Kim Beazley, was wheeled in to try to stem the tide and Mr Keating was kept out of the state of Queensland. I guess it must have been a bitter experience for Mr Beazley. Not only did Wayne Goss lose office around the time just leading into the 1996 federal election after the Mundingburra by-election, but Mr Beazley himself could not hold back the tide at all from the federal poll in March of that year. It seems the spectre of a repeat, where Labor is kept out of office in the imminent round of state and federal elections, because of Queensland, must haunt the opposition leader in a very personal way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, as we know, the National Party Premier, Mr Borbidge, has already declared his eagerness to run native title as the central issue in the next state election in Queensland. I and the Democrats as a party have been very critical for some time of Mr Borbidge's inflammatory actions on this issue, but at least he has displayed his colours and made clear where he stands, unlike the state Labor leader, Mr Beattie, who has been unfortunately quiet on the native title issue. He seems unfortunately reluctant to speak up for the key issues of justice that are at stake here. Again, they are at stake in this issue as much as any other in the entire bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans, under pressure on this issue, explains it away as just a decision of a party which is an alternative government&mdash;this pragmatism that Senator Bolkus was referring to before. I also see this as a sideswipe at the Democrats which is not unexpected, I suppose, coming from Mr Evans, but it says more about Labor than it does about my own party. It gives a big signal as to what Labor would be like if they got back into government&mdash;that is, they will be the same as they have always been: selling out on core principles as soon as they sense that votes or corporate dollars in donations may be at risk. A reasonable interpretation of Mr Evans's comments is simply to say that Labor will continue to do whatever it takes to get elect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10359"> ed, even at the expense of those they claim to champion&mdash;in this case, indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that background, an explanation of the ALP's clear motive in basically supporting this reprehensible section of this bill&mdash;which is, in my view, a form of retrospective extinguishment by governments that refused to follow the processes that were laid out in the original Native Title Act and just wanted to do it their own way, because they did not want to have to negotiate and did not want to talk to indigenous people&mdash;is that they just wanted to help the mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to direct my final comment to Senator Bolkus. I know that you have to put up a good show in this debate, as is your role, just as my predecessor must now also toe the line of the party that she is now in, if she is to get on&mdash;no matter how offensive the policy decision is. I am sorry that you were rolled, but you must understand that the Democrats must take this issue to a vote to have it clearly on the public record that Beazley's Labor senators went soft in a spectacular way on a key matter of principle and in doing so caused a great injustice. It is a shame to me, as a Queensland senator, that this betrayal of justice will have such particular impacts on my home state. Just as Labor did on work for the dole, now this backflip seems to have happened. The reasons for doing it seem to be remarkably similar.</PARA></SPEECH>

I sat here and copped a bit of criticism, but can I say to the last speaker that we have actually spent 25 or maybe 30 hours on the debate so far and I have got to say that, on one point or another, all contributions actually addressed something that we needed to address. I have got to say to Senator Bartlett that that was probably the worst contribution that we have had in the debate. I say that in a spirit of being constructive because I think perhaps you can learn from this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to look at the public record, on 4 April this year the Labor Party, under the signatures of the leader, Kim Beazley, Gareth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Evans, myself and Daryl Melham, put out a statement. In that statement we made it very clear that we were going down this road in terms of intermediate period act validation. That was an agreed position some seven months ago and it was a position that was adopted by the party just a few weeks ago. We have some 350 or so amendments and I think it has been an enormous management and policy achievement to be able to get primarily the four people involved agreed on all those amendments. I, in no way, feel as if I have been rolled. Anyone who thinks they can roll Daryl is probably deluding themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us put on the record, and in the spirit of non&hyphen;confrontation, that this has been a long&hyphen;stated position of the party. It has been a long&hyphen;stated position because right from the start we have been trying to confront the new issues, as opposed to merely defending something that might be in legislation but which we thought did not provide a constructive outcome at this particular stage. In saying that we understand quite clearly that the indigenous working groups have a different position. Can I say to you that the degree of cooperation between them and us, in terms of the overall package and an ongoing relationship, recognises there are some differences, but we are working constructively together in a very friendly atmosphere and very few of them, if any, confronted us with those same allegations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is reasonable for us to ask Senator Bolkus to explore that a little bit further given that this is a very major departure from the working group's position and certainly from our position. To dismiss this as being a small difference which we all need to bear is pretty unreasonable. As I understand it&mdash;I will go back over what my colleague Senator Lees has said, and others here today&mdash;the validation of past acts between 1975 and 1992 was agreed to by indigenous people on the understanding that there would be a strong right to negotiate. That was ultimately reflected in the Native Title Act. My question 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10360"> is: why is the ALP now re&hyphen;opening what was a deal at that time? I understand that deal involved Mr Keating at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the position that concerns me fundamentally about this debate, and that is the absence of an indigenous voice in this chamber. If I were a member of the indigenous community at this stage, I would be thinking back to 1993 and the passage of the Native Title Act and the expectation that this was going to be a balanced outcome leading to a negotiated process for the establishment of a native title claim as well as for the progress of the interests of pastoralists, miners and other stakeholders. That expectation has led to three years in which, at best, one or two small claims have gone the way of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But we are discussing here more than 20,000 mining and pastoral lease determinations being given. That is the balance that we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seen in the last four years. That is about 20 per day, if you do a rough calculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position for the indigenous people who have found their law being repeatedly overridden by the laws of materialism, which are core to our society and which are so often determined in this place, is that they had to then go to the courts to get a determination as to whether or not those 20,000 leases to mining and pastoral interests, licences and determinations did shut them out. They felt that surely this could not be so after the promise of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right through this process, right up to the High Court, all stakeholders knew that there was a question mark over this. Yet Senator Minchin says that it was done in good faith. The Labor Party says likewise. I say that it was done in the expectation that the indigenous interests would be extinguished. But the High Court found that that was not the case. It determined that there is an indigenous interest here, even under our system of laws. There was a renewed feeling that something would go the indigenous people's way in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are today saying, `We'll deal with that. We'll retrospectively take away the rights that the indigenous people had over those three years. We'll retrospectively validate the illegal, because that is in the interests of this materialist society.' The land users see the country which the indigenous people have such a deep, ancient, cultural and spiritual attachment to as a place for sustenance and the making of money. That must prevail. That is what this is about. That is why the two great parties, the big, old parties, are saying, `We are going to retrospectively change the law so that those moneyed interests get their way over the spiritual and traditional interests of the indigenous people. It was even illegal under our laws, so we will change our laws not now and into the future but retrospectively.' If I were an indigenous person under those circumstances, I would feel crushed and demoralised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how they can keep going. It is a remarkable testimony to their spirit and their attachment to the land that long ago they did not take other forms of action to be part of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10361"> this process, which comes under the much abused word  `reconciliation'. The Labor Party may not like this, but it is on trial, along with the Liberal Party and Senator Harradine, in this circumstance. We are saying to the indigenous people of this country, `Yes, you had to go to our courts to get justice. However, now that you have it, we in this parliament are going to retrospectively take it away from you again.' That is what this is about. It is nothing more and nothing less. It makes me ashamed to be a part of this place.</PARA>

That person would be told, `You are quite welcome to leave this place, you are quite welcome to stay out of the courts and you are quite welcome to leave your land. Just get out of our way, because you are in the way.' That is the sentiment of the majority in this place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saving grace is that there is a different voice in this place. Perhaps it is appropriate that it is a minority voice. Perhaps we can take strength from the indigenous people by saying that, minority or not, we are here, we are going to stay, and we will persist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that it is matter of ensuring certainty of the law. For whom? It is for the miners in particular, and for some pastoral companies. Don't indigenous people deserve certainty in the law? How is it that when they get it we retrospectively take it away from them? There is no doubt that what is happening here now is racially discriminatory, and this parliament is doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that in some way or other it can be rectified further down the line. I say that to Senator Harradine, as well as to the other components of this majority. What is happening here is racially discriminatory. It is retrospectively taking legal entitlements from one group and giving them to another on racial lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that human beings are involved in this process. That was a some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what revealing and unintended statement. Human beings are involved, and they are spread right across this country. They have been here for aeons, and they must be wondering about the shallowness of the behaviour of the newcomers who act in this fashion.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10366"> 7 to 10 are in fact a representation of an extraordinary generosity on behalf of the National Indigenous Working Group. I would like to explain that the National Indigenous Working Group has accepted the potential to validate low impact acts and acts which fall under a limited definition of pastoral activity&mdash;as in the Northern Territory act&mdash;under this act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of generosity now being offered is an extraordinary level of compromise; it is not, I do not think, anyone's preferred option. It does not, as has been suggested, even require or demand any full right to negotiate. What it is saying is that there should be six months in which the various parties can reach agreement. I do not think that is an unreasonable thing to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 8 provides a mechanism for governments to validate certain intermediate period acts by agreement. It would be activated by the government giving notice to the representative body within three months of the commencement of the new provision. It involves negotiations for up to six months from the date of commencement of the section and it gives the government an incentive to move promptly to identify relevant acts and to seek validation by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 9 replaces the government's complex scheme under section 22B based on the current past act categories with a simple provision which states that the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies to any validated intermediate period acts. Amendment 7 is a consequential amendment removing the definitions of the various categories of intermediate period acts. Amendment 10 is also a consequential amendment. There is an amendment 11 but the reason that is not being moved with the other group at the moment is that, along with amendment 176 and amendment 250 and 253, they are identical to those of the ALP. We will be dealing with those subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate to accept this level of compromise and generosity. It seems the generosity is all one&hyphen;sided at the moment and the very least the Senate can do is accept what, for many people, is a fairly difficult decision. I know, also from the point of view

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has a raft of amendments here. The current situation with respect to renewals and extensions is somewhat anomalous under the existing act. The renewal of validated past acts are wider in range and less beneficial to Aboriginal and native title holders, and there are narrow provisions in the future acts regime. Renewals currently arising from validated past acts are not limited, as they are for future acts, to commercial, agricultural, pastoral and residential leases. That is where we start from. Where we get to with the government's proposals is, once again, on the road to curtailment, infringement and incursion upon indigenous Australian rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that, with respect to a lot of the opposition amendments, Senator Harradine has moved amendments that are similar in nature, and I will note those as I go along through the list of concerns that we have before I get to the major concern we have with these proposals. In terms of the time period for renewals, regrants and extensions of leases, both Senator Harradine and the opposition oppose a capacity the government is trying to legislate for&mdash;that is, for renewals to be of a longer period and, in fact, to lead to a perpetual lease arrangement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second concern we have is the government's proposals extend the date for legally enforceable rights to be created. We see this as unnecessary. It has nothing to do with Wik. Basically, it extends the validation regime further to include the relevant time for the definition of validated past acts to include rights that are legally enforceable as of 23 December 1996 rather than 1 January 1994. Basically, it tries to render inoperative for more than a two-year period&mdash;almost a three-year period&mdash;the operations of the Native Title Act with respect to this area. That is something for which there really is no justification at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third concern is that the government's proposal further expands the concept of renewals, regrants and extensions of leases, licences and permits. Basically, the concept is going to be broadened under proposed section 24GB, GD, GE or HA to include acts consisting of primary production, off&hyphen;farm activities, rights to third parties on pastoral leases to remove timber, quarries, et cetera, and provisions relating to the management of water and airspace. We think that is too broad. Once again, it has nothing to do with Wik. It far outreaches the ambit of Wik. There is no need to extend it to such a broad activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also wants to allow renewals up to the level of primary production. Their qualification is, for so long as the majority of the area covered by the new pastoral and agricultural lease is still for primary production activities, the renewal can be for a range of activities as wide as that. We obviously have a concern with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, you are talking here of acquiring people's property rights in a racially discriminatory manner, and you are doing so retrospectively. If anything has been formulated to incur problems in the High Court, this particular provision will be it. It is racially discriminatory. It is retrospective. It is an acquisition of property rights. It is an acquisition for which no just terms compensation in terms of the processes required by the constitution are made available. Once again, we have the government's ambit claim to extinguish in these circumstances. There is no justification for extinguishment here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10370">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major concern that people should have about this particular part of the legislation is the effect that it would have to mining and lease renewals. Currently, the right to negotiate does not permit a renewal or an extension of a right to mine other than where such a right was created in the actual instrument, the lease or whatever, which created the original right to mine. That is provided for in section 26(1)(c). Section 24(1)(c) permits the renewal or extension of any right to mine by deeming it a permissible future act, removing it from the NTA protection, particularly to the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposal is different from the government's because we exclude mining leases from the application of section 24(1)(c), that is our amendment R79, whilst the government's proposal permits renewals of mining leases without native title holders having resort to the future act protection of the Native Title Act. This, I pretend to the Senate, is a much more damaging infringement of native title interests than the previous one. It is much more damaging and ongoing and has a lasting effect in an area which potentially could provide indigenous Australians with some degree of satisfaction by having the right to negotiate operating in an ongoing manner in real live developing situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, let me state that this has not seemed to have got the attention that the previous proposal did. As I say, this is an ongoing concern. The right to negotiate will be removed from an area of renewals in respect of mining leases in an area which is of ongoing, critical concern to indigenous Australians. We oppose the renewal and we do so for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mining leases are in a category of their own. Whilst the area of the lease may remain the same upon renewal, no-one doubts that the activity grows, develops, extends and expands in a whole range of different ways. The activity of a renewed lease can be quite different&mdash;enormously different&mdash;from that of the original lease. This renewed lease activity may include impacts which, for instance, have a substantially greater effect upon native title. You may move from an underground mine to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an open cut mine and that is quite common as high grade seams are mined out. This has a direct impact on indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mine may be substantially increased in size. It may entail the retention of a substantially larger work force and the construction of mining towns and infrastructure. There are consequential environmental and social impacts&mdash;such as liquor outlets, people visiting and desecrating sacred sites and the wholesale change in the way of life of native title holders. This is all due to the pressures created by growing work forces. As I say, mining operations grow in size and in impact and there needs to be some check, some capacity for indigenous Australians to have their rights heard in respect of renewals on mining leases. They need a right to negotiate in these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be changes in technology and techniques, such as different methods of waste disposal. Other variables may occur over the long life of a mine. These changes all have a potentially serious implication for native title holders, yet the government wants to deny them the right to negotiate over these impacts when the renewal period eventually arises. To add insult to injury here, what is the government seeking to do? It is seeking to apply the renewal and extension provisions to mining leases that have been validated under the past and perhaps the intermediate period act regimes. As I said, the denial of the right to negotiate in respect of areas which have been upgraded by this government's legislation is the final insult to indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we say that the government is acting in a discriminatory manner. There is no fairness in this provision. There is an ongoing incursion of native title rights&mdash;much more than in the previous subject discussed in this committee, a subject which seemed to attract more interest than this one. I say to those who were concerned about that to have some real concerns for yourselves in respect of this proposal. There is no pressing need for such a further inroad into the rights of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening here is that people are being given rights at the expense of native title holders in a manner which is discrimina 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10371"> tory. For instance, leaseholders under the existing law cannot just expand or extend their leases over private freehold land without negotiating further. Why should these interests be able to extend their leases to perpetual ones? Why should they be able to extend in respect of mining when there are so many new factors to be taken into account? Why should we allow permanent extinguishment in respect of these native title rights? The question to be asked by all of us is this: why should Australian taxpayers be asked to compensate big mining companies and major interests for something which is in no way justifiable and in no way fair? Indigenous Australians are being whacked around the ears consistently by this legislation, but the people who have to pay the compensation claim for those brutal assaults are the taxpayers in the suburbs of Sydney and the taxpayers in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no justification for this. I am glad to see Senator Harradine has proposed some amendments, some of which go close enough to our position that we will support them. Some of them are identical and obviously we will support them. I do say to Senator Harradine that the renewal of mining leases is something of ongoing and critical concern and it does have serious implications.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the present Native Title Act, section 235(7) was a Democrat amendment in 1993. At that time, my colleague the former Senator Sid Spindler spoke in the chamber on this and what he said is worth putting on the record again. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the provisions of the government's amendment, according to our legal advice, made it impossible legally to grant the new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lease. It was therefore thought imperative to rectify this situation. Democrat amendment No. 53 has been arrived at to cure that possible danger. The amendment includes in the `permissible future act' the renewals, re&hyphen;grants and extensions of commercial, agricultural, pastoral or residential leases. This is provided the granting of the lease does not create a proprietary interest where previously the interest had been a non&hyphen;proprietary one and provided that it does not create a larger proprietary interest than was previously created by the lease.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, at the time, Senator Spindler was saying that the renewal will be valid as long as it does not change the nature of the lease. He went on at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the amendment ensures that where the lease contains a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, the renewed, re-granted or extended lease contains the same reservation or condition. This would probably have been the case anyway but the inclusion of that clause, which I am glad to say I took a personal interest in, makes sure of that. I believe that this amendment is important. I commend it to the coalition parties and in particular to those National Party senators who crossed the floor last time. This amendment satisfies a number of interests including those of the Aboriginal people and native titleholders concerned, as well as those of the pastoral industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Although we were rarely given credit for it, what this Democrat amendment in 1993 secured for these leaseholders is that presently, as the law exists today, they are able to renew their existing lease on the same terms and conditions&mdash;and I stress that&mdash;without attracting the right to negotiate. We note especially the support of the National Party in 1993 for this Democrat amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the earlier debates on this bill, I pointed out the almost total abstinence and, indeed, negligence of the coalition in dealing with the 1993 Native Title Bill. I make the point that the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens have not behaved in the same way as the coalition did four years ago. We have moved many amendments; we have worked hard and long; we have certainly not ignored the debate. In that way, I believe that we have certainly participated in a far more constructive way in this particular debate than the coalition did four years ago.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10372">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I note that the crossing of the floor by Senator O'Chee, Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator McGauran in 1993, if my memory serves me correctly, was a notable exception to the delaying and blocking tactics of the then opposition, now the government. Through the course of the present debate, I cannot help wondering whether this amendment bill which we are presently debating is what the coalition, when they were in opposition, might have moved as amendments if they had had a mind to it then. However, we will never know. I have to say that part of the scaremongering that has gone on has included the mythology that leases on existing terms cannot be renewed on the same terms and conditions. This is manifestly inaccurate, as is known by those government senators who crossed the floor when they were in opposition to vote with the Democrats in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these amendments is to reverse the unwarranted expansion of the current renewal provisions. The existing Native Title Act is maintained by reference to a legally enforceable right created before the Native Title Act was brought into being, and a no larger proprietary interest than the original interest. However, the government's proposed amendments expand the current provisions by allowing an upgrade to a perpetual lease and, in some cases, to what is effectively freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will very quickly run through the amendments so that they are on the record. Amendment No. 64 is a minor consequential amendment following amendment No. 65. Amendment No. 65 removes the unnecessary provision and extension of renewals provisions based on an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking, as opposed to a legally enforceable right. Amendment No. 66 removes the extension of the renewals provisions to cover a licence, permit or authority; that is, in addition to covering leases. Amendment No. 67 reverses the extension of the applicable date&mdash;that is, from the proposed Wik decision date of 23 December 1996&mdash;back to the current date of 1 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 68 to 77 are minor consequential amendments. Amendment No. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 78 removes the upgrade to a longer term and removes the upgrade to perpetual leases. Amendment No. 79 is a minor consequential amendment. Amendment No. 80 removes the proposed extension of renewals to allow upgrade to non&hyphen;primary production activity if associated with, or incidental to, primary production. Amendment No. 81 removes the provision which ensures that upgrades to freehold under this subdivision extinguish native title. Amendments Nos 82 and 83 ensure that the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies to all renewals under the subdivision, including upgrades to freehold.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not be looking at larger proprietary interests than exist already. The government's proposals expand the current provisions by allowing an upgrade to a perpetual lease and, in some circumstances, to freehold. This is not anything to do with the native title or concerns about existing provisions. It is a convenient excuse for a number of interests to get, by using the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , something that they have probably wanted to get into land acts.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10373"> als and extensions. I will briefly describe to the committee what these provisions are designed to do. 24IA, future acts, simply makes it clear the type of future acts that the subdivision applies to. They are future acts linked in some way to rights granted in the past. They are pre&hyphen;existing rights based acts such as the exercise of a legal enforceable right giving effect to a past option and renewals which are currently provided for in sections 25 and 23(5) and (7). We are doing this here because, as has been said, renewals are covered in the validation regime in the current act. That is in section 228. They are allowed if they have been validated by the current act but, if they were always valid, then they are only partly covered by the future act regime. So again you get this problem of a distinction between valid acts and validated acts, which we regard as anomalous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">24IB relates to pre&hyphen;existing right based acts. I apologise for the continuation of the most extraordinary language that this act has, but it is necessary to ensure we know what we are talking about. That section provides that certain types of future acts linked in some way to rights granted in the past are valid. First, in the exercise in the future of a legally enforceable right created before 23 December 1996, the right must have been validly granted or validated. That would include a legally enforceable right under a contract to obtain a lease from the Crown. Secondly, in giving effect to an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking made before the date of the Wik decision, the offer must have been made in good faith. It must have been validly made or validated and would include a good faith offer by the Crown to grant a lease. Again, it is to remove the anomalous distinction between validated and valid acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">24IC allows for renewals of existing interests as valid future acts which, as has been said, are currently allowed in part by sections 25 and 23(5) and (7). 24IC would cover renewal, re&hyphen;grant, remaking or extension of a valid, including validated, lease, licence, permit or authority. The original lease needs to have been granted before the date of the Wik decision to itself have been a permissible lease for renewal or to have come within one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the primary production provisions. The renewal of the lease cannot confer a right of exclusive possession, a larger proprietary interest or a proprietary interest where none had existed before the date. Any reservation for Aboriginal people needs to be continued. If the original lease did not allow mining, the renewed lease cannot. But, of course, mining leases can themselves be renewed as is the case under the current act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">24ID sets out the effect of a renewal permitted by subdivision I on native title. The renewal is valid if the renewal allows the grant of a freehold estate or a lease providing exclusive possession. That will extinguish native title but that will only be possible because of a pre&hyphen;existing right based act such as where there is a legal enforceable right granted before 23 December 1996. Other than that limited class, the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies. There can be no extinguishment by the renewal of a pastoral lease or other non&hyphen;exclusive possession lease, and compensation is always payable. I move:</PARA>

I suppose the reason for that is that there have been discussions in respect of this matter and the government has seen the points that I was making. The point I was making about my proposed amendment 13 related to the definition of `pre&hyphen;existing right&hyphen;based act' being extended to included acts giving effect to an undertaking made in good faith but with an erroneous understanding, in hindsight I guess, of the law prior to Wik. Those similar expansive terms appear in the definition of a `past

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine might be satisfied, but I have to say that from our perspective we are not. What our amendments 71 and 72 do&mdash;and they are the ones that Senator Harradine said are covered by his amendment 13&mdash;is focus on something of real concern; that is, the government's proposals extend the renewal provisions to cover offers, commitments, arrangements or undertakings. In many circumstances, they may not be legally enforceable rights. What section 228 relates to are legally binding undertakings, which I think Senator Harradine mentioned&mdash;in fact, I think it is 241 rather than 228&mdash;and what his amendment 13 relates to. What the government seeks to do is import into this a capacity to renew interest based on a feeling that there has been an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go with your amendment, Senator Harradine, you will be allowing a whole new class of interests to be validated where there has been nothing more than maybe an arrangement, one which is not legally enforceable.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10375"> certainty, but it is important also to protect existing native title rights. How nebulous an area are we now going into? If you really want to delve into the depths of uncertainty you say that people have a right to renew an interest on the basis of something that is as loose and fast as an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking. There is no contract involved there. There is no suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you that, although the government may be happy with your amendment 13, if I were the government I would be ecstatic about it because it does not tackle the problem that has been identified here&mdash;a problem which will not only be unfair to indigenous Australians but will ensure another raft of legal cases, another raft of decisions from federal courts and so on.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world heritage values. I am pleased that late last night we received the word that they were to be included on the World Heritage List. Heard and McDonald Islands, as honourable senators would know, are about 4,000 kilometres south&hyphen;west of Perth. They have been listed for both their biological and geological values. Their isolation and inhospitable conditions have meant that no long&hyphen;term human activity or human&hyphen;introduced plants or animals are found on the islands and they are, therefore, almost unique in that regard. The islands also provide a haven for millions of birds and marine animals. In fact, Heard Island is the only place in the world where all six species of Antarctic seals have been recorded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Heard and McDonald Islands have also been listed because of their geological values as they contain unique physical processes, particularly relating to island formation. They are the only sub&hyphen;Antarctic islands where volcanic activity is currently taking place. Indeed, as all quiz masters know, Big Ben on Heard Island is the highest mountain of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Macquarie Island has been nominated because of its unique geological values. It is the only known place where the solid outer shell of the oceanic crust of the planet is exposed above sea level. It is also the site of continuing fault line activity and is therefore an example of ongoing geological processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Macquarie Island nomination was lodged with the full cooperation and support of the Tasmanian government. I have to say how pleasing it is to see that Australian governments, federal and state, are now working cooperatively in these matters; a further signal of a different approach from the Commonwealth government, I might say. I congratulate the Tasmanian government in that regard. We are also working cooperatively with Western Australia in the hope of getting the Bungle Bungles listed, and cooperatively with the New South Wales government in the hope of getting the Blue Mountains listed eventually&mdash;very different from the old trench warfare days of the Labor Party. </PARA>

We had other assistance from groups as diverse as the Wilderness Society. We appreciate it. Finally, I acknowledge the work of my officials, who did a great job.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Paper representatives and members of the Tasmanian Paper Mills Employee Action Committee, the dumping of wood&hyphen;free coated paper has serious implications for the viability of Australia's two mills at Wesley Vale and Burnie and the future of 1,000 direct jobs and 4,000 indirect jobs which underpin the regional economy of north-west Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Customs Service undertook an extensive dumping inquiry, with its investigation focusing on 31 overseas companies, 22 of which were investigated on-site, and 14 Australian companies. Customs has made a preliminary finding that either dumped coated wood&hyphen;free paper did occur during 1996 and that this dumping caused material injury to Australian Paper, Australia's sole producer of coated wood&hyphen;free paper. I understand that the dumping and injury were severe at this time. World prices have risen significantly this year, however, with the incidence of dumping reduced as prices increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs has made a positive dumping finding in relation to exporters from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. Exports from these countries represent 90 per cent of wood&hyphen;free coated paper imports since January 1997. Customs has imposed provisional measures against 14 companies from Austria, Finland, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. The effect of these provisional measures is to impose securities on most exports from these countries where duty may be payable. This means that a benchmark export price has been set for each of the companies named as dumping in the preliminary finding. These companies will effectively export at those prices until the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority has concluded its review and the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs has made a decision on that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs has made negative findings in relation to Sweden and South Africa.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stott Despoja, I think you are wrong to say that the Treasurer was crowing about the national accounts figures. He was, naturally, very proud of those figures, as indeed he should be because they were absolutely sensational. The government is right to be proud of them, and we are proud of them because they are good for Australia and good for Australians. This is the sort of growth which is going to produce the jobs growth we all want and which, I might say, is a No. 1 priority of the government. The results that we received in the national accounts are particularly encouraging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned the composition of the growth in the national accounts. A number of factors underpinned the very strong growth in the September quarter. There were also a number of one&hyphen;off factors. Abstracting from these factors, it is interesting to note that exports grew strongly. There was solid growth in business and dwelling investment. There was, as you indicated, strong growth in private consumption. It is this sort of growth, as I said, which the government has been seeking because it is this growth which will produce the expansion of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You then went on to the tax mix. The government believes that, as we head towards the next century, it is very important to have a taxation system which encourages people to save and to invest, and to help us build the productive base of the economy. It was interesting that Senator Murray, I think, asked me a question in relation to foreign investment. It is true that Australians have come to rely on the savings of foreigners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to lift the level of national savings in this country. I would have thought it was a general consensus position that it is very important that we deal with the massive problem of the savings shortfall which we inherited from the previous government. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10379"> Treasurer indicated that this government believes that it is important to have a taxation system which encourages people to save and to invest.

This government inherited a nursing home sector in serious disrepair&mdash;there is no doubt about that at all. In fact, the standard of nursing home care in relation to many patients was one which most Australians would believe to be inappropriate.

In other words, a very large sum of public money is being put in as a contribution towards nursing care. If the patients are able to contribute something as well, then they should.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have also experienced over many years in my electorate office this problem that Senator Harradine has faced. I am sure many members have. The frustration for older people, in particular, trying to get access to their service and their medical records is quite serious. I have some information here both from Mrs Bishop and Mr Bruce Scott, because it involves two departments. It also involves the Australian Archives, which complicates the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am advised, the medical records of veterans are held either by Australian Archives or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Requests from serving members for service and medical records are generally processed quickly as the member normally has the necessary information&mdash;number, rank and name&mdash;to speedily locate the records. But the processing of requests for personal records from veterans may take, as you said, up to several months. That is determined by the information provided by the veteran and the workload at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The processing of requests for veterans' medical records generally takes longer as veterans' medical records are held by Australian Archives and have to be called for when a request is received. In some cases, a medical record may be held by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in which case the service must request the record from the state office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, this process may take a few days to several months and it is determined by the number of requests received and the staff available in the medical records section of the three services. However, when it is known that a veteran has an urgent need of documents the services will provide that request with a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, has provided me with additional information, that is, that the coalition government has dramatically reduced the average time taken to process veterans' claims through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The average time taken to process all entitlement and assessment claims&mdash;and that includes disability pension claims and war widow pension claims&mdash;has been reduced from 146 days in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1993&hyphen;94 to 77 days in 1996&hyphen;97. It is a reduction of about 50 per cent. I would applaud the improvement, although I recognise&mdash;Senator Harradine has focused attention on this&mdash;the long delays in getting the archival records to the former member or veteran and to the Department of Veterans' Affairs is still an issue which needs further resolution.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3 DECEMBER 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR ALLISON&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services. Minister, in your review of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement it was noted that between $324 million and $917 million is required to need the huge unmet demand for disability services. When will your government meet the needs of 13,500 people in critical need of accommodation, support or respite services? When will your government address the needs of 7,700 people whose carers are over 65? When will your government provide funds for the 70,000 people who need access to day and recreation activities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to Senator Allison's question, I can provide the following information. The Senator refers to the review of the first Commonwealth State Disability Agreement conducted in 1995 and 1996. The Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement is an Agreement between the States and the Commonwealth which sets out the roles and responsibilities of governments in relation to disability services and provides for funding assistance to deliver those services. Under the Agreement, the State and Territory governments have responsibility for accommodation, respite and day services, and the Commonwealth has responsibility for employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States have always had primary responsibility for welfare services for people with disabilities. However, under the Agreement both the Common 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10390"> wealth and the States contribute funds for the provision of disability services. At the start of the first Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement the States contributed around 80% of funding for disability services and the Commonwealth around 20%. The share contributed by the Commonwealth has steadily increased and is now at around&mdash;21.6%</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the review of the first Agreement, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare looked at the demand for disability services. Its report, published in 1996, found considerable unmet demand for services, particularly in the areas of accommodation, respite care and day services, which are managed by State governments. Further work commissioned by the Commonwealth/State and Territory governments this year, will give States better local information on demand for accommodation support and day services and provide more accurate estimates of costs. The results so far indicate that the costs of addressing unmet demand is not as great as originally thought. Latest estimates indicate that the cost of meeting the unmet demand could be about $293 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of ageing carers are an emerging problem for all governments. Work by the Institute showed that in 1993, there were 7,700 parents, 65 years or over, caring for a person with a disability. It is estimated that this figure will rise to 9,000 by the year 2003. Many of these families are looking for the kinds of support which will assure security and certainty about their futures. Clearly, further work is required to examine the exact nature of unmet needs at a local level and how governments might most effectively respond to these.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Agreement is currently under negotiation. The Commonwealth government is keen to work with the States that join in the next Agreement, to examine how the issues facing people with disabilities and their carers can best be addressed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10390"><TITLE>Superannuation Surcharge</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Brien today, relating to a consultancy contract for waterfront reform awarded to ACIL Economics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have the terms of reference provided by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) to ACIL consultants. Point (c) in those terms of reference required ACIL to provide the government with `detailed plans to handle any contingencies which may arise in the implementation of a maritime reform strategy'. Unless the government is prepared to give this parliament details of the plans that have been formulated under that consultancy in relation to any contingencies, this parliament can come to no other conclusion than that the plans provided by ACIL are the basis of the Dubai initiative that is being discussed in the media and that we raised in my question here today. How else can we interpret the government's refusal to release any details of those contingency plans on the basis that personal safety would be put at risk?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point (a) in those terms of reference talks about options which can be pursued by the government to improve the reliability and productivity of the waterfront and to reduce prices. In relation to the consultancies which were revealed at the last estimates&mdash;that is, the consultancies to Dr Webster, Dr Davies, Minter Ellison, Corrs Chamber Westgarth, the National Institute of Labour Studies and others, worth over $481,000&mdash;only two of those reports were provided in relation to the return to order that this centre carried. They were the reports from Corrs Chamber Westgarth and the National Institute of Labour Studies. Both of those reports just happen to refer, I would say fairly directly, to term (a) in the terms of reference in relation to reliability, productivity and reduced prices. They deal with the safety aspects on the waterfront, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10391"> and they deal with the wage relativities of wharfies with regard to their rates of pay compared with those of other workers. The other two terms, (b) and (c), talk about the key recommendations of the Shipping Reform Group in the context of developing a comprehensive maritime reform strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the consultancies, the first ACIL consultancy was for $60,000, which blew out to over $80,000. The second consultancy cost so far is, as far as we know, $283,972. That includes $42,000 to Mark Textor, who is pretty infamous in terms of his association with the Liberal Party, and a consultancy to Jonathon Gaul. They are apparently great experts on the maritime industry. We then have $481,000 in consultancies to Dr Davies and Dr Webster&mdash;both previous Liberal staffers. There is $151,375 so far to Minter Ellison. They are supposed to be reporting on maritime reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at this Dubai exercise, what we do know is that there is an Australian workplace agreement being drafted by someone. What we would like to know is: did Minter Ellison draft that? The government can clearly tell us that by supplying the legal advice that Minter Ellison have prepared, for a sum of $151,000&hyphen;odd so far. The government can also tell us what Dr Davies and Dr Webster have been advising the government on. This really leads us to the potential conclusion that these people are really conduits for government money to fund this sort of exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does the Australian public know that this is not the case? The government says, `This is to supply the government with information, with advice on policy.' Yet we know that they have sought advice on detailed plans to handle any contingencies which may arise in the implementation of maritime reform strategy. Clearly, these sorts of arrangements are being put in place with the engagement of these people to go and learn how to operate on the waterfront in Dubai and then to come back to Australia and operate in the major ports around Australia. What else can these people be being prepared for but a significant exercise which, as every thinking person will know, will be provocative and designed to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promote disharmony, dispute and problems on the Australian waterfront?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in the other place is talking about this being, perhaps, some impetus to reform on the waterfront, but there is a way of achieving reform which is not provocative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can quite understand how the opposition got very excited about today's reports in the newspapers, particularly the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, recognising that there was probably some chance of a terrific political beat&hyphen;up here. It is for them, of course, to traditionally jump to the defence of the waterside workers and their beloved MUA. The truth of the matter is that the government has rejected out of hand any knowledge or any connection with the company involved. More so, the director of the company involved, Fynwest, says that they have a consortium to recruit port workers for wharves in the Pacific region, not Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien, you are not going to listen to that. Like the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), you believe that the waterfront reforms that occurred are sufficient. They have been minute. They have been of no value at all under your government. Why don't you join us in bringing about real and effective reform on the waterfront? The point of the matter is that you are in denial mode. When it comes to the waterfront, you go straight into denial mode, full of conspiracies and full of hope that nothing will ever change. We are determined to bring about real reform on the waterfront. We know where the problem lies. It lies with the opposition and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10392"> their continual defence of the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems on the waterfront are, and always have been, the crane rates, the strike rates, the overmanning, the overpaying and the, at times, outright extortion. When it comes to crane rates, the rural sector, the farming sector and the primary industries sector suffer the most. That flows on to not only jobs but also the wealth of the nation. The wool industry uses more containers than any other export industry in Australia. But wool producers have to contend with hopeless strike rates on the waterfront. They have a delivery time of two weeks, otherwise they pay penalty rates. As if the wool industry has not had enough trouble over the years without being able to get its product off the wharves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listen to this for a strike rate on Australia's waterfront. The level of industrial action on the waterfront is unacceptably high. In 1996 there were 1,250 working days lost per thousand employees compared with an all industry average of 131 per thousand. I repeat that on the waterfront there are 1,250 working days lost per 1,000 employees whereas the all industries average in Australia is 131 per thousand. That is a ratio of one to 10. Australia, with two per cent of the world's shipping trade, has the highest level of industrial unrest with 23 per cent of days lost. We are the worst in the world for strikes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our crane lifting rates per hour are well below that of our competitors. We have a five port average of 18.3. We are competing with equivalent ports which have rates of around 28 to 30. If we could get ours up to 25 containers per hour&mdash;a modest rise close to our competitors&mdash;it would make an enormous difference to efficiencies on the waterfront. That is not too much to ask. Our minister has entered into negotiations, which I do not have any or much hope for, with the union to achieve that benchmark.</PARA></SPEECH>

Today the Prime Minister was again asked whether there was any financial involvement with regard to the government. He was asked to assure the Australian people that there were no government funds involved at all. What did he do? He dodged it. He did not answer the question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How on earth could this outrageous situation come about? I will tell you something: under the Labor Party's industrial relations system, this could not have happened. The reason this is possible is because of Australian

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics figures revealed a provisional five port average of a crane rate of 18.3 containers an hour. That is really something to be proud of, Senator O'Brien, particularly when the bureau conservatively estimates that the five port average could be 25 containers per hour. They estimate that a 43 per cent increase in productivity is achievable. This industry, and in particular the unions, must set themselves some goals for productivity improvements to try to achieve those goals. Not only the bureau but also the government believes that 25 containers per hour is quite achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of safety record, the incidence of fatalities on the waterfront per 10,000 employees is twice that of the mining industry and seven times the national average. The average cost of workers compensation is $1,450 per annum compared with an all industry average of $244. In 1996, the number of days lost, which my colleague Senator McGauran pointed out in his speech earlier, remains almost 10 times the national average.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the issues floating around in this debate? There is waterfront reform. Then there is ongoing industrial relations reform in the maritime industries. There is policy advice via a range of consultancies costing well over $1 million to date. We have a series of former Liberal Party staffers and policy advisers to former premiers and leaders of government. We have a refusal by the government to table documents relating to those consultancies, despite orders of the Senate to do so. We have former soldiers undergoing training in the Middle East in the use of mechanical equipment and they have an expectation of work in four Australian ports&mdash;in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agenda of the current government is quite clear. The Workplace Relations Act, passed with great fanfare less than 12 months ago, is not working as hoped. The current government are unable to address and achieve any worthwhile reform that improves productivity and reduces costs on the waterfront and in the broader maritime industries. Their solution is not one of dialogue, not one of consultation, not one of agreed progress. Instead, what do we hear? What do we know from Senate estimates? They ring up a few old mates. They go through a dubious tender process where government at highest levels invites six or seven firms or individuals to tender to develop strategies for waterfront reform. They allocate hundreds of thousands of dollars over a 12&hyphen;month period to pay for those consultancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the result? The result is the most predictable that anyone with any experience could anticipate. What is the recommendation from those consultancies that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars? What do they say? They say, `Blame the Maritime Union of Australia for all the ills and all the evils on the waterfront.' They say, `Plan to provoke a major strike in key industry. Prepare to dismiss some or all of the current work force in select ports around Australia. Prepare, most importantly, for that outcome by having a contingency plan involving replacement of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10395"> current labour force by ex&hyphen;army personnel recently trained in the use of mechanical and operational equipment on wharves.' They paid for that sound advice to the tune of $600,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of army personnel and their having to go to the Middle East is at least intriguing. Really, when one thinks about it, it is amazing. Once upon a time every tin&hyphen;pot terrorist group in the world would send their recruits to Libya, Iran and Iraq to train as mercenaries and soldiers to blow people up, cause mayhem and hijack planes. What does the Australian government have to say? At best, Minister Reith, speaking yesterday, was reported in today's press as giving a nod and wink to former soldiers to head off to the Middle East to be trained. Trained for what? To operate forklifts and cranes. We have hundreds of firms across Australia that cannot train people to do that sort of work? We have hundreds of firms that are not offering that sort of thing? No, you have to go off to the Middle East to be trained to operate a forklift. What an absurdity!</PARA>

No. It is as quiet as it has been for years and years. We have a peaceful group of workers going about their labour every day and engaging in normal home and community activities.

He permits and encourages $2 companies to hire ex&hyphen;soldiers to train in the Middle East as part of a contingency plan to break the union on the waterfront. What a disgraceful effort that is.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the debate was going along, not that I was not making it up as I was going along, as Senator Bishop falsely claimed. In fact, I was carefully listening to the debate and developing my response on the basis of my own knowledge and not any briefing that had not been given to us by anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this issue highlights is the monumental failure of the previous Labor government to achieve anything with regard to Australia's much needed waterfront reform. They spent millions and millions of dollars when they were in government and gave the retiring wharfies golden handshakes of $100,000 and more.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, $600,000 even, Senator Bishop interjects. Yet all they achieved was a very temporary improvement in the performance of the waterfront, which was soon lost and the performance slipped back to its previous unsatisfactory level. Not only did the waterfront performance, after a year or two of improvement, slip back to its previous level with regard to Australian performance, but it slipped further and further behind other ports across the world, because those ports were continually improving in their performance as we fell further and further behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is that the waterfront is the scene of the greatest workplace rorts in Australia: we have crib time, smokos, ghost employees and all the rest of the workplace rorts evident on the waterfront. When it came to waterfront reform, the previous Labor government was on one long smoko. I well remember the wharfies&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only the overtime rorts. I well remember the wharfie called `judge' because he was always sitting on a case. The wealth and job creation for this country are absolutely dependent on increasing the export sales of goods produced in this country and to achieve that we must be competitive. Australia's waterfront inefficiencies and costs reduce the competitiveness of this country and of our goods on international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10396"> markets significantly. We simply cannot afford the inefficiency in costs of the Australian waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government is doing something about it and it is determined to ensure, Senator Bishop, that waterfront reform occurs, unlike the previous Labor government which achieved absolutely nothing in 13 years in government. Of course, when we set out to achieve reform, apologists for the waterfront unions cry foul. They say, `You cannot make comparisons between Australian ports and some overseas ports because they are larger' or `they have better facilities' or whatever. That certainly is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we want to answer that complaint, let us have a look at a country that we can certainly compare ourselves with in history and culture and every other thing&mdash;New Zealand. Ten years ago New Zealand embarked on significant waterfront reform. At that time, their basic working conditions and the structure of their waterfront was virtually identical with Australia. Their workplace culture was virtually identical with Australia. Yet they set about reform in a dedicated way and now they simply leave us for dead in terms of the efficiency of their ports because they applied themselves in a disciplined way to waterfront reform and we have ignored that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what is now happening is that New Zealand exporters, in particular, but indeed the whole New Zealand economy and the New Zealand people, are benefiting from that greater efficiency on their waterfront. Australia desperately needs that sort of reform on our waterfront. This country, above all, is an exporting nation and if we are going to grow jobs and grow our economy we have to lift the income that we earn from exports. We simply cannot do that with the current level of efficiency in our ports, both in terms of container ports and general ports. We need the reform program in place and we do not need it frustrated by union activity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make this personal explanation because of numerous media reports. I will name one in particular, but there are a number of others. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  newspaper, there is an article by Piers Akerman headed `Hidden gender opens cleavage in sports ranks', where I and a number of my colleagues on the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee are named with regard to a report that we presented to this Senate two days ago. We were also named in a series of articles that appeared in, for example, the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>  yesterday under the heading `Sport may be mixed bag for women.'; yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  under the heading `Boys will be girls in sports events'; yesterday in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  under the heading `Senate committee recommends rights for transsexuals: men in women's sport'; and yesterday in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>  under the heading `Sex swap sport move'. All of the latter named articles were by Matthew Horan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to give this explanation, I have to quote a few facts. I do not have any problem with quoting facts as substance with regard to this. In the tabling statement that I presented to the Senate on Tuesday, I made this very brief statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sport</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report makes no recommendations about sport&mdash;The evidence did not demonstrate that there was much interest in competitive sport by transgender persons and the Committee considers this issue can be dealt with by the relevant sporting organisations on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report itself is over 300 pages long with all the appendices in it. Sport was rated so highly in that 300-page report that it warranted six paragraphs. That is just over one page out of a 300-page report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10397">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not read each and every media article I have mentioned, but the reportage has it that the majority of the committee&mdash;that is, the Labor members of the committee together with the Democrat representatives&mdash;recommended that transsexual persons be allowed to compete in women's sports events. The committee made 33 recommendations. None of those recommendations made any comment whatsoever about transgendered persons participating in competitive sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an 18-month inquiry. The committee heard evidence from a wide range of people. Participation in sport was not one of the big issues in the committee's deliberations, but it was raised by some submissions. For example, Ms Heather Reid, the executive officer from Womensport Australia, who appeared at the Canberra hearings, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Womensport Australia has worked quite closely with the Women and Sport Unit on this particular issue. We would like to basically support the proposed bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">we were investigating a bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the comments and recommendations made by the Women and Sport Unit . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Debbie Simms is the manager of the Women and Sport Unit in the Participation Division of the Australian Sports Commission. She had this to say at that very same hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, I suppose, the commission's point of view is that we support the legislation&mdash;the basic philosophy behind it. We have a few concerns, however, about its relation to sport and specifically to competitive sport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on in a different part of the same paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the competitive sport aspect, there are two points of view and at this stage the Australian Sports Commission feels that we cannot provide advice as to which way this Senate committee should go. We feel basically that some research needs to be conducted before an informed decision can be made.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee heard this evidence and certainly took it into account in developing the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to commend a number of other journalists, including Jody Brough from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and Rebecca Rose from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> newspaper. Ms Brough and Ms Rose did read the report. Unfortunately, Mr Akerman and Mr Horan did not. They did not even take the time to read the tabling statement and the one paragraph in the tabling statement that referred to this issue in this report. There is no recommendation about this issue in the report, and there was never going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened with Mr Horan and Mr Akerman reflects personally on them. Importantly, it reflects on the profession they represent that they should so mislead merely for a sensational headline on this issue, which is a very emotional one, particularly for transgendered persons and their families. I hope that my short explanation here this afternoon will clear the matter. If the journalists named want to check the matter further, I invite them to call me. My extension number is 3416. They can ring me at any time. I always return telephone calls.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

We have been persuaded that there should be a double good faith provision in respect of offers and undertakings et cetera made before 26 December 1996. We think that it is an appropriate amendment, because it is the government's view that these matters should be valid only on the basis that they are done in good faith. It is certainly not the government's intention that there be any way to subvert these provisions. As I said before lunch, they are consistent with the wording used in the current Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since the amendment has been circulated, albeit briefly, I indicate that what we are doing with R79 is adding at the end of subsection (1) of schedule 1 item 9 that the original lease does not create a right to mine.

Certainly no compelling case has been made for renewing leases for longer terms, let alone for making Western Australian pastoral leases perpetual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there is an argument, discussion, going on in Western Australia, but my amendment ensures that pastoralists have certainty and that, with certainty, they can renew their leases on identical terms and conditions as their previous lease without the need to negotiate. That is the point: they can get their renewal on the same conditions without the need to negotiate. I think that it is reasonable, though, that if there are going to be enhanced conditions in the terms and conditions of the renewed lease, then the persons affected, namely, the native title holders, should have some say in the matter. At least they should be consulted and there should be a right to negotiation. Any more than that would, I believe, be an overreach which could be used for long&hyphen;term suppression of surviving native title. That is what concerns me. It would be a bit by bit approach which would have the same long&hyphen;term effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been put to me that perhaps one should support the idea of perpetual lease 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because under the Wik judgment perpetual lease means perpetual coexistence. If you look at the bottom line of Wik, native title rights can coexist with pastoral leaseholders' rights. But, to be serious about the matter, I think the principles of my amendment are desirable, that is to say, if there is to be a renewal let it be on the same terms and conditions or otherwise let those other persons who are affected, like native title holders, have the right to be consulted about the additional terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment 15, section 241C(4)(d)(2) relating to future acts that are permissible lease renewals, allows a diversification of activity. It ought to be a legal requirement and not simply a likely outcome that the majority of the area remain for primary production activities. There would be no problem in policing this particular requirement. If they are pastoral leases, they are pastoral leases. I think it is only fair that there should be a legal requirement for primary production activities to be the majority activity. I understand that is acceptable around the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has no objection to Senator Harradine's amendment 15, but we are not in a position to support amendment 14 which would have the effect of removing the capacity to renew a lease for a longer term than the original lease and renewals, and involves a perpetual lease being granted. There is some misunderstanding in rural circles on this. Longer term or perpetual only goes to the term of the lease; it does not pertain to the rights granted under the lease. The coexistence of rights is a function of the rights granted under the lease and the interrelationship with any surviving native title rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the Commonwealth parliament should not interfere with the states' rights to grant perpetual leases. What we do interfere with, obviously through these provisions, is their capacity to change the rights granted under the lease, and that is part of our package. But when it comes to the term&mdash;which has, as I say, nothing to do with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10405"> rights granted under lease, what can actually be done on the land&mdash;we think that is an undue interference. After all, the provisions would otherwise allow the terms to be renewed on and on anyway. It seems that it makes no difference to allow a perpetual lease and we do think pastoralists who want security of tenure should be entitled to seek a perpetual lease, given that we are not talking about the rights and therefore we are not talking about the interrelationship with any coexisting native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

What I am getting at is: if you get a situation whereby the actual term of the lease is extended to a time or a term beyond that of the original lease, particularly if you are looking at the term being extended in perpetuity, you create an atmosphere, an impression that the rights of the native title holders are thereby diminished.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is supporting an amendment identical to Senator Harradine's. I take this opportunity to put that on the record and also to indicate that one of the problems with this debate has been that we actually address issues in isolation of their overall impact. At this stage, we are talking about a capacity to go from one term to maybe a longer term and even to a perpetual lease. That in itself creates problems because it goes further than the common law. Also, if you were to recognise this capacity to extend into a perpetual arrangement combined with the capacity under the legislation to move from a pastoral lease to a primary production 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lease, the combined impact of both those provisions of this bill will involve, basically, an upgrade to a perpetual, all&hyphen;embracing provision which pastoralists did not have before this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the combined effect is something that we should look at here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, you would probably just retain the size of Tasmania in terms of that map, but I am sure we are not just talking about retaining the right to negotiate for only Tasmania in this debate. We are talking about a particular provision&mdash;division 3, part 2&mdash;which replaces the old right to negotiate provisions with a new regime. As I said, the total effect of the government's provisions would reduce the right to negotiate to apply only to some six to eight per cent of the landmass in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin might say that is meaningless but, as Senator Woodley quite appropriately interjected, the map that has been shown to Australia already suggests that 79 per cent of this country is currently accessible to the right to negotiate. We dispute that figure, but I do not think the government can run away from the fact that, by removing the right to negotiate on pastoral leases, we would be reducing the coverable area enormously&mdash;as I said, to the extent of some six to eight per cent of Australia only. The right to negotiate is important. Native title is meaningless without some mechanism to protect it against arbitrary impairment or disruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party position here is that the right to negotiate should continue to apply. What are we talking about? We are not talking about a right of veto; we are talking about a right that provides protection of native title as well as a fair process for resource development in Australia. The basis of the right is a fair balance of interest between the need to protect native title and the culture that underlies that title, and to provide for compensation and the needs of resource developers. It is restricted in its application to mining&mdash;that includes mining and exploration activity that affects native title&mdash;and to compulsory acquisition of native title for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purposes of granting an interest in land to a non-government party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current focus of our amendments is that the right to negotiate should continue in the context of mining and exploration. There is some confusion as to how it operates. It is straightforward. It is directed by a state or territory government issuing a notice that it intends to deal with land in a section 29 notice. That notice then follows with a requirement for native title holders to register their interests in the land by lodging and satisfying the registrar of the tribunal, or a similar state or territory body, of the bona fides of their claim. There is then provision for a short period for good faith in negotiations&mdash;and I stress good faith in negotiations&mdash;between the native title holders, the resource developers and the relevant government. Then there is a process of independent arbitration. If an agreement is not reached within four months in terms of exploration or six months in terms of mining, then acquisition. Then there is a capacity at that stage for the relevant state minister to override the decision of the arbitrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposals as embodied and reflected by the 1993 legislation are an alternative to the common law. They provide a certain process and they provide certain outcomes. In return for that, they also provide certainty and security for all titles and grants. So what we are saying is that, fundamentally, the right to negotiate process is a fair one. It does balance instruments and it is a basis for development and improvement rather than abolition, as the government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made some fundamental misunderstandings in terms of what it wants to do here. The right to negotiate lies very much at the core of the Native Title Act. It ensures that the NTA conforms with the Racial Discrimination Act and, importantly, the just term requirements of the constitution. The right to negotiate is&mdash;and we should place this on the record&mdash;part of the 1993 Native Title Act package through which indigenous people did give much, the past act regime, for instance. What the government is doing here by its removal of the right to negotiate in these areas is leaving this particu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10408"> lar bill&mdash;if not the act&mdash;open to constitutional challenge and, as a consequence, exposing state and territory land administration to ongoing uncertainty. The other thing is that, if you act in a manner contrary to the convention on the elimination of racial discrimination and the RDA, it does have international ramifications for Australia. This area is one of those areas mentioned by the Chief General Counsel as an area of concern in terms of breaching that convention and the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have concerns with the government's proposal and this is another misunderstanding the government has. The government's proposal goes very much to the question of physical impact. It disregards the cultural nature of native title and the spiritual attachment of native title holders to land. It is based on, we believe, long discredited theories of assimilation. For example, proposed section 43A of the legislation removes, as I said earlier, the right to negotiate from much of the Australian continent. Even for major mining projects where land is subject to a pastoral lease, this government's legislation allows states and territories to replace the right to negotiate procedures with procedures under state mining legislation. Those procedures do not take into account the concept of native title; they take into account a much more limited range of factors. As I said, this is borne out of a real misunderstanding of the concept of Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember when we are approaching this area that indigenous Australians do have alternatives. They got these rights through the common law&mdash;through Mabo and latterly through Wik. The system has to take native title into account. It has not as yet. Two hundred years of non-recognition means that much of our legislation dealing with land has to factor this concept of native title into it. We in this place have to factor in important considerations flowing from the just terms provisions of the constitution, the racist power of the constitution, the RDA and, above all of those legalistic requirements, a sense of morality with which we approach discussion on this issue. If you want uncertainty, then you do what the government is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing. By doing what you are doing, we will finish up back in the court, and we will finish up with some major constitutional problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move to the improvements. Through the debate on this particular legislation we have, in fact, adopted a new registration test and procedures. We have adopted new processes for claims and so on. We have adopted a new regime for registration. I think those new procedures were of importance to an enormous range of stakeholders. Those stakeholders, at the end of the day, can quite reasonably say that they have got out of this process much more than they would have expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, I will talk about how we anticipate the right to negotiate should operate. I will come back later on during the debate to the once-off or twice-available right to negotiate. The right to negotiate in respect of mining can best be demonstrated by greenfield arrangements. Under the Labor Party proposals, with not only the capacity for a one-off right to negotiate but also the capacity to have that right both at exploration and at mining, the following would be the situation. If you are talking about a greenfield operation, an exploration licence would be obtained, in the case of high impact exploration, through a right to negotiate. In the case of low impact exploration, you would find that the expedited procedures are likely to apply. In those circumstances, the right to negotiate is bypassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is important for the right to negotiate to apply to exploration because, quite often, there could be impacts on native title at that stage&mdash;not always, but quite often. We believe that processes provided by the act at the moment&mdash;through which an agreement must be reached within four months in terms of an exploration permit, after which the matter can go to arbitration&mdash;are not unreasonable. In terms of developing a proposal to mine, four months can be factored into long-term arrangements, into arrangements for raising capital and into all sorts of other requirement processes that people have to go through. This should not mean an extra delay. However, what it does mean is that indigenous Australians can have some reasonable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10409"> notice through which they can protect their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposal allows for arbitration. It also allows for conjunctive agreements. Future mining, for instance, can be agreed to under the right to negotiate provisions at the exploration stage or through an ILUA. Of course, this would suit those who have petroleum and diamond projects, which have a high cost, up-front intensive activity level. Later on down the track you do not have any real growth in the activity. These conjunctive arrangements may not be suitable to large and small scale mining. In those circumstances, exploration licences usually cover extensive areas and numbers of native title groups at the start. The mining that then follows is usually over relatively small prospective areas and is unlikely to involve, for instance, all of the groups involved in the exploration agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So with greenfield arrangements, we need to recognise that the capacity to have that right to negotiate at the exploration stage is important. They should not be cumbersome, particularly now that we have new procedures and registration tests in place. With brownfield arrangements, if there is a mining lease, it would be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to the Senate that we are concerned we protect the right to negotiate. We are also concerned that the Senate focus on a capacity for that right to be a bit more flexible than what the government is providing. That flexibility should be able to be triggered at the exploration stage, but such triggering should have the capacity to cover, where the parties agree, the mining stage as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very hard for us to put in place a regime which does not accommodate the exploration stage, particularly when some parts of industry would prefer to have it there and when other parts of industry would like to have it at the other end. It is also hard, particularly when indigenous Australians state quite clearly that it is important for them to have it at the early stages for a number of reasons: firstly, it is necessary to protect heritage sites; and, secondly, fundamental to any mining project, it would give an opportunity at the start of the process to develop a relationship between the miners and indigen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ous Australians. They have to live with each other long after the exploration process. Having that capacity to bring people together at the early stage is quite important.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the start of this debate I would like to make some remarks about the right to negotiate. It is obviously a very sensitive issue, and it is one that is at the top of the political agenda with regard to the question of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key issues that had to be addressed when the Mabo decision was made and legislation was being framed to incorporate native title into our land law system was: what procedural rights should attach to the common law right to native title? Obviously the Mabo judgment was silent on that. It could have been left to the common law. The response could have been not to do anything but to leave it entirely to the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament's approach was to frame the Native Title Act and to take it as the base measuring stick for dealing with native title&mdash;on the presumption that native title could survive on vacant crown land and Aboriginal land&mdash;to equate it to freehold for the purposes of a legislative framework. Therefore, the appropriate procedural rights that would attach to common law native title, prima facie, were then regarded as the rights of freeholders. Whatever procedural rights freeholders had in Australia&mdash;that is, the rest of us who own freehold&mdash;they would attach to common law native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament went one step further and, in a few respects, attached a greater right than would normally attach to freehold and described it as `the right to negotiate'. That was specifically set as a right which would attach to mining on land on which native title may have survived and compulsory acquisitions for third parties. Those were the two things. This extra right, on top of the freehold right, was prescribed by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those facts are important because there is a lot of misunderstanding in the community. I am not accusing anybody of misleading anybody, but there is obviously a misunderstanding in the community about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10410"> what it is, what it applies to and what the nature of it is. It is a statutory right provided in those two circumstances&mdash;mining and compulsory acquisition&mdash;which goes beyond the standard of freehold procedural rights in relation to native title claimants. Of course, it does attach to claimants as well as holders of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read the second reading speech by Mr Keating, it was originally envisaged, and this is set down in the current act, that a mechanism would be found to ensure that, by and large, exploration would be excluded from the right to negotiate. But that has proved unworkable for a variety of reasons involving various court cases. The former government's original intention that, in most circumstances, the right to negotiate would not apply to exploration has not proved true and has not worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that when our government came in&mdash;and I think we picked up on the experience which the previous government had had&mdash;there were, as you would expect, teething problems in the way in which the right to negotiate was operating, essentially flowing from the breakdown in the registration test. It meant that basically anyone could make a claim and anyone could then be party to the right to negotiate process. The whole thing was breaking down badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was certainly put to me very strongly in all the discussions I had that the most critical thing was an effective registration test or otherwise the right to negotiate process could never work properly because of the extraordinary number of competing claims and because an agreement can only be reached if you get everybody to agree. You only need one person to stand out of 18 or 20 separate claims and there is no agreement. Therefore, you are into arbitration or someone goes to court to appeal against the negotiation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say as an aside that the parliament's refusal to accept our registration test is a great pity because this is not going to solve some of the obvious problems that exist for Aboriginal people in the operation of the right to negotiate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well have been, Senator Collins. I am sorry you feel so badly about your former leader, but I thought he spoke honestly about the process in that case. We sat with the Waanyi elders who described to us their heartbreak. The proposition they put to us, which we have not taken up, was that, in the right to negotiate process, you should be able to have a situation where, if a majority of parties can come to an agreement, the agreement should be signed. They said to us that the problem was if you had just one person who refused to participate or join in the process of reaching agreement, the whole thing broke down very badly. We have not adopted that particular proposition put to us by the Waanyi elders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also put to us quite widely that one of the real social issues with the right to negotiate is the fact that it is a procedural right attaching only to native title and not available to any other Australians. People have asked, `Why don't you just do what the parliament originally should have done, and that is say that the procedural rights attaching to native title shall be the procedural rights attaching to freeholders,' which, I think, speaking objectively, would have been a fair approach. We have not done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have retained the right to negotiate for mining and compulsory acquisitions for third parties in most respects on vacant crown land. We are not abolishing or removing the right to negotiate. It remains for Aboriginal land and vacant crown land in relation to mining and compulsory acquisitions for third parties&mdash;its original intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most sensitive issue has been, of course, what do you do now about pastoral leases because, by definition, it was never contemplated by the former government that the right to negotiate process would operate on pastoral leases because the act was never intended to apply on pastoral leases. It was a process envisaged as applying, in relation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10411"> native title claims, to the land on which native title was thought to have survived&mdash;Aboriginal land or vacant crown land; about 37 per cent of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in government then faced a new situation, a situation that did not face the former government: what do you do about the procedural rights attaching to native title claims made over land on which there is a pastoral lease and there is a coexisting title holder? I hope the Senate would treat the government with some respect on the basis that we have approached this matter as one of equity. We have said that the only way we think we can deal with this issue of what procedural rights should attach to native title claimants and holders on pastoral leases is to have equality of procedural right&mdash;that is, that the native title holders should be granted by law the same procedural rights as their coexisting title holder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some, not us, could argue, `Hang on a minute. The High Court said that the pastoral rights are statutory rights and are a superior bundle of rights and prevail over the native title rights. So why this approach?' We have said no. In the two issues in which the right to negotiate is triggered&mdash;that is, mining and compulsory acquisition&mdash;we think the fair, equitable and sensible approach is to say that the appropriate procedural rights to attach to native title claimants and holders are the procedural rights attaching to the pastoral family that have the lease over the land. That means that, when mining or a compulsory acquisition for a third party is proposed on land on which there is a lessee and a coexisting native title holder, they are treated equally. They both join in the process that determines whether or not the development proceeds and on what basis. We think as a matter of fundamental principle that there is no other fair or equitable approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say on this issue that the fact that the native title rights on a pastoral lease cannot, by definition, be the same as native title rights on vacant crown land or Aboriginal land is a matter that we must consider and that the government has considered and has acted accordingly. By definition, native title on Aboriginal land or vacant crown land can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be up to exclusive possession. Therefore, at least the freeholders' rights should attach to activity development on land, but there is this additional right to negotiate which we are essentially leaving on vacant crown land and Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on pastoral lease land the native title rights, by definition, are only what rights survive after you take account of the rights granted to the pastoralist based on the Wik judgment. Any surviving native title rights are subject to the rights of the pastoralists. Therefore, the native title on a pastoral lease cannot amount to the same bundle of rights as it can on vacant crown land or Aboriginal land. Therefore, a different approach to the procedural rights issue is appropriate. On that score of the nature of the native title on a pastoral lease compared with vacant crown land or Aboriginal land and the fact that you have a situation where other Australians are sharing the land, we do believe&mdash;and we do hold this view from the basis of a fundamental philosophical position&mdash;that the procedural rights should be the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that this is the most sensitive issue. We have tried to approach it honestly, fairly and from a position of equity. No doubt later in this debate the government will be abused, hounded and called racist scum, et cetera&mdash;I am saying it for everybody else before they can say it to me. We have tried to approach this very difficult issue from that perspective. We have tried to balance the critical importance to this nation for all Australians and for Aboriginal Australians of a mining industry which we have said  repeatedly in this place offers the greatest hope for development of jobs, income and business skills for Aboriginal Australians living outside our towns and cities. The mining industry is absolutely critical to their opportunities in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have to get this balance between appropriate procedural processes with respect to native title holders and the question of mining and, at the same time, not act in such a way that you are actually deterring that mining activity, which is so important to the future of Aboriginal people. It can generate jobs, security, income and business skills and things that I think are so important for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10412"> long-term security and livelihood of Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you get that balance right? We may never agree on where the balance should be, but I hope the Senate would pay some respect to the fact that we have tried to get the balance right. We do encourage the mining industry to do its utmost to involve Aboriginal people in mining developments. I think it is true that the mining industry has become much more enlightened. Some of the things the mining industry is doing in developing Aboriginal businesses in association with mining developments is tremendous. That has to be encouraged and supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that increasingly mining companies are seeking overseas opportunities for exploration and investment. They are finding the climate in Australia very difficult. The way the right to negotiate process is operating at the moment&mdash;there are enormous backlogs, delays and opportunities to put in place enormous costs in delays in having mining leases granted&mdash;is acting as a considerable disincentive to an industry which, frankly, offers such enormous opportunity for Aboriginal Australians and, of course, is vital to our national welfare and our capacity to look after those in need by generating the jobs and the export income for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the basis of the government's approach to this issue. We do believe that the package we put together on this issue, after much thought, is a fair and sensible one. I have a number of government amendments that I will formally move at a later stage in the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If terra nullius was not a lie, then I guess the use of the word `fair' by the minister, which we have just heard now and on a number of other occasions, would actually have some credibility. The right to negotiate effectively recognises the unique spiritual nature of and provides an essential minimum level of protection for native title. A number of my remarks will actually be sourced from the submission made by the National Indigenous Working Group to the Joint Native Title Committee. I thought they were particularly relevant at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it was agreed in 1993, the right to negotiate deals with resource development and native title by striking a finely tuned balance between the rights and interests of native title holders and those of resource developers. That balance already favours resource developers, governments and pastoralists. There is a minimum level of protection provided by the right to negotiate which takes account of the spiritual relationship between native title holders and their traditional lands. In particular, it provides the basis for the protection of areas and sites of significance, the protection and promotion of indigenous culture and community living, and maintains the ability of native title holders to enjoy and utilise the natural environment. It provides no right of veto over any development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any alteration of the right to negotiate against the interests of native title holders will place it and its processes below the necessary minimum level for the protection of native title. This is a denial of native title holders' substantive equality protected under the Racial Discrimination Act 1995 and the constitution and it is not supported by the races power in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that it is acknowledged there was a trade-off in 1993, the right to negotiate was, if you like, traded off against the so-called certainty of just about every other land holder and land title in the country. Given that is now under threat, that also threatens, as we have heard from a number of learned opinions to the legal and constitutional committee, the constitutional basis of the original 1993 act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to certainty of outcome, in the case of exploration, the right to negotiate provides for certainty of outcome within two months if the expedited procedure applies. There is scope for the current right to negotiate for all parties to resolve any matters subject to the right to negotiate by negotiation prior to an arbitrated outcome. However, should the parties involved fail to agree, the right to negotiate provides for absolute certainty through arbitrated outcomes for exploration in eight months even in the exploration interferes with community life and sacred sites and involves a major disturbance to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10413"> land and waters, with mining and land acquisition for grant to a third party in 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal or diminution of the right to negotiate is such that it no longer contains the minimum level of protection for native title and will create uncertainty by forcing native title holders outside the Native Title Act and into the courts to challenge legislation that impairs or removes native title rights and/or to seek injunctions to protect their common law rights. These litigious, costly and uncertain scenarios are not in the interests of native title holders or governments or resource developers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate deals with the backlog in the determination of the native title. It is as a result of the failure of Australian governments to protect indigenous rights in the past that there is a backlog in the determination of native title throughout the country, such determinations being the prescribed means of acknowledgment of existing common law or native title rights. The right to negotiate addresses this problem in a balanced way by providing for the interests of resource developers and those of as yet undetermined native title holders who can only access the right to negotiate after lodging a claim and passing a reasonable threshold test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expedited procedure is the existing procedure. Activities such as exploration can bypass the right to negotiate through an expedited procedure which removes the right to negotiate if the activity does not directly interfere with community life, areas or sites of particular significance, or involve a major disturbance to any land or waters. In its 1996 review of the Native Title Act, the Industry Commission reported that, due to policy differences between the states, the expedited procedure had only been used extensively in Western Australia, where the procedure had resulted in the grant of 94 per cent of applications for prospecting and exploration licences in minimum time. Other states and territories chose to ignore the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate already favours resource developers because the right to negotiate procedure cannot be used as a veto on resource development. To the contrary, it favours resource development. Quite frequent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly, we have heard in this debate that somehow or other an agreement with a time limit is somehow a veto. Of course, it is not. The time frames for negotiation are unreasonably short for native title holders, particularly as the time used in preparing, lodging and gaining the National Native Title Tribunal's acceptance of the native title application&mdash;two months&mdash;counts against the negotiating period. If native title holders are unable to reach agreement with government and the explorer, miner or developer, the matter can go to arbitration four months after receipt of notice of the government's intention to grant the interest in exploration, and six months after receipt of the notice of mining and the acquisition of native title. As access to the right to negotiate does not arise until the claim is accepted&mdash;probably close to two months after receipt of the notice&mdash;the periods for negotiation are really two and four months respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title holders are effectively forced to accept whatever proposal is put to them in relation to compensation in the negotiation phase, due to the limitations placed on the terms of compensation if the matter is arbitrated. This has been identified by the Commonwealth as a disincentive to constructive right to negotiate negotiations, but this observation has been ignored by the proposed amendments. There is provision for the minister to override the ruling of the arbiter in the national interest, or in the interest of the relevant state or territory. The exclusion of the right to negotiate on pastoral leases is part of the Commonwealth's acknowledgment in 1993 that native title may coexist with the grant of a pastoral lease. It excluded the right to negotiate from the renewal of pastoral leases which are granted on the same terms and conditions as the original pastoral lease. The right to negotiate offers opportunities to shift native title holders from welfare dependence to self&hyphen;reliance. For example, the right to negotiate over mining offers the opportunity to native title holders to negotiate over jobs while providing miners with a local work force in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Negotiations over mining to date have covered such matters as restrictions on em 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10414"> ployees shooting wildlife or disrupting social life in nearby indigenous communities, the protection of sacred sites, job opportunities for local indigenous people, and other benefits in cash and kind. The potential effect of these provisions in operating costs ranges from negligible to the equivalent of a small increase in royalties. What is wrong with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry claims that native title has adversely affected mineral exploration in Australia and we believe that these claims are exaggerated. Exploration continues in Australia at near record levels despite the fact that a high proportion of the country has been explored for surface deposits using modern methods. Largely, the country has been explored in lots of ways. Given that this has occurred, and the government's promotion of offshore exploration, it is only logical that there has been a slight trend for exploration, particularly by multinational companies, to move offshore to countries that remain largely unexplored. It is a matter of falling off the end of the country to a certain extent, in terms of exploration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims that native title has brought about an increase in brown fields exploration can equally be explained by the increasing proportions of middle&hyphen;aged mines in Australia. This factor has provided the economic rationale for exploration in the immediate vicinity of an existing mine in order to extend the life of mine, plant and equipment, and hence the profitability of the initial capital investment which has already been installed. I would like to remind honourable senators here that, from the sourced map that I have produced, 93 per cent of Australia's landmass is actually available for mining claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background, it is clear that the right to negotiate provisions were intended to have at least two areas of operation. In relation to persons whose native title has been subject to determination, the right to negotiate should appropriately be seen as a recognition of the importance to native title holders of the power to control access to and activities on their land. Consistent with this approach, the right to negotiate will not necessarily apply in relation to a future act done in accordance with a registered indigenous land use agree 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. In addition, the right to negotiate reflects a second purpose, namely to permit those who may be native title holders to negotiate the terms of access to land before the opportunity to determine their claims has been fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Indigenous Working Group considered that a proper interpretation of the Racial Discrimination Act convention and the Racial Discrimination Act requires that native title holders be accorded substantive or effective equality rather than formal equality. On the basis of that test, the right to negotiate may be a necessary element of legislation recognising native title, if that legislation is not to be inconsistent with the principles underpinning the Racial Discrimination Act. So I remind the Senate that all this mention of equality by the minister is based on the mistaken doctrine of terra nullius. If, on the other hand, formal equality is sufficient, both elements of the right to negotiate will nevertheless be seen as special measures justified by a past refusal to recognise native title rights and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering whether the right to negotiate, if amended as proposed, would provide substantive equality, the government should test the legislation by a standard of strict scrutiny. In other words, given the absolute inappropriateness of discrimination on the basis of race, the government should not be allowed a wide discretion in determining what protection is necessary for native title holders. Similarly, if the legislation is to be justified as a `special measure', the government has limited room to amend the act, given the historical treatment of native title and given the fact that the Native Title Act itself constitutes a balance between the recognition of native title and the validation of past intrusions upon that title. It is against this background of these principles of racial discrimination that the proposed amendments need to be judged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is excluding the right to negotiate for upgrades to full primary production on pastoral leases. This government is excluding the right to negotiate for off-farm activities connected to full primary production. This government is excluding the right 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10415"> to negotiate when third parties are granted the right to remove forest and quarry for sand, soil and rocks on pastoral leases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is excluding the right to negotiate with regard to certain lease renewals, extensions and upgrades. This government is excluding the right to negotiate in relation to reservations. This government is excluding the right to negotiate in the provision of facilities for services to the public. This government is excluding the right to negotiate for mining exploration, for gold and tin mining, for opal and gem mining, for the renewal of valid mining leases and for the right to negotiate on the intertidal zone. This government is effectively excluding the right to negotiate on pastoral leases and other leased or reserved areas by allowing state and territory bodies to provide cursory alternative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can provide all the sections in the bill, and I am sure that we can circulate them if anyone me wants to. Sadly, quite a few of these rights to negotiate have already been removed by this chamber. Unfortunately, I am not sure whether Senator Harradine has seen the connection between the permissible future act provisions in this bill related to offshore places, mining renewals, reservations and management and the regulation of waters, which he has voted for, and the removal of the right to negotiate, which he has stated that he wishes to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, consideration of subdivision P represents the most serious attack on the right to negotiate. I would like to inform the chamber that we intend to defend the right to negotiate clause by clause. To do otherwise would be to stand by and watch a form of cultural genocide take place, and I am not prepared to do that without putting up a fight.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts said correctly&mdash;I will not go over the same ground again&mdash;the question of what may be on the surface anomalous in terms of common law rights that  Aboriginal people may or may not enjoy on pastoral leases and the rights of the pastoral lessee has been, since 1993, openly conceded as being a trade-off in terms of significant losses, as Aboriginal people see it, in all the other provisions of this legislation that are being considered in the cause of certainty. Validation is an example. There is no question that valuable rights that Aboriginal people may have had under that process are going to be lost. It is being done because, in my view, it would be unreasonable not to do so. This is a trade-off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was ploughing through some old High Court judgments on land tax, of all things. I was fascinated to discover just how long ago the High Court found that the actual conditions of pastoral leases&mdash;in this case, in Queensland&mdash;were not all that brilliant. I found an old High Court case from 1929 known as Clark Tait and Co v Federal Com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10416"> missioner of Land Tax at 43 CLR. Pages 11 and 12 contain the appropriate passages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This case involved whether the Land Tax Commissioner could prospectively levy land tax on a pastoral lease in Queensland rather than retrospectively levy it. The High Court found on appeal that he could not. What was one of the reasons why he could not? I will just quote it. There is some amazing stuff buried in law reports. Every condition known to mankind is buried in law reports somewhere. I will start at page 11:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This refers to the fact that the Land Court's assessment of rent if made after the commencement of the period in respect of which it was made related back to that commencement. A corresponding provision occurs in the lease for crediting the lessees should the Land Court's determination be of a less rent than they have in fact paid. Sec. 43 of the Queensland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lands Act</EMPHASIS>  as now consolidated from 1910 to 1924 provides that every pastoral lease shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) that the lease shall during the term pay an annual rent at the rate for the time being prescribed; (2) that the rent payable for the second and every succeeding period if any shall be determined by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the Land Court. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court's power to determine the rent may be exercised more than once. Under sec. 44 a power of resumption without compensation is preserved in the case of leases of which this is one. The power was exercisable at certain intervals and in respect of maximum proportions of the total area of the land contained in the lease. These provisions, in our opinion, coupled with the provisions of the lease itself show that on any relevant 30th June it could not be known what the future annual payments of rent were, nor what was the future duration of a tenant's right to enjoy any specific part of the land or of his right to enjoy any area of land other than a minimum area unidentified except by the fact that it must be contained in the total area originally granted. It follows from this that the lease does not fall within sec. 28(3) as we have interpreted it.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thus the High Court found in 1929, in respect of a land tax case, that the rights of pastoral lessees in Queensland were so limited that the Land Tax Commissioner could not reasonably legally assess land tax one year ahead because those rights were not certain from one year to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin raised the point that a right to negotiate will involve damage to jobs,

Yesterday, I read into the parliamentary record a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> from a Territorian called Creed Lovegrove.

As a matter of interest, I am told that the map that the Prime Minister flashed around on television was provided to him by the National Farmers Federation, which was given it by the Bureau of Mineral Resources&mdash;at no cost, I am told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the entire debate on this core issue&mdash;and it is the core issue&mdash;of the right to negotiate, the performance by the leader of our country on national television, in which he said that a veto applied under the Native Title Act which would stop development on 78 per cent of Australia, is the most contemptible point the debate has reached so far. It is pretty rich coming from a person who has castigated church leaders in this country and said that they are allowed the right of free speech, but it has to be informed and constructive. Apparently, that applies to everyone except him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cold hard facts are that, despite the fact that almost half of the landmass of the Northern Territory is owned by Aboriginal people, and despite the fact that they have an absolute right of veto that can only be disturbed by federal action&mdash;that is, a declaration of the Governor&hyphen;General in the national interest, which has never been exercised&mdash;not only has the Northern Territory not suffered; it has prospered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We currently have, and have had for a long time, the highest growth rate of any place in Australia. Mining is alive and well and thriving on Aboriginal land. Regrettably, the Mount Todd Gold Mine recently closed down and 250 people were sacked. That was appalling. But did that have anything to do with Aboriginal land rights? No; it was the price of gold that did that. The reason I mention that particular project is that that mine is on Aboriginal land and it was negotiated with the full agreement and cooperation of the Aboriginal people in an agreement which was praised by all sides, including the mining company. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, can I say to you with the greatest respect&mdash;as someone who is coming late to this debate, and you are a reasonable person, I know&mdash;speaking as someone who has been living with this for 30 years, and who listened to the same predictions from you here today as I heard from politicians 20 years ago&mdash;that it was going to be the end of life as we know it in the Northern Territory to exercise a veto over mining&mdash;the facts are that the Territory is doing better now than it has ever done in the past.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I say to you with some confidence that a right to negotiate which falls so far short of a veto it is not funny, which simply gives Aboriginal people, if they can sustain some native title rights in a piece of property&mdash;and it won't be easy&mdash;the right to talk to a mining company for six months, then forces them to arbitration and then, at the end of the day, subjects them to action by a state minister, not a federal minister, who says that the mine can go ahead anyway, is not in my experience likely to damage this country at all.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps of all aspects of native title, the right to negotiate is instrumental. It is note 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worthy that the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  expands the right to negotiate provisions from a little over 10 pages in the current act to a little over 70 pages. This is an illustration of the vast expansion taken up by the detailed provisions limiting the scope of the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the right to negotiate became the prime bargaining element between the Keating Labor government, the Australian Democrats, the Greens, indigenous groups and others when it was conceded that, in return for the validation of the 1975 to 1994 acts, a strong and meaningful right to negotiate would be in place. The right to negotiate is a recognition of the special attachment that indigenous people have to their land. The Native Title Act provides that, for government acts authorising mining and the compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of making a grant to a third party, registered native title holders and claimants will have a right to negotiate for a limited period before such acts can take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate is not a veto. Thank you, Senator Bob Collins, I think you proved that point. It is not a veto, and it was never intended to be. It is merely a mechanism to include indigenous people. I have to say to you: they are Australians, which seems to be a point that is lost to some people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, the essence of native title, and indeed the future act regime in the Native Title Act 1993, is this principle of inclusiveness. It is worth again citing the wisdom of Justice Brennan in the Mabo decision when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Governments of the Australian Colonies and, latterly, the Governments of the Commonwealth, States and Territories have alienated or appropriated to their own purposes most of the land in this country during the last 200 years, the Australian Aboriginal peoples have been substantially dispossessed of their traditional lands. They were dispossessed by the Crown's exercise of its sovereign powers to grant land to whom it chose and to appropriate to itself the beneficial ownership of parcels of land for the Crown's purposes. Aboriginal rights and interests were not stripped away by operation of the common law on first settlement by British colonists, but by the exercise of sovereign authority over land exercised recur 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10419"> rently by governments. To treat the dispossession of the Australian Aborigines as the working out of the Crown's acquisition of ownership of all land on first settlement is contrary to history.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we are not talking about something that happened 209 years ago; it is something that governments have been involved in right up to the present day. And in fact today, 4 December 1997, we are still engaged in the act of taking away native title rights. Justice Brennan further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines were dispossessed of their land parcel by parcel, to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Their dispossession underwrote the development of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think we ought to say that as often as we can. Justice Brennan continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, if this be the consequence in law of colonial settlement, is there any occasion now to overturn the cases which held the Crown to have become the absolute beneficial owner of land when British colonists first settled here? Does it make any difference whether native title failed to survive British colonisation or was subsequently extinguished by government action? In this case, the difference is critical: except for certain transactions next to be mentioned, nothing has been done to extinguish native title in the Murray Islands.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was, of course, the Mabo case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There, the Crown has alienated only part of the land and has not acquired for itself the beneficial ownership of any substantial area. And there may be other areas of Australia where native title has not been extinguished and where an Aboriginal people, maintaining their identity and their customs, are entitled to enjoy their native title. Even if there be no such areas, it is appropriate to identify the events which resulted in the dispossession of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia, in order to dispel the misconception that it is the common law rather than the actions of governments which made many of the indigenous people of this country trespassers on their own land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well said, Justice Brennan. What Justice Brennan has pointed out to us in this excerpt from the Mabo decision is that historically we have excluded indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the validation provisions passing through this place this morning&mdash;that is my reference to the fact that we continue to do what governments have done for 209 years; we did it again today&mdash;this Senate, regrettably with the support of Senator Harradine, has said that between 1 January 1994 and 23 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> December 1996 that exclusion is now fair and just. How can it be? Intermediate period act validation is about further dispossession. It can never be just or fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats affirm our consistent position on the right to negotiate. We see it as being essential to native title and assert that native title, without it, is just window dressing for pseudo&hyphen;reconciliation. In his explanatory memorandum, Senator Harradine says that the right to negotiate is not a native title right. That has certainly been the position of the government. I suggest respectfully that it is a well&hyphen;established point in law that rights which cannot be asserted are not rights at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If native title is going to be meaningful and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;more certain, it will depend on a meaningful right to negotiate. If mining companies think that the right to negotiate makes it difficult to navigate around their developments, then they are in for a very rude shock when they encounter common law injunctions&mdash;once again, rights with enforceability. At common law, the preservation of the subject matter of litigation is well established. Injunctions do not have time limits&mdash;except in so far as they are limited by the courts&mdash;and there are no ministerial overrides either. Mining companies and people who wish to bypass the right to negotiate should be well warned that the alternative is for them much more intrusive that what they presently deal with. That is unless the National Farmers Federation position of extinguishing common law native title claims&mdash;through a sunset clause&mdash;is adopted. That certainly would be poisoning the last waterhole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the government's position is to water down and emasculate the right to negotiate. The Democrats-Greens amendments aim to restore the coverage of the current right to negotiate and improve its facilitation. The amendments will also tighten up requirements for ministerial approval of state&hyphen;territory exploration schemes. I commend the amendments to the Senate that will be moved on behalf of the National Indigenous Working Group. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It is a statutory right achieved as a consequence of&mdash;as those of us who were there would know&mdash;negotiations on the Native Title Bill in 1993. The right to negotiate applies to development proposals of future acts such as mining activities that may affect native title, and to the compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of granting an interest in land to a non&hyphen;government party. The right to negotiate is intended to protect native title wherever it exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I earlier quoted the National Indigenous Working Group as rightly pointing out that `the recognition of native title is meaningless without some mechanism to protect it against arbitrary impairment or destruction.' The right to negotiate on pastoral leases is very significant for Aboriginal people because of the vast land areas involved and their continuing association and attachment to that land. In the past they have been excluded from having much say at all in what happens to that land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title has been recognised as a common law right. It is title based on prior possession and ownership. It is not just another leasehold. It therefore follows that to treat Aboriginal people as equivalent to miners or pastoralists is to effectively downgrade them and their property rights. If a right to negotiate with a mining company is to be enjoyed by native title holders whose country is vacant crown land, that right should not be taken away from native title holders who suffer the added disadvantage of having their land subject to a pastoral lease without their consent. I ask the government to look at it from that point of view, that justice point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth parliament is required to set an appropriate bottom line for relationships between native title holders and miners. It is a matter for the states to determine the relationship between miners and pastoral leaseholders. We cannot do that. We have not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> got the power to do that. The right to negotiate encourages Aborigines and miners to talk together and to work together from the beginning. I know that the government is saying, `All right, they should have the same rights as pastoral leaseholders when it comes to negotiating with mining companies.' Clearly that is a furphy, as I indicated before, because the native title holders have the right to negotiate when it comes to mining on crown land. But you are suggesting that they be denied a similar right when it is on a pastoral lease; a pastoral lease which has been granted without their consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you say there is one set of rights, it is up to the states to deal with the matter in relation to the rights of pastoral leaseholders. The Commonwealth parliament has no power to make laws for the rights exercisable by pastoral lessees under state titles. The veto, negotiation and compensation rights of farmers affected by mining is, I repeat, a state matter. It is not for us to deal with, so why make the comparison? For example, some farmers in Western Australia whose lands are cultivated and enclosed have a veto on mining development. At the other end of the scale are those pastoralists who have only a right to compensation for disturbance to the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has the power and the responsibility to set the bottom line for the relationships between native title holders and miners, and we should do so. In fact, we have done so. Justice Woodward, in his 1974 royal commission report on Aboriginal land rights, considered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of all the questions I had to consider, that of mineral rights has probably caused me the most difficulty and concern.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that to deny aborigines the right to prevent mining on their land is to deny the reality of their land rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, in the Native Title Act we are not talking about veto, but bear in mind what Justice Woodward said. He reached his conclusion after setting out the mining industry's submission in some detail:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because while accepting many of the points made, I am unable to accept the main result contended for. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10421">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do believe that there has been a shift in the mining viewpoint and policy since that particular submission was made to the Woodward inquiry; a shift for the better, I might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the key Woodward recommendation on the control of mining, the Native Title Act 1993 grants only a twofold right to negotiate at the exploration and development stages. If after six months native title holders do not reach agreement with the miner, there is recourse to independent arbitration. Should the arbitral body agree with the Aboriginal demand that mining not proceed, the state minister has the power to override that decision. The government's own explanatory memorandum for the amendment bill is clear. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to negotiate was not a veto.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 proposes to cut back the right to negotiate to a once&hyphen;only right. It also proposes to allow state parliaments to take away the right completely, provided only that the native title holders have the same right in relation to mining as the holder of any state title on the same land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, as has been indicated, the crunch issue. As far as I am concerned, my amendments, as honourable senators would have seen them, uphold the right of native title holders to negotiate. It is, I believe, an extremely important matter. I intend to protect the rights of native title holders in that regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It surprised me that the two Nicks from South Australia, if I can put it that way, have conducted this debate very pleasantly, to the amazement of many people. I think Senator Minchin put the case against the extension of the right to negotiate lucidly. He is correct in saying that the right to negotiate in this particular context is a procedural right and that that procedural right is not available to other people with interests in freeholder land, for example. Any action has available to it the right to negotiate and the success any party to that negotiation is going to have will depend upon the strength of his rights. You cannot negotiate if you do not have a right or the colour of a right, and the less colour you have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the right, the less chance you have of success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those cases where you get an offer and knock it back, and then the jury says no, are very sobering experiences. The right to negotiate, being a procedural right, is not a right over the land. It is not as if we&mdash;if we legislate here today&mdash;are going to give the indigenous people a right that they did not have; what we are talking about is procedure. That is important to understand. Various speakers around the chamber have said that. I want to make it clear that negotiation is not, as it were, going to get you anywhere unless you have a right to negotiate. If your opponent offers you anything, it is because your opponent considers you have a right in that offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning the procedural business of the right to negotiate, it was said that a freeholder has not got the right to negotiate in the sense that it is set out here procedurally in the act. On the other hand, a freeholder has available to him, her or it a procedure that is not available to the native title holder. It is not available to the native title holder because of the doctrine of terra nullius. If I could explain it: possession of land in Australia is proved either by a Torrens system&mdash;which was developed in the minister's state where the title to your land is lodged in an office and that title proves that you do or do not hold the land&mdash;or there is a general law title which means you have to show a chain. In each case, the person who holds those titles has had a chance to build up that evidence over 200 years in Australia; whereas the doctrine of terra nullius has denied the native title holder the evidence that is available to the freeholder or, for that matter, to the leaseholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The doctrine of terra nullius is a very big disadvantage that has been visited upon indigenous people in Australia. We ignored their rights and now we say, `You prove those rights.' Had those who settled Australia and those of our forebears who worked out the Torrens system understood that native title existed, they could have put those rights on the title there and then. Then we would not have had the need to now go through these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10422"> threshold tests. When we say that this is a procedural right which other land&hyphen;holders might not have, the other land&hyphen;holders have a big advantage over native title holders because over that period of 200 years they have had time to build up documentation which proves their title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Margetts said that, when you are looking at whether or not there is inequality between the groups, you do not look at each discrete right; you look at the general bundle of rights and see whether they measure off in an equal way. If you take into account the fact that you have had the Torrens system or the general law system that has enabled people to prove their title to land simply by producing a document, and measure that against what a native title claimant has to go through&mdash;and we have been through that over the last couple of days&mdash;there is a very big difference. So the leaseholder or the freehold titleholder simply produces the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title holder has to go through all the hoops that we presented to him or her in this legislation. That having been the position, I think it is incorrect and unfair to say that we will ignore all that&mdash;we will ignore the different procedures you have to go through to get to the point of proof&mdash;and simply say, `Look, you, the native title holder, have a procedural advantage over a non&hyphen;native title holder on this particular land.' As we often do here&mdash;and as people often do&mdash;that measures fairness in a particular compass: `Give a narrow range to what we are going to be fair about, instead of the broader range of issues that we should take into account.' If we take into account that system of proof, then the right to negotiate can be seen as an evener&hyphen;up to that process and it becomes a much fairer system than some people present it. I think that system ought to be available to all the land over which a native title claimant might make a claim.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the crucial issues that face the debate today. It impacts on mining and on the pastoral industry. It is something that has concerned me for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some time. In 1993, we were told that there was no native title on pastoral leases. The Wik decision altered that and we now have to come to terms with that and provide some sort of legislation that is going to drive Australia forward and provide jobs. I listened very carefully to Senator Bob Collins, for whom I have a high regard, and he seemed to be saying that everything goes well up in the Northern Territory and that there are no delays on native title land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1976, only two new mines have opened through normal processes&mdash;one was in the Tanami Desert. The veto provisions are used often to delay negotiations for mineral applications. Exploration permits on non-Aboriginal land are six times greater than Aboriginal land over a period. Both Mount Todd and McArthur River had to have special legislation under the Keating government to get those mines off the ground. So one could say that mining where the Aboriginal people have a total veto in the Northern Territory is not as rosy a picture as Senator Collins made out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to have a look at how the act has performed since we put it together in 1993. No negotiations have been completed in Australia within a statutory time period. Numerous, multiple, overlapping claims&mdash;up to 18 in some mining applications&mdash;hinder negotiations. Only two mining title applications have reached the determination process, both after years of negotiation, and both have been appealed to the Federal Court and returned to the tribunal and remain unresolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly 2,000 mining title applications remain queued up in the statutory rights negotiation process for nearly three years, and only 158 voluntary agreements have cleared for grant in Western Australia, resulting in 48 actual projects. This compares with between 600 and 800 mining leases granted each year in Western Australia alone before the Native Title Act.

The trend emphasises a major concern for the future of the industry and Australia because of the issues. I will just go through some of the numbers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The positive investment in figures that Senator Woodley brought forward today recognises that the areas of exploration that have been carried out in the previous 10 to 15 years are actually sites that have been under exploration and have been worked up, and they were there prior to the 1993 act. But the expenditure going overseas by Australian companies has increased. The Minerals Council's figures have shown that Australian companies going overseas have grown twice as fast as within Australia from 1993 to 1996. So they are spending twice as much money overseas to explore. The exploration expenditure on production leases on existing operations increased compared to new developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So everyone is concentrating on spending their money on their worked up leases, and they are going for where their leases have been found and where their leases have been granted, but their expenditure into exploration is very much down. It is costing 20 per cent of the exploration budget just to gain access. It cost $200 million last year to gain access. That is the real picture of what is happening to mining in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the risk of provoking Senator Collins, and I will try not to, there are many jobs that are provided to Aboriginal people in the mining industry. In fact, my experience in the mining industry is that they really want to

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come to the problem that does face primary industry inasmuch as the negotiation process is concerned. Throughout Australia there has been a natural progression. Firstly, the Kidmans and the Tysons owned the leases, those leases were cut back to big leases and then those leases were cut back to what was considered livable areas. From those livable areas, farms developed. They were cut off into sugar growing areas or into wine growing areas, but they were excised off pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process of negotiation has to happen every time a farmer wants to upgrade his lease, grow a different product or go from a pastoral lease to growing wine grapes, sugarcane or wheat. Every time he has to go through a negotiation process with an Aboriginal native title claimant, it slows the process right down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to point out some of the jobs that have been provided. For example, our wine industry has gone from virtually nothing to $800 million in the last 15 years, and much of that land would be on pastoral leases. I have an example at the back of Ayr&hyphen;Home Hill where pastoral leases have been cut into 400&hyphen;acre sugarcane farms. Once they raised 30 or 40 head of cattle on 400 acres of land; that same 400 acres of land is now producing 12,000 tonnes of sugarcane and that is providing many jobs right throughout the process&mdash;in the sugar industry, the refining industry and the cartage industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If at every stage a farmer has to go to the right to negotiate before he can move into some other area, it is going to slow our primary production right down. This has already been shown in the western leases of New South Wales where many of them are going into different crops like cotton, which is a very high earning commodity in Australia. But if they are stymied every time by a long, protracted negotiating process where compensation has to be paid to native title claimants or holders, that is going to slow the whole economy down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened very carefully to Senator Harradine and I have never doubted his integrity or his motives&mdash;no&hyphen;one can do that; he is a man who has stood up for his principles and paid a very high price for them from time to time&mdash;but I am concerned because I know Senator Harradine shares the same concerns for blue-collar workers as I do. I instance Golden Circle Cannery that produces pineapples for Australian export. We have this big bank of land out there which is basically held in pastoral leases and, if those sugar farms or pineapple farms cannot be excised, we will not have any downstream processing. The largest employer of blue-collar workers in Brisbane is the Golden Circle Cannery. They employ something like 1,300 to 1,500 people in season. They provide many jobs in the downstream food processing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our manufacturing sector in Australia has been very much downgraded. We only have to get off a plane at Mascot and go through Alexandria into Sydney to see the many factories that have been pulled down for housing, indoor cricket pitches and all those sorts of things. Once those factories provided jobs for many people, but now they are not there any longer. The jobs will be in the downstream mining process and the downstream food processing industry. If people cannot move with the times&mdash;if they are going to be frozen in agriculture in 1997 and in 30 to 50 years time they are not going to be able to upgrade their lease and move from growing cattle to growing sugar, cotton or pineapples&mdash;then we are not going to advance as a nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important debate that we are engaged in. One only has to fly across the centre or north of Australia and see the mineral exploration on the land to know that it does have a very real impact on the form and nature of the landscape. The first thing to be said about the government's position here is that it would exclude Aboriginal people from a right to negotiate on that impact on the land. If you can see the impact it has from that great height as you fly across the country, then you can feel it to a great degree when you are living with the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to respond to Senator Boswell's comment, which I know was a heartfelt one, by creating a picture. I would imagine that an Aboriginal person who has a time&hyphen;honoured link to the land, which includes freehold pastoral holdings, would see things vastly differently. What the government is saying here is that the leasehold land that is involved can be changed enormously in the future, and the Aboriginal people have no say. In other words, `This is the land of your past, but not your future, particularly as far as your cultural and traditional and spiritual connection is concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give an example. Under this legislation, as the government would have it, you may have a vast leaseholding which is for the purpose of cattle grazing. Aboriginal people have coexisted there for a long period of time; that is, throughout the total duration of that lease and that cattle grazing and for a long time before that. Under this legislation, the leaseholder will be able to change up to half of that leasehold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell mentioned cotton growing. I will use that as an example. If they put down some half of it to cotton growing, the Aboriginal people will have no right to negotiate on that. That is the government's intention. If cotton is to be grown, the land 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will need to be cleared and prepared first. They can do that. The savanna woodlands can be logged, if necessary, and the native vegetation can be cleared. It can be woodchipped, if that is what they want. Half of this vast leaseholding upon which the Aboriginal people live&mdash;they have traditional movement and spiritual attachment to it&mdash;can be cut down. They have no right to negotiate under the government's formula. It is their time&hyphen;honoured land, their universe, but they will have no right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cotton crops need a lot of water. If the local stream is required to be dammed for the purposes of irrigation&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that it is a stream where the fishing is good and there is special significance, including spiritual significance, to not only the current traditional owners but also their ancestors&mdash;that can be done, but the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have no right to negotiate. That is the government's prescription. If to get the water from the stream to this vast new cotton crop&mdash;which essentially extinguishes all the traditional activities of the Aboriginal people&mdash;there needs to be a canal built and, for the process of that, there needs to be large amounts of soil dug up off the other part of the property, that can go ahead. Under the government's formula, the Aboriginal people will have no right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other half of the land, the miners might come along and want to mine. It might involve the foreshore, say the leaseholding on the gulf. The traditional owners move to and fro in the intertidal area and use the beaches, but mineral exploration&mdash;say for mineral sands&mdash;requires major changes to the topography. There will be other laws that have to be considered here, but the traditional owners have no right to negotiate about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us say that the mineral product needs to be exported and a jetty or a breakwater needs to be run out into the ocean. In the components of this legislation already passed here today, because we are now talking about offshore areas, the traditional owners have no right to negotiate. The traditional owners may have a cultural attachment as far as the seas are concerned. Moreover, they may depend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10426"> upon in part, or whole, on the largess of the ocean so that they can exist. If a fishing licence is offered to some corporation that wants to move in and reap the harvest for profit of that area, then the traditional owners will have no right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can go on and on, but the point that has to be made here is this is de facto extinguishment. Sure you have the theory of a continuing ability for the traditional owners to enjoy the land, as they did in the past, but this is an erosion of future rights and that access with not even a say. Everybody in here has said, and I agree with them, that negotiating rights are not veto rights. So we have established that. The traditional owners cannot stop what is happening, but here is the government saying that the traditional owners cannot even have an input into what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that is consonant with the Racial Discrimination Act, for starters. I doubt very much that it is even consistent with the constitution because I think it derogates very much from the interests and benefits and rights of the traditional owners of this country. Yes, we are at the heart of the matter; yes, we are at bucket loads of extinguishment; yes, we are at taking away from the traditional owners; and yes, we are going to affect that for decades, for centuries, for millennia to come unless there is some rectification in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other interests here, and they have to be taken into account. But the loudest and strongest argument I have heard is that those other interests have to slow down. We cannot slow down the rights of miners or pastoral corporations to allow the Aboriginal people, far short of a veto, to have a say. That is what we are down to here. Once again, I feel ashamed that we should have a government which has brought this legislation into this parliament. I have no doubt that the majority of Australians would likewise feel ashamed if they knew the sting for Aboriginal and traditional owners in this country that is involved in what is being put before this committee at the moment and what sailed through the House of Representatives because the government has the numbers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Greens and Democrats have strong amendments to stand up to this. What we should be looking at, if you ask me, is an expansion, not a diminution, of the rights of traditional owners to somewhere back&mdash;you cannot go all the way back because you cannot turn back history&mdash;to the full and untrammelled rights they once had. Short of that, we have to find a middle ground, but the middle ground is not to take away everything in terms of the real interest of the indigenous people. What the government is doing here is taking away everything. Sure, the substance of existence is left, but the heart and the ability to affect what happens to their land&mdash;that spiritual attachment, as well as the physical connection with the land&mdash;will be serially eroded forever into the future if this right to negotiate is knocked out, as the government would have it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be standing strongly by the Greens&hyphen;Democrats amendments. We are going to vote against the government's measures. I have heard with some pleasure what the opposition and Senator Harradine have had to say in this section. It has been a constructive recognition at least that we are dealing with the very real interests of the indigenous people and their right to have a say. I am sad it is not much stronger. I am sad we cannot do something to turn around the erosion of their rights in the past, but I am not going to be party to the interminable and creeping erosion of the rights of all future generations of traditional Australians right across this country which is involved in what the government has brought before this Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to standing order 81 Senator Woodley, by letter dated 4 December 1997, has raised a matter of privilege and asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee in accordance with that standing order. The matter he raises is the suggestion that the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission may have misled a Senate select committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter was raised in correspondence I had with the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and which I tabled in the Senate on 25 August 1997. That committee made a request that the Senate investigate the matter. The committee indicated that its attempts to investigate the matter itself were frustrated because the evidence in question was the subject of federal parliamentary privilege and therefore could not be investigated by a state parliamentary committee. The Criminal Justice Commission declined to answer questions on this basis. I indicated when I tabled the correspondence that it was for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate to consider whether it should accede to the request of the Queensland committee to investigate the matter. Since that time, no action has been taken by any senator to initiate an inquiry by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley indicates that he is now seeking the concurrence of the Senate for a Privileges Committee investigation because he believes that additional evidence has come to light in recent weeks. I am required to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have precedence, having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past presidential determinations have indicated that allegations that false or misleading evidence has been given to a Senate committee are always regarded as very serious matters and as meeting criterion (a). In this case, statements to a Senate committee are alleged to conflict with statements made elsewhere and other available information. The statements in question were made in response to questions put in the course of proceedings of the Senate select committee. Only the Senate can investigate the truth of those statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider that the matter clearly meets the criteria I am required to consider. I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence. It is for the Senate to determine whether the Privileges Committee should inquire into the matter. I table correspondence from Senator Woodley. Senator Woodley may now give a notice of motion. If it transpires that this is the last day of sitting of the Senate in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would concur with the need for us to change the hours so that we can carry this debate to a better state of completion before the end of the day. However, twice yesterday, when I rose to ask a question in this place, I was refused leave by members of the government. The second time that refusal was by the National Party whip. I do not intend to delay the Senate greatly tonight because I recognise that there are more people than those who refused me leave yesterday who want to get on with it. But I do want to make a few comments about the outcome of that incident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to abuse power in this place. That is not what the forms of the Senate are about. They are about giving everybody a fair and an equal go. I have never seen anybody refused leave to ask a question, although that form is unusual, in my 12 years in parliament. I think it is a very serious matter when a senator is refused the opportunity to ask a question, on this occasion of a chair of a Senate committee about a report which had just appeared before the Senate. It is tantamount to removing a senator's opportunity to gain information. On this occasion it was also effectively a mechanism for not allowing the chair of that committee to respond to my request, which was to do with the deliberations of the committee into the matter of sexuality discrimination.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was most regrettable behaviour by Senator O'Chee and other senators that they used that mechanism to prevent me from having a say. We, that is, the Greens, the Democrats and the Independents in here, have to rely on the forms of this place to ensure that we are not shut out. I want to inform government senators that those forms are very powerful. They have been developed over a long period of time and they are to ensure that senators, elected by voters who have every right to see their senators here, get a say and are not silenced by the sort of behaviour that we saw yesterday. The outcome of refusing me the opportunity to ask a question is simply an unnecessary delay. It has come from those few senators on the other side and not from me. I would not be responding in this way otherwise. So there is an end to the matter. I have now had an opportunity to speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using other methods, we have heard from the chair of the committee, Senator McKiernan, earlier in the day. But I want to put on notice Senator O'Chee and others that, if they wish to use and, I think, abuse the procedures of the Senate, I will not just accept it. That is not what I am here for. I will use the procedures of this place fairly and with good will, but if they are going to be abused in the way they were yesterday, then I will respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank those senators who have been supportive in this matter. That is very encouraging. I think it is a pity that the people who abused the forms of the procedure yesterday did not seek wiser counsel. That having been said, I, like everybody else, want to see us get back to the matter of substance and carry on with the debate. I thank the Senate for its forbearance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put a question to the mover of these amendments, Senator Bolkus. Are you attempting here to in fact retain the situation as it is in effect in the Native Title Act when it comes to the right to negotiate at the exploration stage? I understand the argument that is being used. That is, very often, if that right to negotiate at that stage is availed of, then the relationships between the native title holders and the miners are in fact enhanced if the exploration stage is successful, particularly when it comes to negotiating on the second stage, that is to say, at the development stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the government's view is that there should be only one occasion when there could be a right to negotiate. But I am now convinced, heaving heard the discussion, having read a little bit more about the matter, that it would be desirable to maintain what is currently the situation under the NTA. If that is the purpose of these amendments, I would be supporting them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks on this matter. I am resisting the temptation to debate every amendment, but I do think it is important to state that the full&hyphen;blown right to negotiate process is, generally speaking, inappropriate for exploration per se. That was recognised by the Keating government. They had a mechanism by which exploration could be excluded from the right to negotiate. Indeed, Mr Keating, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, classes of grants can be excluded from the negotiation process altogether where they would have minimal effect on any native title. Certain prospecting and exploration permits would be likely to fall within this category.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It clearly was contemplated then that the right to negotiate process simply would not work with the thousands upon thousands of exploration titles issued very year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that about one in a hundred of every exploration licences issued in the country results in a mine, so there is nothing in that sense to negotiate about in terms of jobs and benefits to Aboriginal people. We have approached this from the other end saying, `Why don't we put in place a sensible procedure for dealing with exploration per se so that the matters affecting native title in respect of exploration are dealt with on their merits in a particular procedure?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exploration is so different from the question of a full&hyphen;scale multimillion dollar mine. As I said the other day in this chamber, exploration in many respects amounts to the 84&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Jack Otways of the world, exploring on their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10442"> own with no money and no resources over a five&hyphen;hectare lease area. The right to negotiate as applied to them means, in the case of Jack Otway, receiving a 70&hyphen;page list of demands from some lawyers in another capital city. Mr Keating recognised this was not going to work for the thousands upon thousands of exploration leases issued every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put together in 26A what we believe is a very good mechanism for ensuring that a proper procedure is put in place to deal with exploration permits. It is workable and deals with issues that should be dealt with at the exploration stage. To approve a process for exploration, the minister has to be satisfied that there is a right to be notified that the act is to be done; that such persons or bodies will have a right to be heard by an independent person or body about whether the act is to be done and about any matter relating to the doing of the act; that there will be a legal obligation to consult appropriately any person or body covered; that procedures will be in place under which such consultation will be required for the purpose of minimising the impact of the act; that any area or site of particular significance to the persons holding the native title will be protected; and that there is access to the land or waters which the native title rights and interests relate to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone to great lengths to ensure that the issues that really need to be dealt with at the exploration stage are dealt with in a purpose&hyphen;built procedural mechanism. That is a much more appropriate way to deal with exploration which is very different from a Roxby Downs mine or something like that. It often involves ordinary single Australians out there exploring, seeing what they can find. As I say, the success rate, the strike rate, is about one in 100. We would be disappointed if the Senate would not recognise the benefit and the attraction of what we have put together here in terms of a proper procedure for dealing with exploration on land on which native title may have survived. We think it is a much more sensible and productive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, because of the way in which the right to negotiate process is structured, it does not, in fact, apply to exploration. Exploration licences are being issued 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> without a proper mechanism and without regard to native title issues because of the huge volume of things we are dealing with and the incapacity of the right to negotiate process to handle that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in practice, the right to negotiate protections are not working for the issue of exploration. That is the reason you get these high statistics in relation to exploration not being caught up in the right to negotiate&mdash;there is not any way of dealing with it. This is a much more satisfactory procedure, which the states are supporting. It makes a lot of sense to adopt it and I commend it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Minchin's concerns, but it should be  stated that the existing 237 provisions of the act, the expedited procedures provisions, in fact have accommodated some 80 per cent of applications for explorations which have been determined over the last 2&half; years. That is an important statistic to keep on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, exploration can be a non&hyphen;intrusive thing but it can go from surface sampling to seismic surveys, to digging pits, trenches, holes, bores and tunnels. It can be quite invasive. It can divert water from springs and so on. It can take a fair degree of sampling and testing. We say that there needs to be a degree of flexibility, especially also when you include quarrying which would have a substantially greater effect as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current arrangements do provide an expedited procedure which has been used, as I say, in something like 80 per cent of concluded cases. Industry also, it should be acknowledged, wants some degree of flexibility, especially diamond and petroleum exporters. Also, I cannot imagine rep bodies wasting their time on this particular stage of the process, unless there is a real need to do so. The evidence of the operation of the act so far would indicate that they have kept out, unless there have been some impacts that are of concern.</PARA>

The fact is that under the expedited procedure you get basically no rights. So there is no flexibility because it is either the right to negotiate, which most people agree is simply inappropriate for exploration, or the expedited procedure, where you get no rights at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to remind the minister that there are considerable impacts on land through exploration. The mining industry likes to talk about satellite surveys and non&hyphen;intrusive means of exploration but, as I said earlier, one only has to fly across Central Australia to see the enormously pervasive mineral exploration lines that have been cut and roads that have been put through vast areas in the name of exploration to see that there is a huge impact on the country from traditional exploration methods. When you are on the ground, this impact is very considerable in terms of the traditional owners and their relationship with the land. It cannot be dismissed as not being a matter of significance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exploration very often involves vehicles, the movement of numbers of people and exploration camps and a very big change to the nature of country and small isolated populations and their culture and environment. It cannot be dismissed as not being of significance. There needs to be an opportunity for people to negotiate about the impact of exploration, if it is to take place. The point of difference between the government and us on this matter is not whether exploration should take place; it is about the negotiated terms which lead to exploration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is debate in here about whether the exploration is in some way or other slowed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down or diminished because of the right to negotiate but the reality is that the right to negotiate of traditional owners should not be expunged simply to enable schedules to be kept by exploration entities. We are not just talking about an explorer here and an explorer there. We have already heard today about some 18,000 to 20,000 leases for mining being issued over the last three years or so. So it is a very active and, for localities which have not seen the intrusion of mining camps, a potentially very intrusive matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people ought to have a right to negotiate. They ought be able to negotiate on the basis of information. You also have to be aware that exploration is not done for the heck of it; it has the intention of mining to follow. Right at the outset there ought to be the opportunity for indigenous people to be fully informed, to be aware of the impact of exploration and mining and to be able to negotiate at both critical stages, minimum, remembering that they have no right of veto, but that they have the right to negotiate because it is their world, it is their life, it is their culture, it is their attachment to the land, and that is infringed by both exploration and by mining.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Brown has read 26A which acknowledges all of that and which says that approved exploration acts can only be determined if all the conditions set down there in 26A are met and they involve the requirements that there be a right of notification, a right to be heard, a right to be consulted, procedures in place for consultation, protection of sites of significance and access to the land, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem at the moment is that, with all the good intentions in the world about this, if you have just the right to negotiate or an expedited procedure, the full&hyphen;blown right to negotiate for most exploration is simply an inappropriate procedure. What is appropriate is set down in section 26A. Because there are thousands of these going through every year, the native title claimants and holders simply are not in a position to be able to respond to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10444"> every exploration proposal that is proposed for the expedited procedure. So about 80 per cent of these are being put to the expedited procedure which means they get no rights at all; the exploration licences are just issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of the situation, the paradox, is that you are saying, `With all the good intentions in the world, these things should happen.' The fact is that in relation to exploration, because of the volume, because you only have a choice between an expedited procedure and a full&hyphen;blown right to negotiate, it is not happening. This puts in place a mechanism to ensure that in relation to exploration all the things you just said will happen, and they are not at the moment. That is the irony of the proposition you put to us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to suggest that, for the benefit of miners, it would obviously be much better if the negotiation was done at an early stage before too much money is committed and they are advised at some later stage&mdash;not just other people being advised and having to take some sort of legal action but actually being in discussion with those indigenous traditional owners whom the mining project affects&mdash;what areas are of concern to them and what areas are not of concern. These areas can be dealt with at an early stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind honourable senators that, if you have states like Western Australia, we have often been told by governments of all sorts, `Don't worry because exploration really is a teeny&hyphen;weeny little thing.' First of all, you sometimes have kilometres on kilometres of very wide swaths cut through bushland to get to the stage where you make your exploration. So in fact exploration is not always a minimum impact activity. There might be the odd 87-year-old or 90&hyphen;year&hyphen;old fossicking, but there are also some quite substantial activities going under the guise of exploration, even perhaps trial crushing and so on that goes on for uranium. In reality, if there are no problems, obviously the right to negotiate is not going to be a problem either. But, if there are going to be problems, surely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is better for a company to be fully advised at that stage rather than commit large amounts of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not entirely sure about the mining acts of other states but in Western Australia, once a company has an exploration permit, it is extremely difficult for the mining per se not to go ahead. So, in reality, once exploration has gone ahead and minerals approved, it is almost a fait accompli. So in that case maybe we are dealing with a sort of automatic compensation if there are real problems. I do not think that is particularly wise. I think it is going to be better for industry if the right to negotiate can be done at an early stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to support Senator Margetts in this. The problem is that, unless you have negotiation at an early stage, it really then becomes impossible. One of the classic illustrations which is raised often in this chamber as proving the failure of the Native Title Act is the Century mine. I visited 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10445"> the Century mine three years ago and spent a day and a half talking to the miners and visiting Lawn Hill Gorge, which is next door.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although that was beyond the exploration stage, it certainly was not at the approval stage and there had been massive works carried out&mdash;a gigantic dam, which was the result of the dewatering of the area, massive road works, massive quarrying, massive storage. I am not saying that is inappropriate. That is obviously what should happen, but I am making the appeal that we have negotiations early enough so that we do not get halfway through a project and end up with the disaster we had in terms of negotiation with the Century mine. That is just another part of the story.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just for the record, can I say that the figure that Senator Minchin used of 80 per cent is one that I used. It is a figure that pertains to low impact acts. There are obviously low impact exploration acts. What we are concerned about, though, is that there be a capacity when it is more than a low impact act for there to be a right to negotiate at that particular part of the process. That is important. If 80 per cent are low impact, obviously a balance is struck in that, where there is low impact, the particular project of exploration can go ahead. We do not think that is unreasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a mechanism there to protect against acts of some substantial impact and it is important to keep that flexibility in the legislation. It is important for some sectors. As I said earlier, the petroleum and diamond industries are concerned that they have a capacity to negotiate up-front at the exploration stage. They are industries that do have a significant impact at the exploration stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we say, okay, 80 per cent go through to the keeper, but if someone disagrees with the definition of the act as a low impact act, there is still the capacity for that act to be further assessed, and that is an important part of the existing arrangements. The protection is there and matters do not necessarily get consigned to expedited procedures, but there is a capacity to protect. As I said earlier, rep bodies obviously will not waste their time and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resources to frustrate people with so many of these acts being involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though Senator Minchin might say there is potential for all these matters to be addressed, we still endorse the government's proposal, which I think is 24LA&mdash;the low impact future acts section. That has an impact in respect of low impact future acts and they just go ahead with no right to negotiate. As well as that, the provisions in 26A provide for ministers to be able to determine at their own discretion to exclude certain classes of exploration acts from the right to negotiate at the exploration stage. That is something of concern, especially when you look at the fact that the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second condition is that the Minister considers that the act or acts are unlikely to have a significant impact on the particular land or waters concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And proposed subsection (4) says that, in terms of satisfying that condition, acts authorising drilling, for instance, are not to be taken as acts of significant impact on the particular land or waters concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we maintain that, with the capacity to protect in cases of more than low impact acts and with the capacity to ensure that the definition of those acts can be adjudged if it is seen to be unfair, those provisions are much fairer in that particular part of the process to the native title claimant. At the same time, to the extent that they have been used so far, it shows that they are working to satisfy the required balance for industry concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Minchin would acknowledge those arguments, together with the fact that it is important that we do not seek to amend your proposed section 24LA in respect of low impact future acts. It basically strikes an appropriate balance. For instance, we are concerned under the government's proposal that you may finish up digging holes the size of public swimming pools, and that still may fall under the category of 26A, approved scheme acts. There needs to be a balance and, at the moment, no case has been put forward to say that the current provisions really frustrate. It is a difficult area but I think it is fair to judge that, to the extent that it has

The subdivision does not apply to the extent that the act is an act relating solely to land or waters wholly within a town or a city.

I hope that I will have the support of the National Party and the government senators from the country in proposing this measure.

We are not talking about freehold title, we are talking about the right to negotiate for a mining lease, for example, on crown land. The committee should know that this is a very crucial situation. Let nobody in this chamber think that it is about the right to negotiate over a children's playground which is on crown land, for example. We are talking about mining leases and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the crown has a right of compulsory acquisition. This was the case in the example that was given in the explanatory memorandum. However, as I say, is it not important for native title holders to have some say about that? Three miles down the road, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they do have a say about it. Why, within a town boundary, is there so much difference? I think it is a discriminatory situation, and it does not only affect Aboriginal persons whose native title happens to be within city or town boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just because you have native title does not mean you have a right to negotiate, because that is a statutory right. The ludicrous situation is that those people are placed in a different circumstance to people three or four miles down the road out of the town boundary on particular crown land which may, for example, be a parking spot off a highway. I repeat&mdash;and I look forward to support from country senators&mdash;that it is also discriminatory against people in country areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Discrimination lies in the eyes of the beholder. Essentially, in towns and cities the issue that arises is almost overwhelmingly a matter of compulsorily acquisition. Compulsorily acquisition of areas for developments within towns and cities happens all the time, and government policy is that people in towns and cities should be treated equally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any native title claimants or holders on any VCL within a town or city are guaranteed the procedural rights of a freeholder. They generally are, at least, the right to be notified, to be consulted, to object and to be heard. It is not as though they do not have a say; they do. We strongly believe in non&hyphen;discrimination in relation to those Australians in towns and cities subject to compulsorily acquisition for the purposes that often occur in relation to towns and cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an area is being compulsorily acquired for a purpose&mdash;and it may well involve native title holders or claimants on vacant crown land, as well as freeholders right alongside the bit of vacant crown land&mdash;then we believe, as a matter of principle, that there should be no discrimination in the treatment of those people. The rights accorded to the freeholders shall be the rights accorded to any native title claimants and holders right next door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate where Senator Harradine is coming from. This is one of the issues that is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10454"> always a problem in relation to discrimination, but in our view it is discriminatory in a town or city to say that, when an area is being acquired for a development of that kind, the freeholder has the freeholding procedural rights that apply, but the native title claimants or holders next door have a different and&mdash;almost always, under the right to negotiate&mdash;superior right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of policy, we think that is inappropriate. Outside towns and cities it is a different question. You are normally dealing with mining there, where, as we have said, on vacant crown land, that will remain, and where the right to negotiate may well be more appropriate. That is the policy. It is not some attempt to deny native title claimants and holders within towns and cities their rights. They have the rights of the freeholders who are right alongside them and who, in many cases, will have their property acquired as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why the opposition has a similar, if not identical, amendment to this. We maintain a very strongly held view that there is no basis to discriminate on the basis of the location. We can understand the government putting up this sort of proposal and thinking that it would have some popular appeal. But the reality is that there is no reasonable basis at law or otherwise to deny native title holders the protection of the right to negotiate simply because their land is within a town or city boundary. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly so in a number of cases. For instance, we have had evidence that there was supposed to be a township of Hatches Creek in the Northern Territory, but the proposed town was never developed. It has remained vacant crown land from the time it was gazetted. The nearest actual town is Tennant Creek, some 150 kilometres away. So we have had that sort of rorting of the system in the past and we are concerned that that should not continue&mdash;the basic principle being that native title in respect of crown land has some relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is also another situation in the Northern Territory. The Anurette Aboriginal Land Trust has land lying within it, and that land is now subject to an accepted native title determination. Many of the native title holders actually live on a community nearby. If the government's proposal were to be passed in the Senate, they would be deprived of the right to negotiate over the township, an area which is highly prospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we oppose this amendment for two reasons: first of all, the fundamental principle in respect of native title applying to crown land and non-acceptance by us of the artificial barrier that has been proposed by the government; and also the fact that there has been capacity to rort the system in the past. For instance, at one stage I think Darwin's boundaries were defined to be as big as Sydney's.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do just want to respond to that, because you are dealing with an entirely different situation in towns and cities than you are outside towns and cities that Senator Harradine talks about. There is a lot more pressure in terms of development in growing towns and cities. They have to be able to expand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in Western Australia is a very significant problem. Because the right to negotiate does not work as some people think it does, where you can have it all done in eight months, that does not happen. There are right to negotiate processes in Western Australia that are still taking three years. These things do not happen in eight months. Because of the complexity of the right to negotiate process, the avenues for legal opportunities to delay the process are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are finding in places like Kalgoorlie that there has been no new land released for residential or industrial purposes since March 1995 because of native title claims. The people in Karratha, Western Australia, are experiencing land price hikes of up to 300 per cent due to a shortage of land for development, because of native title claims in and around the city and the impossibility of working through them and getting resolution of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very major problem particularly in towns and cities in Western Australia but in other parts of Australia as well. It is causing considerable concern and social unrest in places like Kalgoorlie and Karratha. We believe this is the only way through this process. We have done this for genuine policy reasons that are a consequence of the problems that are being experienced on the ground in those sorts of towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are getting social unrest because of the intractability of the native title claims, the incapacity to work your way through them because of current problems in the act. Because you have all these multiple claimants, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you cannot get agreements; so people are resorting to court to break the process down. That is why you are getting these sorts of manifest problems in places like Kalgoorlie and Karratha.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that what we are proposing is absolutely fair, equitable and non&hyphen;discriminatory because it is treating everyone in town and city boundaries exactly the same. They will all have the rights of freeholders in relation to any requirement for development of suburbs and growth of towns and cities, which is something all Australians should want. One of the problems we have is the contraction in Australia. We want our rural and regional towns and cities to develop.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I first of all put at rest the minds of persons around the chamber. I refer to the Native Title Act as it stands at the present moment on page 17. Under the act, if there is to be compulsory acquisition, it applies only in respect of compulsory acquisition and mining. That is what we are talking about. We are only talking about two things. When we are talking about the rights to negotiate in the country people are thinking of their backyards and all the rest of it. It is not that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, I do not count Senator Bishop as one of those, because he is a lawyer and has been around. He is a very thoughtful senator and a great contributor to this place. I just put directly to him in response to his question that, under the act, if there is compulsory acquisition or mining on land, then there is a right to negotiate under the Native Title Act. It does not matter if the claim is in the city or the country. What we are really saying is that the native title claimant has the right to negotiate only if there is compulsory acquisition or mining. Otherwise, of course, there is a determination of the matter in the Federal Court. So let us get that perfectly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talked about the problems in a number of places in Western Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There are problems all over the place and there are matters which have to be determined. Might I just remind the Senate of one thing. If those provisions had not been in the act, then there would not have been such a ready result in the first native title successful claim at Crescent Head in New South Wales. If we had taken this away a while ago&mdash;as the government is proposing to do now&mdash;then that first native title claim would not have been able to be so satisfactorily settled in Australia. That is what the government is suggesting here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to put on the record the facts of that particular native title claim and how it was settled. It is a major milestone in Australia's history. The process of reconciliation was this determination of the first native title claim at Crescent Head in New South Wales on 7 April this year. If we are talking about reconciliation, this is an important measure. Obviously, there are other matters that are as important for reconciliation as these, but this is a very important Australian milestone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This claim, in fact, involved land subject to a compulsory acquisition order. The land was in the boundaries of the country town Crescent Head in the Macleay Valley of New South Wales. There is much similar crown land in country towns throughout Australia, especially on the east coast of the mainland. The settlement which led to the determination of native title was the first such deed of settlement between the crown and indigenous people since white settlement in 1788. So it was a historic occasion. At the Federal Court on 7 April there were 60 Dainggatti elders as well as the mayor of Kempsey and the Attorney&hyphen;General of New South Wales. This determination of native title was a triumph for reconciliation and the negotiating processes under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a national scandal, surely, and an embarrassment to the Commonwealth parliament that the state processes for this category of claim are proposed to be eliminated. Were they too successful, one asks? From now on, compulsory acquisition or mining must be outside towns and cities to attract the right to negotiate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10457">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Crescent Head claim was completed in two years and six months. The full submission to the claimants was filed within 12 months of the acceptance of the claim in 1994. The deed of settlement was signed 12 months later after extensive negotiations involving the state government, the shire council, the local residents and indigenous people. I am glad to see the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, Senator Boswell, come in at this vital time because, might I say, the first settlement of a native title claim in Australia was praised by the local state National Party member and the regional media. The involvement of the process through the right to negotiate was all important for this result. We are talking about process; that was the important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason, in principle, why compulsory acquisition in a rural area triggers a right to negotiation and compulsory acquisition in a town or city does not, especially in widespread country towns in Australia. There has been no reason&mdash;with reference to history or experience&mdash;to suggest that good faith negotiations in claims such as that at Crescent Head should not be resolved in a reasonable time. This is particularly so where there is a body of expertise such as the National Native Title Tribunal to assist in the native title process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first native title determination attracted wide publicity for Australia in Asia and Europe in both the print and electronic media. It was a great national event. The statutory ingredients should not be discarded by this parliament for future similar claims.</PARA>

Amendment 124 deletes the retrospective provision the government was proposing with respect to the provision of a once&hyphen;only right to negotiate. Amendments 125 and 126 provide for the exclusion of the right to negotiate by reason only of an early agreement that there would be no further negotiations at production stage&mdash;that was a government proposal. They are part of our proposal to ensure that you can, by early agreement, ensure that there be no further negotiations at the production stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 127 ensures that the right to negotiate can apply by agreement. Amendments 128 and 129 are consequential amendments and 130 provides a mechanism to ensure that governments follow the future act provisions by allowing a claimant to apply to the Federal Court to stop an act which should have gone through the right to negotiate process. These are all consequential on the decision we took earlier on to provide for a right to negotiate in the exploration stage. There probably does not need to be much debate on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst Senator Harradine is occupied, what probably would be a useful thing to do is for us to take up Senator Harradine's invitation. The amendments we are talking about are 142 and 148. They are in fact appropriate to be handled here. Our concern is that there is a capacity for ministerial intervention in arbitration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, our amendments remove 36A and replace it with a process for intervention by a Commonwealth minister upon notice to the arbitral body and if it is in the national interest at the time. That is 142 and 148&mdash;the national interest requirement. The government amendment provides that a state or territory minister may intervene in the arbitration of a right to negotiate if the body has failed to make a determination in the specified four-month period. There are no notice requirements and the criteria for intervention are that the arbitral body is unlikely to make a determination within a reasonable period that is in the state or territory interest&mdash;or a national interest if it is a Commonwealth matter&mdash;to make the determination at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are procedural provisions in 36B(3) which require the minister to invite submissions with the notice for receipt of those submissions at the minister's discretion. The minister must distribute submissions to other parties and provide them with seven days in which to respond. The minister, unfortunately to say the least, is not required to consider the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are concerned as to three aspects. We are concerned as to the conflict of interest issue which Senator Harradine mentioned earlier on: a state or territory minister will be party to the right to negotiate negotiations in which he or she will find himself or herself intervening. We have to protect against that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no requirement for the minister to consider the submissions and there is no review process. So not only do you have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10466"> conflict of interest problem but you really have a good faith problem as well. In terms of notice, the process and the time frames for registered claimants to make submissions are left to the minister's discretion. That also is a very unacceptable situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept that there may be rare situations such as, for instance, where an arbitral body refuses to make a determination where it is necessary to finalise the process for the benefit of all concerned. Due to the conflict of interest problems that I referred to, it is inappropriate for the state or territory minister to have the responsibility. So we have proposed amendments 142 and 148 which we think overcome the conflict of natural justice problems in the government's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They provide a process through which the Commonwealth minister may place the arbitral body on notice, giving them 30 days after the arbitral period of four months with respect to exploration or six months with respect to mining and acquisitions. That notice can be given and the minister can then make determinations if the body has failed to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment No. 169 is a provision which tackles some of the government amendments as to the process. For instance, on page 101 of the government's bill, it makes an addition to the sorts of conditions that the tribunal could lay down. In doing so, it gives the tribunal a capacity to include financial conditions. So you can have an arbitral determination in respect of financial conditions. It removes the limitation proposed by the government to exclude the same. Further, it ensures that a determination can provide for further negotiations at a later stage; that is in the hands of the system. It provides what we think are necessary and effective enforcement mechanisms for this type of determination. We do this by adding subsections 38(3) and (4) to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will operate on the presumption that it has been withdrawn from the original ALP amendments. Therefore, the remarks I previously made should be directed to Senator Harradine in respect of his amendment No. 30. It is true that the discussion paper we released early last year in an objective sense included in it this proposition. It was put to us by Aboriginal bodies in particular that the arbitral body should be able to determine a condition worked out by reference to the amount of profits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is in contradiction to section 38(2) of the current Native Title Act, which specifically prohibits companies from doing that. We were persuaded on a variety of grounds that it was right to retain the current prohibition on the arbitral body making a determination of that kind for a whole variety of reasons. It goes to the question of an arbitral body of this kind imposing a royalty payment when royalties are a consequence of the crown owning minerals and a tax levied in respect of that going to the crown; that is, the government representing all of us, as a consequence of the fact that all of us own the minerals. Companies might have charged a tax in the form of a royalty for the use of those minerals, which we all own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are legal questions about the capacity of an arbitral body to impose a tax or a royalty of that kind in making a determination as to whether or not an act should proceed. I think it is also the case that it could act as a disincentive to reaching agreement. If you could hold out and get the arbitral body to make a determination of that kind, it would act as a disincentive to reaching agreements. We were persuaded, for a whole variety of reasons, that the proposition involved in your amendment No. 30 is extremely unattractive, legally dubious and something that should not be adopted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of that, one of the reasons why there is no Brandy problem is because the arbitral body would not be imposing a decision. The decision would only take effect after a court's determination as to that decision. In the same way that you have arbitration, if it is agreed to, then it can have effect, but if it is not agreed to, then it has no effect until it is adopted or a decision is made by the court. That is the advice we have had from our Queen's Counsel, and I have no reason to doubt that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not do something like that then we have an inconsistency where parties are allowed to negotiate as to agreements in respect of profit sharing, but if they cannot come to an agreement and it then goes to the arbitration process, this aspect is taken out of the arbitration process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that the incentive for parties to come to an agreement is not there. If you were a party against whom a claim was made on notice, and you knew that after a six&hyphen;month period you would not have to embark upon discussions with the claimants as to profit sharing, and that you would only have to find yourself arbitrated upon in terms of a more limited range of activities, then obviously you would hold out. There would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be no incentive for you to sit down and negotiate on the broader range of aspects available at that early stage in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really works in an unfair manner against indigenous Australians. It is conducive to not having an agreement in the negotiating period. It stands to reason that if, at the end of six months, certain things are off the table in terms of capacity to negotiate, then you would hang out for the six months and you would make the other party go to the table on a narrower range of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, Brandy is not a problem. It is not a problem because determinations are not binding and will have no binding effect. If they are agreed to, they can obviously be implemented. If they are not agreed to, then it is a court that makes a determination; and that determination is binding.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 10 to 11 so I forgive Senator Bolkus, but that was a most confusing exposition. We have replicated exactly the same arrangements that are in the current act with regard to the difference between the negotiation phase and the arbitration phase. That is, as in our bill and as in the current act, the parties are free to come to agreement if they so choose&mdash;willingly and voluntarily enter into agreements about payments relating to profits, income derived or things produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you should not constrain parties to reach an agreement on those things. But, as in the current act agreed to by you back in 1993, the arbitral body is expressly prevented from making a determination in relation to the right to negotiate process&mdash;this has nothing to do with the Federal Court, Senator Bolkus. It cannot make a determination where payments are worked out by reference to profits, income or things produced. This is arbitration in the right to negotiate. This has nothing to do with the determination of native title. This is about whether the future act can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why there is a problem. This is an arbitral body. It is the Native Title Tribunal or an equivalent state body&mdash;an administrative body&mdash;being given the opportunity to impose a tax. If you say it can impose financial

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that, if you put in a specific power to determine financial conditions and you take away the restriction or the prohibition on those financial conditions being profits, income derived, things produced, et cetera, then you do have a problem as to what is meant by `financial conditions'.

Of course, it is about protecting sites but it is also about protecting your lives and your health. You cannot separate that from the environment. It is about the quality of water. It is about whether or not aquifers are joined. It is about whether or not the tailings dams that are left in mines are toxic. It is about whether or not the impact kills the vegetation. There are all sorts of impacts. It is ridiculous to consider that you pull that out and say that you cannot consider the environment. It makes no sense at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to put on the record at least something about this, or my views about it, at all events. Clause 43(a) of the government's explanatory memorandum in relation to that on page 150 advises that the amendment bill commits the states and territories to implement alternative provisions for future acts affecting leased or reserved areas. The states and territories will only have to give native title holders the same procedural rights as other parties with an interest in the land, for example, the holder of a non&hyphen;exclusive pastoral lease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment to the current right to negotiate provisions would be unacceptable. Native title holders whose lands are subject to pastoral lease or included in a national park or subject to Aboriginal statutory grants should not be deprived of the right to negotiation. Given that native title holders whose lands are vacant crown land will be assured by Commonwealth legislation of the right to negotiate, there is no justification for permitting the removal of that right from native title holders whose lands have been subject to state tenures granted to third parties before 1993 without their consent. If those tenures were granted before 1975 there is not even an entitlement for compensation for the interference with native title rights. That is my reason for opposing clause 43A.</PARA>

The test that it is `not likely to interfere directly with' is much more difficult, as a protective mechanism, than the test that it `does not directly interfere with.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a good time to hit upon a new topic. Freehold test is one where the opposition does have some amendments, so does Senator Harradine and so do the Greens and Democrats. We have heard often in this debate the government say that the test should be what happens in respect to freehold. One could very easily have gone on to argue: well, let's let the acquisition processes apply in respect to some of the acquisitions we are actually implementing in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The freehold test is one that is in the Native Title Act and it ensures that future acts are only permissible if they are non&hyphen;discriminatory in the sense that the act applies in the same way to native title holders as it would for other ordinary titles to land. Ordinary titles in essence means freehold titles. In that respect a key principle is the non&hyphen;discriminatory freehold test, and that key principle was a basic foundation of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some exceptions to this rule under the current Native Title Act but they are very limited and they are limited compared with the government's proposed amendments which will not require the non&hyphen;discriminatory freehold test to be satisfied for many major developments. These are some of the aspects that we discussed earlier on in the committee process, things such as primary production activity, renewals, extensions, reservations and so on. As set out, the aim of those amendments, and the concern about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aim of those amendments, was to allow discrimination against native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect to the old freehold test, as set out in section 24MD, the government is proposing a couple of new amendments. In respect to opal and gem mining, they are proposing an amendment there because we believe that under some state legislation the holder of freehold has a right of veto over opal and gem mining. This means that if the non&hyphen;discrimination test applies, then the native title holders in those states would also have the right of veto over opal and gem mining. To prevent this, the bill has excluded opal and gem mining from the freehold test. What we are proposing is a more limited right of negotiation in respect to opal and gem miners. For us, it would be inconsistent to support a position that insists on an effective right of veto in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of major concern is where land is compulsorily acquired. Then the native title is extinguished at the date of the acquisition, even if the land is never used. That is of particular concern to us. The common law position and the position under the act was that the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applied and extinguishment could only occur when there was an actual act which took place that extinguished native title at common law, for instance, the grant of a freehold title. Until that occurred the mere acquisition of the land by the government did not extinguish native title. We are concerned that this proposal is to be an exception to the freehold test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further concern is in respect to extinguishment. What the government is providing is that extinguishment occurs for compulsory acquisitions, as I have detailed. We believe that this is unnecessary; it goes further than the common law. The mere acquisition without actual inconsistent use can coexist with the native title and should be allowed to do so. There is no reason also why such extinguishment should be permanent and not able to revive after the public work is no longer used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe our amendments are an improvement in that they do qualify the parts relating to extinguishment. However, it should be noted that our concerns go to three or four 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10480"> areas. I must also add that the bill further limits the requirement in the Native Title Act that the native title holders should have the same procedural rights as ordinary title holders by excluding approved exploration acts and gold and tin mining et cetera. These are dealt with in the right to negotiate section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A concern also is that the bill provides that notification is removed in some instances, such as notices to the public. Overall, we do not see a justification for most of these exceptions to the non&hyphen;discrimination principle. Our amendments are designed to remove the further acts of discrimination proposed by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just speak to this section on the freehold test in terms of the relevant sections. Section 24MA sets out the basic freehold test for legislative acts that affect native title rights. The law must apply in the same way to native title holders as it would if they held ordinary title, generally the freehold test&mdash;which is what we have been saying throughout this debate&mdash;and that test would be met by a law that permits mining on native title and freehold land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The freehold test is currently contained in section 23 and in definitions in sections 235 and 253. This provision moves the main definition provision from section 235 to within the future act regime in division 3 subdivision M, so it is a restructuring of the act and, of course, the test remains the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 24MB sets out the basic freehold test for non&hyphen;legislative acts, such as compulsory acquisitions and mining grants. The test is that the act could be done in relation to native title land if the native title holders instead held ordinary title, generally freehold title. For onshore waters, such as rivers and lakes, the test is that the act could be done in relation to the waters if the native title holders held ordinary title to the land joining surrounding waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is put here as part of the general restructuring of the freehold test that we have performed in the surgery on this particular piece of legislation. Section 24MC makes it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear that subdivision M dealing with `Acts passing the freehold test' does not apply to acts offshore, they are dealt with separately in subdivision N. In the current act, onshore future acts and offshore future acts are dealt with together in section 23 and relevant definitions in sections 235 and 253, and that is confusing for users of the act. Therefore, we have split them into separate subdivisions for workability reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 24MD sets out the consequences for future acts which pass the freehold test set out in sections 24MA and 24MB. Acts that pass the test are valid. Native title can only be extinguished by a compulsory acquisition provided that the acquisition law permits acquisition of native title and non-native title rights and native title and non&hyphen;native title rights are acquired. If an extinguishing compulsory acquisition order does not provide just terms compensation, then that is provided by the section, as is an ability for the native title holders to request non&hyphen;monetary compensation. Apart from compulsory acquisitions which meet those requirements, all other future acts are subject to the non-extinguishment principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those other non&hyphen;extinguishing acts, compensation is provided by the Native Title Act if ordinary title holders would get compensation in the same circumstances, but the law does not provide compensation to non&hyphen;native title holders. In other words, compensation is provided by these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title holders can recover compensation from the Commonwealth if it is an act attributable to the Commonwealth or the states and territories to whom it is attributable. The law may provide that if the act is done at the request of a person, that person is liable for the compensation. For example, compensation in relation to mining is often made payable by the miner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to compensation for the compulsory acquisition of native title on a non&hyphen;exclusive pastoral agricultural lease, the native title holders are not entitled to recover from the lessee and must recover from the relevant government. Native title holders generally have the same procedural rights as ordinary title holders in regard to future acts which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10481"> pass the freehold test and, as I said before, the exception to that is acts subject to the right to negotiate. If these procedural rights require notification and there has been no determination of native title, then this notification can be to any rep body or registered claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have actually protected and strengthened the protection of native title from extinguishment. New section 24MDB provides that a requirement for extinguishment is that the compulsory acquisition take both native title and any relevant non&hyphen;native title rights in relation to the land. But there are clearly legitimate land management needs such as suburban developments, public infrastructure and agricultural developments where, in the event that agreement cannot be reached, compulsory acquisition of all title on the land will be necessary. That is provided for under these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved several government amendments, Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30. If you are happy with it, I will speak briefly to those. I move:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 27 is to propose subsection 24MD(2) which provides that native title onshore can be extinguished by a non&hyphen;discri 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minatory compulsory acquisition. The requirement of such a non&hyphen;discriminatory process is that non&hyphen;native title interests are also acquired. The amendment removes the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' from this requirement with regard to non&hyphen;native title interests. We have included that in response to concerns expressed by some that the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' may in some way be discriminatory or permit compulsory acquisitions that are discriminatory. That is certainly not our intention, so we are happy to remove those words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 28 is in a similar vein. It ensures that the practices and procedures adopted in relation to a compulsory acquisition do not cause native title holders to be any more disadvantaged than the holders of other rights and interests when their rights are required to further ensure a non-discriminatory process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 29 is an amendment which adjusts the provision which allows the Commonwealth to pass on native title compensation liabilities to third parties. It will make it clear that if a law of the Commonwealth states that a third party is liable for the compensation, then that third party and not the Commonwealth is liable. Amendment 30 does that with respect to the states as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have some difficulty with the approach put forward by the ALP. There are amendments which deal with the application of heritage protection requirements. We had this debate before and we say that the Native Title Act is not about heritage matters. That is a matter for the relevant Commonwealth, state and territory legislation, and not for this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP also seeks to omit reference to gem and opal mining, and that is something we also cannot agree to. It is our view that the effect of that amendment would be to render opal and gem mining impermissible under the Native Title Act where state and territory legislation allows freeholders a veto over mining. That is a significant problem and one, I would have thought, that the ALP would have been alive to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also this issue of the nature of the extinguishment. The ALP would say that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10482"> extinguishment occurs in relation to the acquisition of native title rights and interests only when the act for which the rights are required is actually done. There is absolutely nothing in the common law to support that proposition. It is certainly our view of the common law that native title is extinguished at the point of acquisition. We think that there are considerable problems if it is not at the point of acquisition. If you are talking about compensation on the point of acquisition, but native title is not extinguished, then there are major problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also have significant problems if the government acquires land for suburban development&mdash;and you are saying that the native title is not extinguished by that acquisition. Let us say, then, that the land is passed on to somebody else before there is a development upon it and the native title is subsisting. When it is sold on, it is sold on the basis that there was a compulsory acquisition, but native title has not been extinguished and continues to subsist in the land even when it has been sold and it is there until the land is actually used, even though compensation has presumably been paid for the acquisition of the native title through the compulsory acquisition process. I think that that is legally chaotic and not consistent with the common law, and we could not support it. That is all I have to say at this stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably one of the most important amendments here is amendment No. 95&mdash;which I think is the equivalent of the opposition amendment 105&mdash;that limits the extinguishment of native title upon compulsory acquisition to those activities which would have extinguished native title at common law. Remember the government claims that there is no extinguishment of native title in this bill. This is, in fact, quite clearly extinguishment of those aspects of native title which would not have been extinguished under common law. So we are going further than the provisions that exist under common law. I really do not think that that is acceptable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is seeking to remove the future act regime under the current Native Title Act and to replace it with provisions designed to ensure formal equality between native title holders and freeholders. The Democrats, the Greens and, most importantly, the National Indigenous Working Group, oppose the government's approach because native title cannot, and should not, be equated to freehold. The current provisions in the Native Title Act regarding future acts attempt to provide a comprehensive scheme for ensuring that native title holders are accorded appropriate procedural and substantive rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without these provisions, native title could well be rendered unenforceable for indigenous people. Without the right to negotiate all future act provisions, native title can be extinguished and impaired piece by piece without any protection or recourse for native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, native title holders' rights to just terms compensation when native title lands are compulsorily acquired remain under the government's provisions. I note that earlier in this debate the committee agreed to remove the need for governments to compulsorily acquire native title lands to develop public infrastructure facilities. The Democrats oppose this move. However, I note that the requirement for the payment of just terms compensation remains. As we are all aware, this is a constitutional requirement. Nothing the government can do in proposing its current amendments can take this away. Indeed, I believe that the government does not wish to take this right away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a very large extent, non&hyphen;indigenous people in this country have come to almost worship the notion of freehold title which, as we know, provides land tenure of exclusive possession. Let us think about that for a moment: the notion of exclusivity means not sharing with anyone. It is quite reasonable in a modern democratic state that people have some possession and some spaces in this land of ours that give them exclusive possession. Nobody would quibble with that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10483">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we presently have a government that has an ideological obsession rooted in economic fundamentalism that says all property needs to be in the hands of private individuals or under private control. That is why the Howard government sold Telstra, the national railways and a host of other government facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one in this place is under any illusion about the Australian Democrats' position on privatising publicly owned assets. On the other hand, when we look at the government's ideological obsession, it becomes a little easier to understand why the government is so keen on confirming exclusive possession. However, the High Court has confirmed the principles of coexistence; of sharing land of coexisting title. However much the government may wish that had not happened, that is the trend in many countries where indigenous peoples have a history of prior occupation of land. But this government wants to turn back the clock. The Democrats will not support going back to a time when indigenous people were pushed to the fringes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that under the white legal system land title can only be understood in terms of exclusive tenure, so people get very scared and confused when anything else is suggested. Indigenous cultural and spiritual affinity with land is often explained in terms of English common land law. Understanding indigenous attitudes to land in this way is patronising in the extreme and a flawed and colonialist approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's freehold test removes the requirement for adequate notification which is in the current act. There is no justification for removing these provisions. In fact, the Democrats and Greens will move amendments to strengthen notification and other procedural protections. If there is to be any adjustment to the current system, the Democrats believe that it should be to strengthen the procedural protections afforded native title holders, not to weaken them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's freehold test is discriminatory because it excludes the test from native title lands over which it is proposed to permit opal or gem mining. Why does the government want to exclude the freehold test from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these matters? Because in some states freeholders have the right to veto opal and gem mining on their lands. If the government was genuine in its desire to see formal equality between native title holders and freeholders, it would clearly ensure that native title holders would retain the same right of veto on such activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also maintain that extinguishment of native title from activities under these provisions should be limited to the extinguishment that would occur under the common law. There is no need for the amount of extinguishment to be greater than is necessary to give effect to the act that is required to be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to explain that the philosophical underpinning of the Democrats' opposition to these amendments is based on our belief that it is not appropriate to seek formal equality between the rights of native title holders and freeholders. Native title holders have a special and unique relationship with the land. This relationship simply does not exist between freeholders and their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one is saying that non-indigenous people who have lived in a particular place for a long time do not develop a deep appreciation for the land upon which they live. No-one is saying that non-indigenous freeholders do not love their land or country. But it must be apparent to everyone here that the relationship that native title holders have with their country&mdash;a relationship which has existed for thousands of years&mdash;continues today and will continue. The relationship is cultural, spiritual and sacred and is no less important than, and is in the same category as, the relationship that Jews have to Jerusalem, Catholics to the Vatican, and Moslems to Mecca.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 this parliament moved to recognise that relationship by establishing protective procedures to ensure that native title can be extinguished only if appropriate procedures are followed, and then only to the absolute extent necessary for the proposed activity. I urge senators to recognise the reasons behind the decision that was made in 1993 and maintain, and indeed strengthen, the protections that were established then. I

Amendment 18 seeks to delete in line 13 of 24MD(2)(b) the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise'. I hope it generally would be agreed around the chamber that it would be racially discriminatory to allow the compulsory acquisition of proven native title rights not for public purpose but simply for the grant of right of exclusive possession to a lessee who has voluntarily surrendered a non&hyphen;exclusive tenure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this upgrade of pastoral leases proposals were truly non-discriminatory, it would have to be non-discriminatory on its face and non-discriminatory in its application. This would mean it would be equally feasible for native title holders voluntarily to surrender their native title rights and to successfully request state governments compulsorily to acquire pastoral lease and then issue the native title holders with rights of exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaseholders attempting to upgrade could go along to a state government and say, `We want to upgrade. We do not want to go through all this hassle. You compulsorily acquire our leasehold rights, and then we will buy it back and have it as freehold.' Amendment 18 says that compulsory acquisition of native title rights should be possible only on the same terms and conditions as the compulsory acquisition of all involuntary resumption of other property rights. Compulsory acquisition of native title rights should not complement a voluntary surrender of a pastoral lease. In other words, it is keeping everybody honest. A similar principle applies to my amendment No. 19.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I cannot think of a more appropriate recipe for vagueness and uncertainty. As I said before in my other remarks, if a compulsory acquisition of native title by the government does not amount to an extinguishment, I think it just leads to an extraordinary situation where you have no idea what the effect is, what native title survives, and what its relationship is to the nature of the land. And what about the question of   compensation that may have been paid as a result of the compulsory acquisition?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you compulsorily acquire something, you extinguish it. If you compulsorily acquire freehold title, the freehold title is removed from the person holding the freehold title. They are not paid compensation for the acquisition of their freehold title and then still hold the title. When someone compulsorily acquires title, the title is gone. You are paid compensation&mdash;end of story.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To introduce the circular argument, and the ludicrous situation, where you have a compulsory acquisition of native title but the native title stays there somehow&mdash;it is not extinguished&mdash;is an absolute legal nonsense. And 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is the convoluted expression about the common law: that is the law; this seeks to change the law. The law is that, if a government acts using its compulsory acquisition powers to acquire title, it acquires the title, and that is the end of the title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I make a few introductory comments in respect of confirmation of extinguishment? Our view is that there is no need for it. Our view is in fact that, if you were being honest about what you are doing here, you would actually call it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `extinguishment by false pretences'. What we are talking about here is going much broader and much wider than the common law, and doing so under some specious argument of `absolute certainty'. In criminal law, you would probably get put away for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that people have assumed that such interests as freehold, all types of leases, public works, et cetera, all extinguish native title; but the Wik decision did show to some extent, in respect to some of these areas, that the law is unfair&mdash;and I do say `in respect to some of these areas'. There is no vagueness, no unclarity and no uncertainty in terms of what happens to people's backyards: they are safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will say that they need to make it clear that these interests extinguish native title; however, this has got to be seen as a poor description of the effect of the common law. What we are talking about here are the bucketfuls of extinguishment by division 2B and also by the schedule. In many ways, I think we will be remembered for this one, as well. This is one of the most discriminatory, unjust and, probably, loose part of this legislation. It is a blatant removal of rights from people of a certain race, without any justification. So&hyphen;called uncertainty is removed just by the mere act of removing the rights of one group of people. The only stated justification we have from the government for this confirmation is that they want to allow development and interest to be granted over land without having to consider native title at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are doing here is totally contrary to the spirit of Wik. They are rejecting the concept of coexistence and they are doing so in a way which really is unscientific. At the end of the day, Australian taxpayers will have to pay for both the uncertainty and the excessiveness of acquisition. We are talking about acquisition by division 2B and we are talking about, for instance, the schedule. If you look at the schedule, you will find that it is not a list of particular and specific leases but a list of categories of leases. In analysing that list of categories of leases, from time to time we found during the parliamentary committee work that some leases had been submitted that should not be there, and that some leases 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10490"> were in fact added to the list but should not have been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about rifle ranges, defence purposes, water tanks and so on extinguishing native title: if there was ever such a scheduled interest as the ones I have mentioned, even in the distant past, then native title is extinguished. That is bad enough in itself; but what the government then goes on to do&mdash;just in case they missed out on the shopping list from the states in terms of the categories of leases they wanted to put on&mdash;is give themselves a broad, unencumbered, undefined regulatory power to add further to the register of extinguishing lease categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has to be a major concern in this place because, first, the government wants to give itself that power; second, that power is in no way defined; and, third, the impact of exercise of that uncontrollable regulatory power is something that will have direct impact on indigenous native title claimants. The other concern is that we are talking here not of actual leases that provide for exclusive possession but about generic groupings. The government did not spend the time to actually go through and define the exclusive possession leases. So we are concerned about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that in schedule 4 we have community purpose leases which extinguish native title. We are concerned about the curious arrangement that now pertains under this legislation in respect of stock routes. Stock routes were originally part of the definition of `public works', but this set of government changes will provide that stock routes are not public works except for the purposes of validation of past or future acts. In other words, what we will have is a situation where the old pre&hyphen;1975 stock routes probably do not extinguish native title. However, as `public works' under the new definition in this bill, they will extinguish native title when validated. This will leave a curious situation where 1975 to 1996 stock routes do extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned also that previous non&hyphen;exclusive possession acts are said to extinguish native title, and that includes pastoral leases which do not confer exclusive possession. We are also particularly concerned that, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under clause 23E, states will be given similar power to confirm extinguishment if they have similar laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ongoing concern that we have is that what is provided for here is a regime of permanent extinguishment, when the common law makes it clear that that particular aspect has not been determined. Permanent extinguishment is just unjustifiable in terms of the common law. We are adopting a position in this respect where our amendments are designed to remove the whole section dealing with extinguishment and to remove the definition of `extinguishment' which makes extinguishment permanent. There are also consequential amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will raise some concerns with it. They will run the line of uncertainty and so on. But if you really want uncertainty in this regime of extinguishment, I say to you once again that this particular provision will finish up in the High Court within hours of it being approved by Executive Council. It will be open to challenge under the common law; it will be open to challenge under the races power. Once again, we are talking here of extinguishment of one race's rights without appropriately timed compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also say something else: if you want uncertainty, you basically poison the atmosphere; this particular unilateral, oppressive act will do just that. The just terms compensation provisions of the constitution are not satisfied. The government says that 53A provides for just terms value in a two&hyphen;step approach, but it does not even attempt to provide just terms in terms of the processes and contemporaneous&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;nature of the constitutional requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I make is that, under the government's amendments circulated this week&mdash;amendments we support&mdash;it has proposed to create in the future another statutory exception to the general rule that native title is extinguished and cannot ever be claimed when there has been a freehold title granted. It is a curious thing that the government is doing here, given the rhetoric of the last couple of weeks. But, for instance, where a claim is made under vacant crown land not currently covered by freehold estate or lease 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10491"> but where there has, in fact, been such a title then this situation will prevail. We are talking here about proposed new section 47B of government amendment No. 45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I indicate that we will support all but one of Senator Harradine's amendments that he is moving. But in respect of one of them, we prefer ALP amendment No. 15 before Senator Harradine's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the government's amendments, I have no conflict of interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under this section&mdash;I would call it `legislative extinguishment'&mdash;we have further bucket loads of extinguishment. On 30 October 1996, a bipartisan resolution was carried unanimously in the Commonwealth parliament on a motion by the Prime Minister. The resolution stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to . . . be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now the government wishes to violate this historical commitment by extinguishment of indigenous people's common law property right. The government's proposed division 2B goes far beyond the common law with regard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to which land tenures extinguish native title and is malicious in both intent and effect. The type of land tenures which extinguish native title under this division of the bill are contained in section 23B and the associated schedule 4 of the bill, and what good reading it makes. Presumably such acts could date back as far as 1788.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They include community purposes leases, crown to crown grants and thousands of tenures under schedule 4 on which native title may exist. But with just one vote in this chamber, it may be extinguished forever. I repeat that: extinguished forever. If division 2B is supported, it will go down as the most shameful action in this parliament's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been busy whipping up fear in the community that this provision is necessary to ensure that private freehold land cannot be subject to native title. We know that this is unnecessary. This division explains why the government has been busy making outrageous comments about private freehold land being subject to native title; that is, because the government wants to cloud its attempt in this division to go far beyond the common law and attempt to deliberately deceive both the public and senators in this chamber. This division is entitled `Confirmation of past extinguishment of native title' when what it actually entails is nothing like confirmation; rather it represents a massive overreach to extinguish native title on public lands where native title may and should exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community purpose leases which are to extinguish native title by virtue of this section may not, in common law, give exclusive possession and, following the Wik decision, may allow for native title to coexist. In addition, this category of extinguishing tenures in the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  was not foreshadowed in the 10&hyphen;point plan. Of particular concern to those like myself from Western Australia is that grants from one government to another, for example, from state government to the Commonwealth or from state government to a statutory authority, will extinguish native title by virtue of this provision, even though the use of the land may be consistent with coexistence of native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10492"> title. At the very least, the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle should apply to such grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for those in this chamber to realise that crown to crown grants are expressly excluded from extinguishing native title in the current act, yet the actions of this government, if supported, will extinguish native title on this government controlled land forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Division 2B will extinguish native title on hundreds of crown to crown grants carried out in Western Australia over the past three years. A classic example of the potential injustice of this provision is in relation to the Wawarra native title claim in far north Western Australia. A very large part of this native title area is a military training area which was created by a crown to crown grant. The area is an extensive area of bushland used only occasionally by the military, and there is a strong existing attachment to the land by the traditional owners. Under the government's provisions, native title will be extinguished in this area forever. How can this be considered fair? How can the Senate consider the issue of native title with any shred of decency and allow such a gross injustice to take place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been written about the government's infamous schedule 4 list of leases and the many other interests which will be extinguished by operation of division 2B. This list has been compiled following recommendations from the state and territories in line with their understanding of whether the common law confers exclusive possession and therefore extinguishes native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know how wrong state governments&mdash;and, in particular, the Western Australian government&mdash;can be in their interpretation of the common law with regard to native title. The Court government, as I have mentioned before, wasted millions of dollars on ludicrous High Court challenges, challenging the Native Title Act 1993. Since then it has lost two other High Court cases related to native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Senator Minchin jumps to his feet to invoke his mantra that the Commonwealth carefully vetted all the land tenures in this schedule, let me also say that we all know that the Western Australian state government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has played a big role in drafting this bill, a fact that Richard Court has confirmed on a number of occasions. Even the senators on the other side of the chamber will admit that the Premier of Western Australia has done, and will do, everything in his power to destroy the native title process. By contrast, indigenous Australians were not party to any of the discussions relating to the compilation of the schedule and, despite numerous requests for information as to the process and the outcome, they did not even see the list of so&hyphen;called schedule interests until 17 August when they were asked for comments in a matter of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to discuss the schedule in a little more depth and, in particular, its effect on Western Australia. The government have listed a whole lot of lease categories with no released idea of the basis upon which these decisions were made. To quote from the National Indigenous Working Group submission to the parliamentary committee on native title:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exercise undertaken resembles that of a client seeking advice from a lawyer as to his or her obligations as a lessee under a lease. No responsible and competent lawyer would consider giving such advice without having a copy of the document. In a similar vein, no assurance as to the legal effect of the interests listed in the schedule should be treated as having any claim to be a responsible expression of legal opinion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One wonders what those who criticise the High Court after the judgment in the Wik case would have said if they had learnt that the court had handed down its judgment without bothering to obtain copies of the relevant leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the land tenures listed in the schedule in Western Australia. Take, for example, non&hyphen;pastoral leasehold areas. Leasehold in Western Australia, other than pastoral tenures, comprises approximately 72,500 square kilometres, an area larger than Tasmania. Almost all such leases have been included in the schedule, notwithstanding that some include reservation clauses and may not grant exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are tillage leases issued under the land regulations of 1851. These leases were issued for a term of eight years and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10493"> apparently, included broad reservations including full right to the Aboriginal natives to enter on any such part of the said premises to `seek subsistence therefrom to their accustomed manner'. Nevertheless, the schedule deems that these leases extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at leases ancillary to mining tenements. Both under the Native Title Act and the bill, the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies to mining tenements. Nevertheless, the schedule includes a number of leases which are ancillary to mining. For example, item 34(10) includes leases for the purposes of a plant for the treatment of mineral bearing earth and the treatment of ore. Items 34(2) and 34(12) refer to section 1528 of the Land Act 1898 and section 1168 of the Land Act 1933, which provide for the lease of areas for the purpose of general engineering works. Items 34(3) and 34(13) dealing with a large number of purposes gazetted for special leases under section 152 of the Land Act of 1898 and section 168 of the Land Act of 1933 may apply to leases associated with the mining industry. For example, item 34(13) refers to residence and the storage of mining equipment. Item 36 states that almost all leases issued pursuant to state development acts will be associated with mining in some manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The listing of these items in the schedule is inconsistent with the principle that non&hyphen;extinguishment principles apply to mining matters. With respect to leases granted pursuant to state development agreements, in Western Australia large&hyphen;scale mining projects are often supported by specific legislation which specifies an agreement reached between the state and the developer. These agreements authorise the grant of leases for a range of purposes associated with mining. The schedule specifies that all such leases extinguish native title, apparently without specific consideration of individual leases granted under the scheme. For example, clause 9 of the Hamersley Range iron ore agreement of 1963 enables the grant of leases, rights, mining tenements, easements, reserves and licences. The schedule ensures that native title is extinguished by all such leases without any examination as to whether exclusive possession was granted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have crown to crown grants for defence purposes. As in the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth owns large areas of land in Western Australia for defence purposes. This includes a large vacant military training area north of Derby in the Kimberley region. Indigenous people retain a strong traditional connection to this land. The bill ensures that native title rights are extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community purpose leases may not grant exclusive possession and on Wik principles may allow native title to coexist. The definition of a community purpose lease is extremely wide, covering leases whose primary purpose is for community, religious, education, charitable and sporting purposes. My particular favourite amongst the list is `reserve for the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffalos'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a disgraceful way for governments to be putting together something so important regarding the impacts of legislative extinguishment of native title. There is no indication of how they have reached it or on what basis. Quite frankly, so many of these leases, from a commonsense point of view, should not be involved with extinguishment of native title. I would like an explanation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most extraordinary decision by the ALP in this whole issue and debate is their decision not to confirm extinguishment by grants of exclusive possession and to leave the enormous uncertainty that flows from such a decision, although I note that the ALP has now decided that, despite the rhetoric we have just heard from Senator Bolkus, they do think it is a good idea to confirm the extinguishment of native title on freehold land. If I am not to read this opposition amendment, which has been circulated in your name, as a furphy, I take it now to be the case that you do agree that we should legislatively extinguish native title on freehold land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, these provisions confirm that on the 13 per cent of Australia that is freehold land and on the 7.7 per cent of Australia that is under exclusive tenure, under exclusive lease, extinguishment has occurred. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10494"> confirming that 79 per cent of Australia is open to native title claim and in the other 21 per cent, where grants of exclusive possession have occurred, native title has been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a point at which we have to end the uncertainty. This is that point. We have just had the area of Australia over which native title may have survived doubled by the Wik decision. Now it is being suggested that we should leave the other 21 per cent completely open and uncertain as to what the real legal situation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you in relation to this whole area that there is not one pastoral lease on the schedule of exclusive tenures. With respect to the 42 per cent of Australia that is pastoral lease land&mdash;including the western division of New South Wales where, as you know, the farmers argued passionately that their leases were grants of exclusive possession&mdash;we did not put them on the schedule; there is not one pastoral lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now being put to us that native title may have survived on at least the 7.7 per cent covered by exclusive agricultural leases, residential leases and commercial leases. We take it from this amendment that you are accepting that on the 13 per cent of Australia where there is freehold land we should confirm extinguishment there and end the uncertainty, but on the 7.7 per cent of Australia that is covered under the schedule and is land covered by exclusive leases, you are leaving the whole thing up in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Either native title has been extinguished there and you are prepared to agree that we should confirm that by legislation or you are saying&mdash;which is presumably what you are saying&mdash;that native title may have survived on all those leases, including the agricultural leases. That is an extraordinary situation to put all those lessees in. You are now saying that they could well have native title claims made over them, they could well all be dragged into court to defend their leases against native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are leaving the act in a situation where there is no future act regime to govern future activity on land on which you are now saying to us that native title may have survived, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because that is what is now required of you. If that is the Labor Party's position, you are now required, as a responsible party in the parliament, to put forward a future act regime to govern future activity on all those leases because you think native title may have survived on them. Therefore, you are saying the Native Title Act does apply on all that land, yet the Native Title Act now, even under all our amendments, is silent on what should govern future activity on all that area. You are creating another legal nightmare, another area of extraordinary legal uncertainty, by your actions in not accepting this confirmation regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to us perfectly sensible and reasonable to confirm what is the law&mdash;that is, where grants of exclusive possession occur, native title is extinguished; otherwise you find the legal quagmire I just described.

<PARA STYLE="Para">As to the state of the law, let me read what Chief Justice Brennan said on this matter in the Wik decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course native title is not an estate and to treat native title as falling into possession on the determination of a prior estate is to create problems of title not easy to resolve. If the holders of native title were recognised as the owners of an estate in remainder in the land, could the priority right to a selection enjoyed by a lessee be exercised and would the holders of native title have become liable to pay for the improvements to the land effected during the expired lease? To what extent was the discretion to enforce a forfeiture against a lessee affected by this proposed subsistence of native title in the land? In the unusual event of the determination of estate in fee&hyphen;simple, would the land revert to the Crown or would it be taken by the holders of native title? These questions indicate some of the problems that arise once the fundamental 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10495"> doctrines that govern the title to land granted by the Crown under the 1910 act are departed from. In my opinion, the common law could not recognise native title once the Crown alienated a freehold or leasehold estate under the act. Consequently, the common law is powerless to recognise native title as reviving after the determination of a pastoral lease issued under the 1910 act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was stating quite clearly, as the Chief Justice, the lead judge in Mabo, the extraordinary dangers and legal uncertainty that flow from any notion that extinguishment is not permanent. The High Court has not ruled that extinguishment is not permanent. We take the common law to be as Chief Justice Brennan has stated it, and we draw to your attention the legal consequences of that not being the case, as he has described there; and as your former leader in this chamber said, `Extinguishment means extinguishment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court would not have used the term `extinguishment' if it did not mean that. Extinguishment means to make extinct. If they meant suppression, suspension or something else, they would have said so. The court case says `extinguishment' and extinguishment can mean only one thing. The legal dangers and uncertainty that flow from any notion of revival are very dangerous for the legal system of this country and for property law in this country. As I say, Chief Justice Brennan has summarised it in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe this is one of the most important parts of this bill. It is essential that we end the uncertainty flowing from the question of whether native title may or may not have survived on these things. We say the common law is clear&mdash;that where grants of exclusive possession have occurred, native title is extinguished, but we think it is the responsibility of this parliament to confirm that in this legislation.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Court has not determined that the extinguishment is not permanent. What the High Court has done is left open that question of permanent extinguishment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing here is going further than the common law. You are going further than Wik. Basically you are acquiring people's property in a racist, discriminatory manner. Do you know who else says that? It is not just the opposition who says that. We can tender document after document, and we could also refer you to the advice of 25 July this year from your Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester, who raised this particular area as one of the three primary areas of concern when it comes to a breach of the RDA and our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, we do not need to embark upon an inflammatory scare campaign on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice is that it is a clubhouse in Queensland. It is a grant of exclusive possession. There is a club on it and there are Australians who belong to such an order. They are entitled to the protection of the law, based on the fact that that was a grant of exclusive possession, along with every other lease that is included in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to enormous lengths to very conservatively put together this list on the basis that it contains only those leases which are grants of exclusive possession. It does not include one pastoral lease. We are talking about only 7.7 per cent of Australia that is covered by these leases. We think it is very carefully checked. We did not accept the proposition that we put in Western Division leases, to the great aggravation of the New South Wales farmers, who believe very strongly that their leases are grants of exclusive possession. I think that is the test of the merit of this list. We are talking about a small proportion of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are saying that native title may have survived on any one or all of those, there are 60,000 separate leases here. If you are saying every one of those is subject to native title claim and every one of those must seek somehow to comply with the Native Title Act, for fear that anything they do would be illegal because they have not complied with the Native Title Act, you are going to put us right back where we started with Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the whole thing. You went out of your way to say, `Pastoral leases are extinguished; you can do what you like; everything is fine.' Now we have this mess of 26,000 leases that were issued in relation to pastoral leases on the understanding of what the law was. We have an invalidity problem that we are trying to resolve. You will end up in exactly the same situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor people with their clubhouse&mdash;whatever they are called&mdash;will not know whether they can build a barbecue outside if they want to do so. Is it possible under the Native Title Act? They will have to go to their lawyers and ask their lawyers whether, under the Native Title Act, they can do this. They have been told by you that the native 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> title may have survived there. That means the Native Title Act must be taken account of and you can only do it validly and safely if you comply with the Native Title Act. There may be no way to do it under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to go down this path, you have to responsibly provide a whole regime for future acts on all those leases, including the grand order of whatever in relation to their clubhouse. That is the dilemma you face.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to go down this path and say, `We mustn't do it because native title may have survived'&mdash;and we are talking on the basis that we know it may have survived on 79 per cent, but you are saying it may have survived on the rest as well&mdash;where is your future act regime to ensure that these people are not put in the position that you put pastoral lessees in? You really have a big responsibility here and you have to meet it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I made earlier was that Senator Minchin cannot have it both ways. He claims that all he is doing here is confirming extinguishment where extinguishment has happened under the common law. He goes on to say that we need to give certainty where there may not be. The other thing that is important is that we are actually talking about historic leases as well. The government's initial proposal here was to cover historic leases&mdash;leases that may have been issued a hundred years ago under law lease categories, not specific leases. The leases may never have been taken up. In many cases the leases have expired. There is no&hyphen;one there; the land becomes vacant crown land. What does Senator Minchin say in that respect? He says, `Despite the fact that that might have happened, native title can still be extinguished and is extinguished.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are basically driftnet fishing with this particular proposal. You are going further than the common law, and you know it. That is precisely why you are running these lines to try to scare people. You are running further than the common law. You are trying to pick up anything that might have happened over the last hundred years or so. You are picking up the ghost leases&mdash;the historic leases. As a consequence, you might be concerned about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10498"> club owners, and so are we, but we are also concerned about indigenous Australians whose rights might be unfairly taken away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know who else is concerned about that? Your Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester. That is exactly why he identified this as being one of the important areas that breached the Racial Discrimination Act and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is exactly why he mentioned it there, and this will be one of the first proposals that will be up for grabs in the High Court under the races power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, you cannot have it both ways. I thank my colleagues here for the note that has really distracted me from what I was saying. Senator Minchin, you cannot have it both ways. What you are trying to do is to scare people. You know very well that, where native title has been extinguished, you go further than that. In terms of uncertainty, the people who are actually stimulating uncertainty in this community&mdash;and I have got to say that it is a case of shooting yourselves in the foot&mdash;are the people out there in rural Australia, telling pastoralists that there is a degree of uncertainty as to their interests in land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been the line that has been run. On Sunday night, we saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying to the nation that this is a matter of national importance and urgency and that we have got to protect the rights of pastoralists. Today, in the last 24 hours or so, he is running the line that there is no need to have the right to negotiate over pastoral leases because, after all, Wik determined that pastoralists' interests in fact overrule&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All we have at the moment, Senator Margetts, is the common law which we understand to provide that grants of exclusive possession extinguish native title. The problem with the Wik judgment is that what it said was, basically, you have got to go through every lease and work out whether it is a grant of exclusive possession&mdash;meaning potentially. While it appears clear on the face of it that it is a grant of exclusive possession, we take it to be, therefore, extinguishing, and that is our understanding of the common law. Community purpose leases are grants of exclusive possession and therefore extinguish native title, so we have assembled this list on a very conservative basis of putting on it those leases that
