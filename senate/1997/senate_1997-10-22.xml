<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak with respect to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S144">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> . I wish to put on record a number of factors. Firstly, the opposition does not have a problem with this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does or does not?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does not. We believe this bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act to give effect to some decisions announced by the government with respect to X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated programs on narrowcasting services. They were measures that were announced in April 1997 by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), as well as the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Daryl Williams).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated programming is banned on subscription broadcasting services and on free to air services. However, with respect to narrowcasting services, our understanding is that those services limited in availability or appeal are not prevented from providing X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated programming. That, of course, is certain narrowcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also finding that, increasingly, pay TV companies are offering extra channels of specialised programming, and doing so through this broadening range of narrowcasting services. Amongst those channels we have companies which do have and do want to broadcast explicitly sexual material, which mainstream television free to air services are prohibited from showing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has raised a policy issue for all sides of the parliament. The government tackled it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in April this year, and the opposition I think made it clear at the time that we had no problems with the government's announced direction. The government decided to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to prohibit programs that have been refused classification, or which had been classified as X on subscription television narrowcasting services and also on open free to air narrowcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also decided to apply to open narrowcasting services the same restrictions regarding R&hyphen;rated programs as currently apply to commercial TV broadcasting services. These include such things as modification of R&hyphen;rated films to comply with the previous adults only classification, and restrictions as to what hours during which M and MA material may be broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting aspect of the government's decision was with respect to R&hyphen;rated material on subscription television narrowcasting services. The opposition announced at the time that it would also support that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Harradine interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This then raises the second part of what I wanted to say this morning. We were asked just a few days ago whether we had any problems with the cut&hyphen;off being lifted with respect to this legislation. We agreed to that. Given the government's need to try and get some legislation through before Christmas&mdash;and recognising that this legislation was such that we, on this side, did not have a major policy difference with it&mdash;we agreed to that. But we are, I must say, quite surprised to find that, less than 24 hours after such request was made to us, this legislation was listed for debate yesterday afternoon. We did not get to it yesterday afternoon&mdash;it was to be first debated yesterday, but workplace relations intervened&mdash;but it was curious that this bill was listed so quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other curious aspect of the government's announcement was the way the government tried to portray its decision as something new, something radical and something which&mdash;as announced at the time by the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;showed that the government was tough on X&hyphen;rated and R&hyphen;rated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7782"> programming which may involve sexually explicit material. The truth of the matter is that, despite the spin in the Attorney&hyphen;General's statement, despite the spin in the joint ministerial statement and despite the backgrounding of the media, very little had changed in the context of the whole decision. That needs to be placed on the record as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public, to a certain extent, was conned. The public was conned deliberately by the ministers and, as a consequence, families in Australia thought, through the spin doctors, that the government had intervened to remove from the airwaves certain material. So we do not see the government really acting with totally clean hands on this issue. But, as I said at the outset, with respect to the fundamentals of the decision&mdash;as I think is widely known&mdash;we do not have a policy problem with them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have heard from the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S49">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act so that the prohibition in relation to the broadcasting of programs that have been either refused classification&mdash;and, of course, the Democrats agree that programs that have been refused classification should not be shown on broadcast, narrowcast, free to air or any television program&mdash;or those that have been classified as X, which relates to commercial television and subscription television broadcasters, will now also apply to open narrowcasting services or a subscription television narrowcasting service. The bill seeks to apply not only to X&hyphen;rated material but also to those programs which have received an R rating by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find it quite fascinating that the government has introduced this legislation. The Broadcasting Services Act distinguishes between broadcasting services&mdash;those programs intended to appeal to the general public&mdash;and narrowcasting services. Those are the programs whose reception is limited through specialised program appeal or is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restricted in some other way. Currently, material rated X and R is prohibited on free to air commercial television broadcasting services and on subscription television broadcasting services, but there are no such restrictions on narrowcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government stated that there is widespread community concern about X&hyphen;rated material on television narrowcasting services. I have received very little correspondence in my office about this matter. I tend to believe that, in fact, it is something to do with the government internally&mdash;particularly the Lyons Forum&mdash;which has been pressing for a legislative solution to the broadcasting of X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have also decided that open narrowcasting services should be subject to the same level of regulation in respect of R&hyphen;rated programs as is applied to commercial broadcasting services. The reason they give for this decision is that children can readily access open narrowcasting services. Firstly, I do not think the government are giving enough credit to those many hundreds of thousands of responsible parents who, themselves, can police their children and supervise viewing habits. Secondly, they discount the fact that much of this material is available in any video hire store, and the material that goes onto this channel that is not available in a video hire store is available through the mail from the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is highly interventionist, and it was drafted by a non&hyphen;interventionist government&mdash;or that is what they tell us they are. Let me remind the Senate of the current provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act. At section 123(1), it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the intention of the Parliament that radio and television industry groups . . . develop, in consultation with the ABA . . . codes of practice that are to be applicable to the broadcasting operations of each of those sections of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ASTRA&mdash;the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association&mdash;has recently developed, through extensive consultation, codes of practice which relate to the broadcasting of X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated material. These codes have been registered with the ABA, as is required under the act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7783">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the ABA, as the industry regulator, is required under the act to review the operation of subsection 123(3A) to determine whether this subsection is in accordance with community standards. The report of the ABA, together with any recommendations, is to be tabled by the minister in both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving those recommendations. That is a very important issue, and perhaps the minister can tell us where that report is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation pre&hyphen;judges the ABA's review. This legislation assumes that the community standards have changed and that the act now needs amendment. But how can we know this when the minister has not reported to parliament and when we have not seen the report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue then is not about the need to further regulate an industry which the government is assuming should act like free to air broadcasters when, clearly, its establishment was to provide broadcasting services directed to particular audiences wanting access to programs which the free to air broadcasters could not provide but which, in this case, could be provided by going to the video store. And, since the codes deal with all the matters raised in the bill in identical terms, the issue is about one of perceived compliance of the industry by the government to those codes of practice. The minister should provide the ABA's report immediately so the parliament can realistically and properly determine the need for amending legislation&mdash;before this amending legislation is voted on&mdash;and determine its needs in the context of current and future technological developments: cable, satellite and other technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats oppose the restriction of material to adults that would be generally acceptable to responsible adults. Further, if that material is granted classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, then, arguably, there is no need to subject that material to further censorship and to further regulation across narrowcasting services&mdash;especially when those services offer filtering and other blocking devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats support an independent complaints handling body which is adequately 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resourced, has powers to investigate complaints and is empowered to enforce its decisions, and we also support the codes of practice. In relation to codes of practice, the Australian Democrats believe that codes of practice should be enforceable and should be overseen by an independent body which is adequately resourced, has powers to investigate complaints and is empowered to enforce its decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed in the position on this matter of the opposition, who have agreed to pass this legislation on the basis of previous party policy. Certainly, from what I can gather, the industry was not consulted by either of the major parties on this, and that is hardly the way to develop sound policy, or particularly, good law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry now faces having to amend its newly registered codes of practice and to negotiate those again&mdash;right from scratch&mdash;through the ABA. That is after the very extensive consultation process with the industry, the public and regulatory agencies over the last two years, which resulted in the recently registered codes of practice. Having worked long and hard to secure an agreed outcome on these issues related to violence in the media, as outlined in section 123(3) of the Broadcasting Services Act, the industry and the ABA now have&mdash;or at least had&mdash;a common understanding of what was required of everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill puts into motion a process that will undermine the codes before they have even had the opportunity to operate and before a review process was undertaken to determine their effectiveness. The Democrats are opposed to the bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to say anything in the debate at the second reading stage because it is my intention to ask the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) a number of questions in the committee stage. I hope the minister will be able to respond on behalf of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions in the  Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  go some way towards overcoming a problem which was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7784"> created by the ABA itself and which was quite contrary to the legislative intent of amendments that went into the Broadcasting Services Act and were supposed to have been upheld. But I will be asking those questions of the minister and I hope to get some response from him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason I am standing here is to make the comment that I was quite surprised by the previous contribution made by Senator Bourne. It shows that Senator Bourne, who was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies, has somehow or other changed her view as described in the various reports. I must say that I did not expect to have to respond as such. Suffice to say that, in Part 1 of the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Report on R&hyphen;rated material on pay TV</EMPHASIS>, part (1) of the recommendations that were made by the Senate select committee reads as follows:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not canvass all the arguments because I think they have already been traversed, and they will be again in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Harradine is probably referring to the first report on R&hyphen;rated material on pay TV where the committee recommended that R&hyphen;rated material be not permitted. Senator Bourne was, of course, a member of that committee that always assumed that X would remain banned on pay TV, and went further to a position beyond which the government is not able to go. I think Senator Harradine is also referring to part 2 of the report, which similarly recommended that measures be taken to prevent the broadcasting of X&hyphen; and R&hyphen;rated material on pay TV. The membership of that committee included Senator Woodley from the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Harradine is simply making the point that the Democrats seem to have made a pretty monumental backflip on all this. No doubt Senator Bourne will have the opportunity to deal with these matters later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far the ABA report is concerned, I am not sure to which one Senator Bourne is referring because there have been a number. But, if it is the one in relation to the Broadcasting Services Act, my advice is that that really only relates to planning and does not deal with these issues. Obviously these issues have to be assessed, taking into account the report of the Senate select committee and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7785"> other sources of material that are available to all politicians&mdash;not just lobbying by the industry. I do not recall ever being lobbied by people like Eros; I think they have stayed well clear of me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me respond to a couple of things that have been said. First of all, the original report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies, to which both Senator Harradine and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) have referred, was one which was talking about pay TV broadcasts, subscription television services, and not the narrowcast television services which are only to apply to small sections of the community&mdash;or at least that is my understanding of it. I do not have the report in front of me but from memory, and it was a while ago, that is what we were talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, let me respond to what Senator Harradine says is a valid accusation&mdash;that I am facilitating the spread of hard&hyphen;core porn through pay TV. I think that is a thoroughly non-valid accusation on Senator Harradine's behalf. This does not facilitate any such thing. It applies only if somebody has paid to get a specific service on their television&mdash;it does not force anybody to watch anything; it is not forcing children to watch anything. I would most certainly hope that parents are able to make sure that their children do not watch R&hyphen;rated videos that they get from the video store and leave hanging around. I would certainly hope that parents have the sense not to do that. If they have the sense not to do that, then I would certainly hope that they also have the sense not to allow children to watch 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a narrowcast service&mdash;if they have put it on, which they do not have to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the whole point of this legislation is that there are codes of practice which have been developed by the industry in consultation with the community. I understand what the minister is doing but I would quite like a response on this. There are codes of practice which have been developed by the industry after extensive community consultation over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of these codes of practice&mdash;this is the main point of this bill&mdash;is now about to be invalidated by an act of parliament, even though the minister has not put out a report about that code of practice. He has not explained why the code of practice does not have community standards in mind. What is wrong with the code of practice? Why did two years of community consultation result in a code of practice that does not reflect the wishes of the community? What is wrong with that code of practice? Why does the validation of that code of practice now have to be stopped by an act of parliament? That is the main question about this bill. I would really like to hear an answer from the minister on this question now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not at all clear on what Senator Bourne is referring to. The fact is that, as provided for in the Broadcasting Services Act, four codes have been registered with the ABA and those codes came into effect on 12 September. They refer to television subscription narrowcasting; television open narrowcasting, which is effectively the sixth channel; radio subscription narrowcasting; and radio open narrowcasting. Those codes ban the broadcast of programs classified X or refused classification, restrict access to R&hyphen;rated materials to those with appropriate disabling devices, restrict services devoted predominantly to adult erotica to late&hyphen;night access only. In effect, those codes comply in anticipation of this legislation passing the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure what Senator Bourne is referring to when she talks about some code that has been around for a couple of years and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7786"> which is now out the window. If she is talking about television open narrowcasting, then there is a code which effectively does what this bill will do. I am happy to respond if Senator Bourne can give me details of the code to which she is referring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that R&hyphen;rated material has always been banned on pay TV. That was taken by the ABA to refer only to broadcast pay TV and, as I understand it, the two reports of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies were effectively dealing with narrowcast pay TV. What Senator Harradine is now pointing out is that both of those reports advocated the extension of the ban on R&hyphen;rated materials&mdash;in other words, R&hyphen;rated was not allowed on normal pay TV. These reports simply went one step further and said that R&hyphen;rated materials should not be allowed on narrowcast pay TV either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in the wake of the ABA identifying some of these late&hyphen;night services as narrowcasting&mdash;therefore in a separate category&mdash;and saying that it was not covered by the current legislative prohibition which only applies to broadcast. The Senate committee report wanted that extension covered. This  Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , in effect, validates the ABA decision. On that basis, I do not quite follow Senator Bourne's explanation as to why her recommendation that R&hyphen;rated material be not permitted on pay TV was not clearly intended to apply to narrowcasting, which I think is clearly Senator Harradine's position.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish I had that report in front of me but, unfortunately, I do not. As far as I recall the report to which the minister is referring&mdash;R&hyphen;rated material is and was banned on normal broadcast pay TV&mdash;we were looking at whether or not that was a reasonable point of view.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister made a point in relation to the codes of practice. When he was reading out the code of practice, I think I heard him say&mdash;I did not write it down, and I would appreciate it if he would let me know&mdash;that R&hyphen;rated material should be allowed on a channel if it could be disabled somehow, or a term such as that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, it is the second report of the Senate select committee that is probably more relevant to the context of the debate that has been going on at that end of the building, because it is post the ABA decision. That is the one that Senator Harradine would point to as calling for a ban on the broadcasting of R&hyphen;rated material through pay TV across the board&mdash;in other words, through broadcast and narrowcast. That is the one to which Senator Woodley has attached his signature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the current codes are concerned, those that have been lodged with the ABA came into effect on 12 September. The pay TV narrowcasting codes restrict access to R&hyphen;rated material to those with appropriate disabling devices. That was essentially one of the matters that led the ABA to decide that this was a narrowcast service even though, as far as the customers were concerned, superficially, if you walked into the room, turned on the television and operated it as a pay TV outlet, you were able to get something that you could get on other channels just as easily. In this instance, you have to specifically subscribe, you need a pin number and, of course, it is a late night service. On that basis the ABA said that that distinguishes it sufficiently, makes it a narrowcast operation and it ought to be treated differently. Therefore, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7787"> the act adopts the ABA distinction and the codes now comply with that approach as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me have a look. Senator Woodley was the Democrat representative at that stage but you had signed the previous one which I read out. I thought you were still on at that particular time. Nevertheless, that appeared to be a unanimous decision. In fact, it was a unanimous decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, that entrenched, as it were, the statement that was made in regard to subscription television services, pay TV. We were talking about pay TV. We knew what pay TV was. What I am asking the minister now is how can he endorse what the ABA has done to him and to us&mdash;that is, the legislators? The ABA knew jolly well what we meant. How can he allow them to get away with what they have got away with&mdash;in other words, to describe what in any terms is pay TV as a narrowcasting service? And they did that at the behest of you know who&mdash;a very influential media magnate in this country who is a part owner of the particular service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to the minister that the parliament deserves somewhat more from the people who serve it, such as the ABA, than what has occurred thus far. Parliament made its decision that there should not be R or X&hyphen;rated material on pay TV. The ABA knew what it was doing. It got around that by defining that as narrowcast. I put to the minister that that is something that he should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7788"> have regard to because of the implications of it. If you allow them to get away with it on this occasion, you are going to allow them to get away with it on other occasions&mdash;such as with the Internet, for example.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear from the minister why the ABA chose to define pay TV as narrowcasting.

Taking up Senator Bourne's point, we are talking about hard core porn and other stuff, including violent stuff, being beamed directly into the homes of Australian families. Where is the guarantee that only adults are in control of this situation? Where is the verification? These are the sorts of things that you have to think about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that this is a difficult issue and that there will be strong differences of opinion in the community. Indeed, until Galaxy started to show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Night Moves</EMPHASIS> , there was not an issue about the distinction between broadcast and narrowcast pay TV. They effectively approached the ABA for an opinion as to whether, given the restricted basis on which access could be had to this service, it should be treated differently to run&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;mill pay TV channels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABA took the view that, because it was late night&mdash;11 to four, I think&mdash;and because it required the use of a pin number, that would mean that those watching it would not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accidentally come across it; that they would have to exercise a choice and, in so doing, there would be the capacity for adults to effectively ensure that children were not able to access the pin number. Even though adults might have difficulty in forcing children to go to bed early, the later the hour of night the less likely it is that young people will be up watching any form of television. So on that basis, the ABA gave that opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the course of events, the Senate select committee then had a second inquiry. As Senator Harradine rightly points out, the members of that committee were unanimous in expressing what were in effect their personal views. The process that was followed in this regard was no different from the process followed in relation to virtually all other reports. Members of the various parties on those committees hear the evidence, form their own judgments, report back to the parties, and, in the case of the government party, a decision is finally made as to government policy, taking into account the view of the committee&mdash;not just, in this instance, the views of the Liberal and National party members but the fact that it was a unanimous committee report. That caused the government to think very hard about where the line ought to be drawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no truck, of course, with hard core pornography and there has never been any suggestion that that should be allowed on free to air or pay television of any sort. The argument is really in relation to&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has always been a distinction between X rated and R rated. If you want to argue that R is no better or worse than X and run the two together and say they are both hard core porn, then I will couch the argument in another way and say to you that we have never been prepared to countenance X, which we regard as a harder form. But in this instance the government took the view that you need to draw a policy balance be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7789"> tween the rights of individuals to view entertainment services of their choice and the community's very understandable and commendable desire to ensure that some unacceptable material is not widely and indiscriminately available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, having considered the views of the Senate committee, the government has taken the view that it is possible to accommodate the concerns of all sides of the debate by effectively limiting access in the ways that the ABA endorsed. If that is the case, then those who will be watching that service will be watching it because they choose to watch it; because they pay to watch it&mdash;in some instances they will be paying premium prices to watch it; they will have to stay up late at night to watch it; and they will have to go through a particular process, which is clearly an informed consent. It is not simply coming across it late at night. They are making a conscious and deliberate choice to actually get up and key in their PIN number and subscribe specifically. It is like a pay per view service. On that basis the government has taken the view that the balance is correctly struck in this way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very interested in what the minister just said. It is quite significant that he made that comment in respect of R and X ratings. The simple fact of the matter is that, as the joint committee on video materials observed, the R&hyphen;rated porn material is the same in many of the videos. It is the same title, the same content, the same intent, generating the same callous and manipulative orientation towards women as the X&hyphen;rated equivalent, save only that they have been taken from different camera angles. That is interesting, isn't it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the minister knew that. If he had been properly informed and advised as to what is contained in the reports, he would have known that. If he is suggesting that the distinction between hard core and soft core is just the camera angle and does not go to the heart of the matter, that is, is the intent of the material and the content, then he is not the sort of straightforward minister and thinking person that I thought. The joint 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee found that all of the material was likely to have an effect on the habitual viewer. It is all there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston indicates that these are personal views expressed by members of the committee. Perhaps we ought to go to who the committee members were who recommended that this type of R&hyphen;rated material, as well as violent R&hyphen;rated material that is available, should not be on pay television and specifically said that it should not be on the narrowcast, because they had already said that it should not be on the broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hear who the people concerned are. Senator Tierney was the chairman. The deputy chair was Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds from the Labor Party. The members were Senator Denman, Senator Harradine, Senator Knowles, Senator McGauran, Senator Troeth and Senator Woodley. Those recommendations were made after hearings undertaken by the committee. Let me make it clear that the government, the opposition and, it appears now, the Democrats are opposed to that unanimous recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with my next point by going to the legislation that is before us. Schedule 1 part 6 of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes to amend clause 11 of schedule 2 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an open narrowcasting television service under a class licence is also subject to the following conditions:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine is correct on the last point. When the state attorneys&hyphen;general have concluded their discussions on the new regime proposed by the Attorney&hyphen;General, it will presumably be necessary to amend that provision to ensure that the nomenclature is consistent. That is dealing simply with what in colloquial terms is called community television&mdash;in other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7790"> words, the sixth channel. It is a free to air service rather than a pay TV service. It is simply extending the provisions that currently govern free to air commercial television to what is currently a free to air community service. It is saying that all free to air television ought to be subject to the same rules. That will continue to be the case even when there are changes made to the X classification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will respond to Senator Harradine's point about the distinction between X and R. I start by bowing to his superior knowledge on the subject. He has brought this point to my attention before. It may well be the case that you not only have the same titles and the same content but also have the same actors and the same non&hyphen;story line. In other words, it is the same film shoot, but you have different camera angles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is saying that on the supply side the difference is non-existent but on the demand side, the viewer side, the depictions are fundamentally different. They are required to be different because X is regarded as harder core than R and the different camera angles are intended to reflect that fact. The end result is that what the viewer sees is a lesser form as a result of the R restrictions. That is the intention of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not so much directed to telling film producers and directors how they should make the film and who should be involved in it&mdash;although there may be some changes in that regard with the NVE classification&mdash;but essentially directed to restricting what is available to the viewers. That is why camera angles and other means of cutting back on the explicit nature of X material is then permitted under R. It is because there is a qualitative difference as far as the viewer is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine may be quite right that it does not really make any difference to the actors who are involved. They are doing the same things. They may not even know what goes to air, what ends up on the cutting room floor or what is classified X or R. Indeed, they may not even know the difference. I suspect that they have probably not even read the Broadcasting Services Act. Our task and the intention of the parliament is to protect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the viewers and to limit what might be shown in various mediums and at various times and restrict that by reference to age groups.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is particularly edifying in this debate to be playing duelling reports, but as long as we are I point to part 3 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies. We have been talking about the other two parts. The first was signed by me. I have explained that the second was signed by Senator Woodley. The third is actually about the regulation of computer on&hyphen;line services and was signed by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are three recommendations in this third part which are relevant: firstly, that the Australian Democrats do not advocate unsuitable on&hyphen;line material being made available to minors; secondly, that we oppose the restriction of adult access to material which would generally be acceptable to reasonable adults&mdash;and that applies to narrowcast subscription television as well as to on&hyphen;line services; and, thirdly, that retailers and service providers should be encouraged to provide information to consumers about blocking and filtering devices and so on. I think that is perfectly reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two questions for the minister. Let me go back to what I think is the real point of this whole amendment&mdash;that is, section 123 part 3A of the Broadcasting Services Act, which deals with codes of practice. As we know it took two years for a code of practice to come in. It came in last month. It does substantially reflect what is in this bill. Section 123A states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The ABA must periodically conduct a review of the operation of subsection 123 (3A) to see whether that subsection is in accordance with prevailing community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If, after conducting such a review, the ABA concludes that that subsection&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the codes of practice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is not in accordance with prevailing community standards, the ABA must recommend to the Minister appropriate amendments to this Act that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7791"> would ensure that that subsection is in accordance with prevailing community standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those codes of practice have been in for only a month, maybe less&mdash;I am not sure. They came in last month. The point is that we are now changing the legislation to reflect that without having the review by the ABA of the operation of those codes of practice. The ABA has not reviewed it, so of course the minister has not put a report on the table. He does not have a report, so he cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we putting the cart before the horse? That is the question about the whole of this legislation. Why are we now changing the legislation without having the review which is actually set out in section 123A of the original Broadcasting Services Act? Secondly, is the minister aware of blocking devices which are available, or which are expected to become available in the near future, to enable people to take up that access which he says will be available if there are blocking devices on the equipment?</PARA></SPEECH>

It is entitled to do that. It lodged them as recently as 12 September. It follows from that that the ABA will have an obligation in due course to periodically review those codes of practice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the blocking technology, I think you are referring here to on-line services. We in Australia are quite well placed in terms of the standards that are available, if you compare us with the United States, for example, where they are now trying to devise what they call PICS&mdash;which I think is platform for Internet content standards. They will probably end up with something comparable to our OFLC classification. They may not be the same 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7792"> terminology, but the concept of having graduated standards for different groups or different times is one that they are currently addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that it will be possible in due course to have technologies that will enable people to subscribe to service providers who effectively build PICS into their service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go to the question raised by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) and one raised by Senator Bourne. The minister, talking about R&hyphen;rated material some minutes ago, indicated that that was not so much determined by the actors as subjectively by the viewers. I point out that the Joint Select Committee on Video Materials, at page 45 of its report, denies completely what he says. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.52<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To make the claim that the term `pornography' really refers to the subjective reactions of individuals to particular representations of sex, rather than to the representations themselves and their intent, involves a serious misuse of language. It is clear that the term `pornography' does not refer to the interior dispositions of the viewers. Both the person who experiences outrage and the person who experiences arousal of sexual desires from viewing exploitative depictions of sexual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> activities aimed at sexual arousal knows what kind of material is being referred to when they hear the term `pornography'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.53<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The term refers to the nature of the materials themselves&mdash;their content and apparent or purported intention to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now go to the question asked by the Democrats. I point out to the Democrats that the joint committee observed in its report that when the principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose was originally stated in 1973 as public policy, the number of videos entering Australia was insignificant. The widespread availability of objectionable video publications as exists today as a result of the flood of materials into Australia did not exist then. And so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we deal with these matters against the background of principle. This principle is often stated but not adhered to in practice, since adults are not free to view video material depicting, inter alia, child pornography, bestiality and sexually explicit violent pornography, as these are banned under censorship guidelines and prohibited from entry into Australia under Customs regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose is dependent upon the pornographers' claimed right to freedom of expression and the balancing of this claimed right against requirements fundamental to the common good, which legislators are bound to uphold. The issue now is not whether there should be censorship&mdash;as was the case in 1973 when the principle was first stated as public policy&mdash;but where to draw the line. The committee considers that the current line is not appropriately drawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So really the test is a question of freedom of expression. What weight do you give the pornographers' right to freedom of expression as against protection of others who may be affected by that freedom of expression? As has been stated to our committee on a number of occasions, this includes children and it includes the engendering of a callous and manipulative orientation towards women, which much of this material establishes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7794">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to now come back to the question of NVE, which I raised earlier. The minister said, in response to my question about the NVE category, that the legislation may need to be amended later on. The government said at the last election that it intended to abolish the X category. That was a promise by the government at the last election. The government said that it would abolish the X category and establish a new NVE category. Minister, if and when it does that, are we to understand that the Broadcasting Services Act will be amended to exclude the X classification and replace it with the NVE classification?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hopefully I will deal with all of Senator Harradine's points. As far as the subjective aspect is concerned, I do not for a moment take the view that pornography is in the eye of the beholder any more than I accept the proposition that there is an absolute freedom of expression. We all know the classic exception to that&mdash;Oliver Wendell Holmes saying that you do not have a right to cry fire in a crowded theatre any more than you have the right to trample on community standards and values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficult task is always where to draw the line. I myself would attach very little weight to any so-called pornographer's right to freedom of expression. I have no doubt at all that they are not in the business because somehow they want to give cultural expression to their artistic instincts. They are there to make a big fat quid and to do it as efficiently and productively as possible in commercial terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not in any shape or form looking at this through the eyes of the supplier of the service. What we are doing is looking at what actually gets to screen. That is why I say that it is not a matter of saying, `As long as you look at hard core pornography and you are not affected by it, it is not hard core pornography.' It is still hard pornography; it is just having a different effect on A as opposed to B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we try to do is to limit what is actually available to anyone, whether they are susceptible or not. When we have an R 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> classification restricted, then we are deliberately decreeing&mdash;whether it be by way of camera angles or cuts or anything else&mdash;that in the scheme of things only less offensive material can go to air irrespective of the predilections or sensitivities of the viewers themselves. So that is an objective judgment about what is able to go to air, and how viewers react to that subjectively is a matter for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we are changing this classification in terms of the Attorney-General's discussions with state colleagues is that otherwise the status quo would have continued until such time as they had reached agreement and that would have permitted open free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air narrowcast services to be effectively unregulated. We do not think that is proper. It would probably also have encouraged people like Northgate to maintain X&hyphen;rated pay TV services when we do not think that is appropriate either. So it was necessary to act as quickly as we could to close off those areas of concern. But we recognise that there will need to be consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act if a new classification regime emerges from the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all I can say to Senator Harradine is, in the scheme of things, it might have been preferable if they had already made their decisions and we could have made all these changes in one go. But given that we could not do that, I think we are moving with the necessary expedition to close off areas that we think need to be closed off. We are not going as far as Senator Harradine would prefer us to go, but that does not really affect the way in which consequential amendments will need to be dealt with.</PARA></SPEECH>

If you want to know where I want to go, I will be happy to have that discussion on a basis of principle at any time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly aware of Senator Harradine's views about the classification of non-violent erotic videos announced by the Attorney-General and in particular Senator Harradine's view that the establishment of a NVE category is not necessary to exclude demeaning material as the national classification code already states that classification decisions should exclude material which portrays people in a demeaning manner. So I think the argument is not so much whether this is for the first time putting a ban or a limitation on demeaning material; it is whether it goes further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General has indicated that, as far as the content of the new NVE classification is concerned, the details are still to be worked out with the states and the territories, but the Commonwealth will be proposing that that category would differ from the existing X category in that certain fetishes, sexually assaultive language, the portrayal of adults as minors and violence outside the sexual context would also be excluded. So it does go beyond the current definition of the X category. To the extent that it impacts upon the Broadcasting Services Act, any changes that are made will need to flow through to the BSA and affect both free to air and pay TV services.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is therefore, I think, appropriate for governments and the parliament to review the operation of a principle to see whether it is being given effect to in a way that is still regarded as consistent with community standards. You may well find in the administration of an act that those who apply it on a daily basis have a view which is not the majority view of the parliament. In those circumstances you may, indeed, change the principle or you may attach further guidelines or boundaries to make it clear that you have a different view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Harradine is well aware, this matter is the responsibility of the Attorney&hyphen;General; therefore, I am not even in a position to have advice provided to me about the nature and extent of the current regime and what currently falls within it.

Others may have taken the view that this material should not be regarded as demeaning, but the Commonwealth has taken the view that it should.

As a result, there would be a tighter set of guidelines that would further limit material that could be regarded as demeaning.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister did not respond to my request. I repeat the request because it is an essential part of this debate and it will certainly be a part of the forthcoming debates on IT. I would like him to provide to me the view of the government on the meaning of the word `demeaning'. I am talking about `demeaning' in the context of the national classification code which requires those responsible to have regard to community concerns about the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner. The new draft guidelines state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of demeaning spelt out in the code applies in making decisions across all of the classification categories. It refers to depictions, directly or indirectly sexual in nature which debase or appear to debase the person or the character depicted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the crucial word in interpreting the meaning of `demeaning' is `debase'. For what it is worth, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>  defines `debase' as `lower in quality, value or character' and it defines `demean' as `lower the dignity or status of'. Obviously, the concept of human dignity is of great relevance and has a powerful meaning under a whole host of international conventions and human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be quite frank, over the years that I have been interested in these matters I have not seen much thoughtful material from a philosophical point of view emanating from the Attorney-General's specific area on this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular matter&mdash;or from the OFLC for that matter. We have now reached a watershed. It appears that the government has no confidence in the OFLC's view of what is demeaning&mdash;that is what all this boils down to&mdash;it appears that the government has absolutely no confidence either in those responsible for this area in the Attorney-General's Department or in the OFLC in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again reiterate my request that I be provided with a considered view by the government on the question of where they think `demeaning' applies to the current R and X categories and what ought to go&mdash;beyond what the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has said in trying to make the best of what he presumably feels is a bad deal of the government's commitment to ban X.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask a further question about paragraph 6 of schedule 1 where it says that the licensee will not broadcast films that are classified as R&mdash;I am talking about the open narrowcasting television services&mdash;unless the films have been modified as mentioned in paragraph 123(3C)(b). That says that there have to be established codes that provide for methods of modifying films having particular classifications under that system so that the films are suitable to be broadcast or the films are suitable to be broadcast at particular times, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about open narrowcasting television services. How do we know? Are we going to leave it up to the broadcasters themselves to decide? That is what you are proposing. In fact, that has been one of the problems in the current situation with regard to modifications to films.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will endeavour 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7800"> to obtain a considered view of the government's approach to `demeaning' for Senator Harradine. But I repeat that, at the end of the day, it is not so much a matter of the definition of the term because, as we have just seen, the terms `demean' and `debase' are almost interchangeable. It is really the application of that. You could not have a better example of how views can differ on this matter than to look at the Democrats, whose position, as enunciated by Senator Bourne, seems to be that we should allow X&hyphen;rated material on narrowcast pay television whilst at the same time, presumably, arguing that it is not inherently demeaning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly a matter of how you interpret the principle, and we do not resile from the principle. We think it is a fundamentally important one. There is a lot of material shown on free to air television that I would regard as being of pretty average quality. There is probably a lot of material that many of us would argue has very little redeeming social content, but it is a matter of applying your principle to what is currently available and drawing the line at an appropriate point. I will certainly come back to Senator Harradine on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of paragraph 6 of schedule 1 is simply to apply the existing codes of practice and an R modification regime that applies to commercial free to air television stations to what is, I think, very unhelpfully defined as `open narrowcast television' but which in fact means `non&hyphen;commercial free to air television'. Licensees and operators will be required to have the same standards&mdash;in other words, to not draw that distinction, if you like, and to treat the whole free to air sector in the same manner. They will be required to have codes of conduct which will be essentially self&hyphen;regulating in the first instance. But, to the extent that the ABA regards the codes of conduct as not coming within the proper definition, or if there are particular operators or licensees who do not adhere to a code of practice, it will have the power to punish them for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has worked fairly well in the free to air sector. We expect the same approach to apply to what is currently the community sector. To 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the extent that you want to argue across the board that there ought to be a tightening of that regime, that is a separate debate. At the moment, there is a very big loophole that allows so&hyphen;called open narrowcasting or, to put it another way, non&hyphen;commercial free to air to have carte blanche. We do not think that is acceptable. We want to treat all free to air in the same manner, and that is the effect of this provision.</PARA></SPEECH>

Has the ABA examined any of those films to see if the modifications have resulted in material that does not go beyond the previous AO classification criteria? That is quite specific in the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  has been passed off by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) as merely technical amendments&mdash;legislation which is designed to correct drafting and minor errors contained in the act. Whilst the opposition concedes there a number of genuinely technical amendments that it will not oppose, also incorporated in these changes are amendments which, in our view, seek to make substantial changes to the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I outline our concerns over these amendments I would like to briefly review the industrial relations climate that the government has created and what is, in our view, a totally partisan approach employed by the minister in claiming to want a more flexible labour market. What the minister means by a more flexible labour market is a lowering of wages and a reduction of workers' rights and conditions. We already see that happening right across the board in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the government's push for flexibility comes a call for what is quite obviously a debate on US&hyphen;style minimum wages. This is the shape of things to come, as far as we are concerned, from the government: confrontation, unrest and victimisation of employees. We have an industrial relations system which is anti&hyphen;collective bargaining. We have an industrial relations minister who champions individual contracts and champions the right to choose. However, when an employee chooses to belong to a union, the right to choose a collective bargaining process is conveniently ignored by this minister. Why 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7802"> wouldn't he ignore the workers' rights to choose? After all, that is what the Workplace Relations Act is fundamentally about&mdash;bringing an end to collective bargaining forever. That is what this government's agenda is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians elected the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) trusting his promise that no worker would be worse off. That commitment has been breached. The promise has been breached, and well and truly shattered, by direct actions by this government. In fact, the government is now not even bothering to attempt to persuade the electorate that it intends to adhere to the commitment that it gave. I will illustrate to senators just why the Australian people no longer believes this government. The reasons that I could cite would be a very lengthy list. However, I have limited time, so I will concentrate on the matter of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators will remember that during the debate on the Workplace Relations Act we, on this side of the chamber, highlighted that the stripping back of hard&hyphen;won conditions would be high on the coalition's agenda. It was very clear to us, and it was very clear to anybody who participates within the industrial relations system that that was precisely what this government was about. The government's chance had finally arrived and the minister was champing at the bit to go rabid with regard to this. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 14 October said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports a proposal by employers to scrap more than half of the provisions of the main hospitality industry award.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly what sort of employees will be affected by the government's intention to scrap these provisions? These workers are the ones covered by the hospitality award, that is, people who actually work in restaurants, hotels and so on who are at the bottom of the totem pole in terms of industrial muscle and industrial strength and are already lowly paid. They are the sort of people we are talking about. The people who are already disadvantaged will be even further disadvantaged. So much for the Howard battlers, I say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not enough for the minister for industrial relations who, as I said before, is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exhibiting an amazingly partisan attitude with regard to IR. In the same article he was quoted as calling for employers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resist moves by unions to entrench provisions removed from awards into agreements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What happened to the right to choose? What happened to the right of an employer and an employee, or an employer and a group of employees, to decide what goes into an agreement or an award or an AWA? The fact is this is contrary to the previous commitment that he gave in his second reading speech in the original debate on the Workplace Relations Bill, in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All matters beyond those specified should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But now he is saying, `No, I did not really mean that. What I am about here is being partisan&mdash;this is what I want,' and desperately attempting to convince employers that this is the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again the minister has shown what we regard as his total disregard for the welfare of workers and an intense dislike for harmony between employers and employees. This disregard is exhibited by his criticism of the enterprise agreement negotiated by the Finance Sector Union and the National Australia Bank. I would have thought that he would have said that that was a good deal for the finance sector. The employer group and the union group came together and negotiated something which was acceptable to both groups. But he did not like that. He said, `Sorry that is not the way we want to go. We do not want harmony.' Wherever there are negotiations going on between employers and employees you will see the shadowy figure of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business urging employers to carry out the government's agenda on industrial relations and strip away conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to some contemporary examples of this. We have the somewhat extraordinary activities employed by the minister to extend the disputes in the Hunter Valley and on the Cairns waterfront. In the Hunter Valley dispute, the minister backed confrontation rather than acting in the best interests of Australia and supporting arbitra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7803"> tion and cooperation. That is the bottom line. Who is hurting? The reality is that it is not simply the people who are employed there who are hurting but also the Australian economy that is hurting. He did not back Bob Carr's move for an arbitrated agreement. Basically, the government did not support the determination of the AIRC to move towards arbitration with regard to this matter. So what do we have? We have industrial anarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister did with the Cairns dispute was ludicrous. It was something akin to the antics of an Inspector Clouseau style minister for industrial relations. You can picture at the time the minister pacing up and down his office, calling the company and saying, `Hang in there. We will smash the waterfront union' and so on. When 26 Australian employees were sacked we had the unedifying spectacle of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business standing on the sidelines cheering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about a bunch of rabid employees. There had not been a dispute on the waterfront in Cairns for 23 years, but Minister Reith decided that that was going to be the place where his so-called micro-economic reform with regard to the waterfront was going to occur. At a time when job insecurity is one of the paramount issues we had the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business cheering on the sidelines. This creates an unstable environment for not only the Australian work force but also the Australian economy. It therefore has deleterious effects on employment creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This act allows, and the minister in fact encourages, an attack on wages, an attack on jobs and an attack on job security. Some employees who belong to unions will stand up and say, `Hold on, that is not fair.' What happens to employees who are not members of unions and who occupy positions of little power in the company in the individual negotiation process? These workers have no protection. These workers would need to resist these sorts of attempts to diminish their wages and conditions, alone and with no support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that Australians see this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as having no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vision and no direction when all that this government is serving up to workers and their families is a more stressful and insecure workplace and diminished job opportunities. Latest statistics, which were released yesterday, with regard to wages show yet another drop in the wages of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this we have a situation where a small fortune is required to access federal courts. So you cannot access justice either if you are a low paid worker in this country. That is obviously a denial of justice&mdash;not only natural but any type of justice. I remind honourable senators that we had a 500 per cent increase in filing fees in the Federal Court under this government. If they do not get you one way they will get you another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in stark contrast to the industrial relations environment that the Labor Party encourages which is based on fairness. We will restore the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the independent umpire that people had faith in in terms of arbitrated decisions. We will promote a policy where the award system will not be undermined but where it will be, in fact, strengthened. We will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate. We will put an end to secrecy in terms of AWAs and the operations of that office. That is our commitment. Obviously, we in the Labor Party believe that we have a duty to provide remedial action with regard to what this government has done and restore fairness to a system which worked very well for many decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to put on the record my dismay that this government has failed to come to grips with the real shortcomings in the act&mdash;the shortcomings which, as I have said before, are all too apparent to Australian employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I move to our concerns with the bill, I reiterate that the Labor Party will be supporting those amendments which are genuinely technical. I will take the opportunity now to broadly outline some of our concerns with regard to these amendments. The amendments dealing with certified agreements relate to the period allowed to employees to consider a certified agreement. This period is to be continuous regardless of whether a new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7804"> employee signs on two or 12 days after the commencement of the period. That is, a new employee may&mdash;in an extreme case only&mdash;have a day or less to peruse an agreement. We on this side of the chamber do appreciate the difficulty in catering for the various situations which may arise and we are sympathetic to the need to ensure the period is not pushed out too far. However, we are keen to ensure that there is a realistic minimum time for perusal of an agreement. That is the basis of our opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment requires a minimum of seven days unless the commission, the AIRC, determines otherwise. In a situation where there is cause for the commission to believe that actions are vexatious or frivolous, the AIRC could intervene and determine that the action is not appropriate in that circumstance. We believe that this minimum is necessary and that our amendment will not create an undue burden. We believe that workers should be given time to fully understand the legally binding document which their working future will depend on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that there will be cases where workers will not be given a reasonable amount of time to study the agreement and to ask questions with regard to that agreement. Surely it is not too much to expect that workers will have an opportunity to fully comprehend their agreement and to be fully apprised of the impact of the agreement. After all, what we are talking about is their working future, their work environment and the wages and conditions regime under which they will be working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments regarding the Employment Advocate endeavour, in our view, to give that person even greater powers than Mr Rowe already has. It is no secret on this side of the chamber that we do not believe that the Office of the Employment Advocate should exist. That is our position. It was highlighted during the original debate that accountability requirements were woefully inadequate. We made that point again and again. Unfortunately, we have been proven to be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me account to you some of the often quite alarming incidents with regard to the Office of the Employment Advocate endeav 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ouring to avoid accountability, incidents which are occurring far too often. To illustrate this, it is important to advise the chamber of a most extraordinary series of events that happened in the estimates with regard to this. When the Employment Advocate was asked to give reasons for his decisions when dealing with whether or not an AWA meets the no disadvantage test, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not obliged to give reasons for my decisions. I have explained the general way that I am approaching the no disadvantage test. I do not see any need to go to specific AWAs and give reasons for those decisions. I am not obliged to do so under the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Excuse me! This is a Senate estimates committee. He is actually required under law to provide that information if we, as elected representatives of the Australian people, so wish. When I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it is a personal decision of yours because there is no prohibition under the act. The act does not say, `Do not provide reasons for your decisions with regard to the no disadvantage test,' does it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, it does not.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you have made that decision. Why?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then came a ruling from the chair, which I still cannot believe. Senator Ferguson was in the chair, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would rule that question out of order because it is not a fair question. He has already answered and said he is not obliged to, and if he chooses not to answer the question then that is his choice . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a lot of stuff about choice in here, I have to say. The Employment Advocate has choice, but Australian workers do not. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and he does not have to give reasons as to why he is not going to answer it. He says he is not obliged to answer the question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Apart from the fact that that is fairly contorted English, I think we pretty much get the message. The chair went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words that Mr Rowe used were that, under the act, he is not obliged to give reasons as to why he does not give you the reasons in response to the question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bear with me. He continued:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7805">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If he is not obliged to, he does not then have to answer a further question as to why he will not.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If it were not so serious, it would be funny. The protection does not end there. When I inquired:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where legislation is silent and an officer determines that administrative action is not in fact encompassed by legislation, a Senate estimates committee cannot question an officer as to why that administrative action was taken.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the chair replied: `Correct.' The Clerk of the Senate had something to say about that at subsequent estimates rounds. There you have it. That is the extent to which the government will go to protect the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After several rounds of estimates and an absolute bagging in the media, Mr Rowe decided that he might start acting like an independent statutory officer, and at the last round of estimates a little bit more leeway was provided to us, we were cut a bit more slack. We were promised some information, which we still do not have. I understand it is in the minister's office.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the government and the Employment Advocate are using the act so they do not have to be held accountable to parliament. I think that incident was fairly illustrative of what is going on. They are using the act to shield themselves from scrutiny. It is not good enough to say, `I don't have to answer that because the act does not expressly say that I have to.' That is an absolute joke, and that is not the way that estimates should operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shroud of secrecy surrounding the Employment Advocate should be lifted and the Employment Advocate must be held accountable. The opposition will not be supporting amendments that increase the power of the Office of the Employment Advocate, given the way the government is using it. There is a lack of accountability, a lack of transparency and a shroud of secrecy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surrounding the activities of this office. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The set of government amendments pertaining to the no disadvantage test is to allow the commission and the Employment Advocate to use a state award when determining whether an agreement meets the no disadvantage test if there is no appropriate federal award. We will be opposing these amendments. We believe that these changes have the potential to lower the standard of the no disadvantage test applying to the scrutiny of AWAs, which, let me remind the chamber, have primacy over any other type of industrial agreement. AWAs are indeed a very powerful little instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major reasons we will be opposing it is the dismal industrial relations record of various conservative state governments around Australia. It is our view that state awards will be further eroded by conservative governments and, subsequently, so will employees' wages and conditions. For this reason, we will be opposing the amendments. The effect of these amendments certainly could not be classed as technical. They have the capacity to directly, severely and detrimentally affect Australian employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government talks about changes to the termination of employment, I start to wonder what group it is trying to exclude now. I would like to take the opportunity to say that what Peter Reith has said in the media, subsequent to the Senate's decision on unfair dismissal yesterday, has been absolutely outrageous. He is again attempting to say that they are our laws that the government was attempting to amend. They are the government's laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attempt yesterday to change its own laws to exclude small business employees from using federal unfair dismissal laws was seen for what it was. It was a con and, as we said yesterday, a stunt by a desperate government that is increasingly attempting to be part of the game and attempting to gain some relevancy with regard to the economy. The government's argument was so weak that not even one government member, other than Minister Alston, who spoke in a robotic way for about two minutes, even attempted to defend it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to digress.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  contains a myriad of mind&hyphen;bogglingly dull technical, but essential, modifications to the Workplace Relations Act to correct various unintended and unforeseen results flowing from last year's landmark amendment bill on workplace relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that we consider this bill 12 months after we considered the main act&mdash;or bill, as it was then&mdash;and use it as an opportunity to see how the act is operating in practice and whether further modifications might be needed. The Democrats will, like Labor, be supporting the bulk of the bill, but we do have some amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am often on the record stating my view that workplace relations reform must be an evolutionary matter and must be viewed in that light. Having said that, I believe that reform should not proceed at a pace that is beyond the capacity of employers, employees or their respective organisations to adjust to the nature of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not underestimate the extent of insecurity and concerns being felt out there in Australian workplaces. That insecurity&mdash;caused by high unemployment, the rapid growth in casualisation of the work force, corporate downsizing and a growing gap between rich and poor&mdash;is generating job insecurity, and holding back consumer confidence and growth in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be very careful to ensure that, while our legislative setting on workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relations does promote productivity and should promote fairness, it also takes into account the need to provide levels of security and stability for workers, employers and their organisations, because we know that the effects of insecurity are not just social but massively economic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the major reforms we negotiated last year need some time yet to bed down. As I said at a major employers conference on labour market reform a few weeks ago, employers need to make full use of the bill to achieve the maximum productivity possible from it before they start to try to make out a case for further reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that they are almost the picture of someone with a greedy nature who has before him some food, but already wants more. Certainly, the Democrats can see no case at this point in time for further significant federal labour market reform. In particular, we continue to see no case for stripping back or resiling from the award safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations Act of 1996 allows for 100 per cent flexibility on an above&hyphen;award basis, but it allows no undermining of significant award conditions and wages. I hear employers and the special media sector talking about `the need' for further labour market reform. What they are talking about, as we all know, is shorthand for 100 per cent flexibility for wages and conditions below the award level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have accepted the principle that it is reasonable to look at that above the award level, but below the award level it is quite unacceptable and unnecessary. The Democrats do not support such an approach. Indeed, the best research we have seen from overseas countries with significantly deregulated labour markets&mdash;such as the United States, Canada and Britain&mdash;suggest that such a course is unlikely to lead to higher employment; rather, it will push many vulnerable workers into working poverty&mdash;in other words, the working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that people have a view that it is better to be very poor and work than to be a little better off and not work, but the fact is that our system has served Australia excep 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7807"> tionally well over decades and we think there are other policy mechanisms which can cope with the employment problem rather than this particular mechanism. Australia, which rightly prides itself on its fair&hyphen;go mentality and egalitarian tradition, must avoid an outcome which takes the worst of foreign models to heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amending bill deals with a number of difficulties that have inevitably emerged with the operation of the new act, particularly the operation of the new Office of the Employment Advocate. As my Labor colleagues know, I remain a strong supporter of the government's right to try to make that new institution work, but it does not mean that I am not keeping a close eye on it&mdash;as I know they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent over three hours with the Employment Advocate, Alan Rowe, in his Sydney office and I received a detailed briefing on the operations of his office. I appreciated the courtesy and the openness with which the members of the OEA spoke to me.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKAY" NAMEID="9L6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Rowe, as Senator Mackay knows, has also made his views known to the Senate estimates committee several times. I suspect he will be asked to make those views known several more times. However, in the spirit of a fair go, it is a new institution and we must attend to the particulars of that office and how the act deals with it rather than with Mr Rowe himself, because personally he is quite accessible and helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was extremely impressed with the arrangements being put in place by Mr Rowe with regard to the no&hyphen;disadvantage test. It seems to me, from the way that has been described to me, that it is being done in a more rigorous and systematic way than was ever applied by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Of course, we would like to make sure that that is monitored and audited by somebody from outside. Senators are addressing themselves as to how that can best be accomplished in a way which meets the needs of the government, the Office of the Employment Advocate, employers, and employees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would expect nothing less, given that the OEA is not performing its scrutiny in the public gaze as the AIRC does, and does not take public submissions from unions on agreements as does the Industrial Relations Commission. For that reason, Labor has correctly focused on a need to make sure that the processes are done well and objectively, and look after the interests of all parties concerned. By and large, I think Mr Rowe's concerns and the other problems identified by the government are largely well founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be opposing two proposals to allow the Employment Advocate to ignore technical defects in AWAs&mdash;at least as presently expressed by the government&mdash;and to take submissions from persons other than the parties. We would have no objection to ignoring the fact that somebody ticked instead of crossed something or failed to do something really minor, but the way in which the amendments have been expressed concerns us as to the enlarged discretion, which is potentially there. We think both of these provisions would allow the Employment Advocate to reduce that intense and high level of objective scrutiny, which they are attempting to apply at present and which we believe are absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing potential amendments to this bill, we have been at pains to avoid reopening the entire debate&mdash;not least because I do not feel like a series of body blows today. We have focused on technical amendments. We will be moving minor amendments to other aspects of the bill dealing with arbitration during a bargaining period and applications for termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee stage, I also intend to move amendments sought by the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers&mdash;I understand they have been lobbying all parties&mdash;to the disamalgamation provisions to make them more workable from their perspective. In addition, the Democrats will be moving three amendments to fix what we believe have either emerged as holes in the original legislation or arisen as problems since the new act commenced. Our amendments will seek to ensure that the level of protection for workers envisaged in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7808"> original bill does apply as was intended and as we understood it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first amendment is to restore the fast-track award making power for federal awards where a state government takes punitive action against a union for pursuing a federal award. I recall that that occurred in Victoria. Eventually, that had the unintended consequence of Victorian legislation being given up. The Victorians now fall under federal legislation. So maybe there are some strange things that can result from these processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment has become necessary because of the passage of Minister Graham Keirath's second wave industrial relations legislation in Western Australia earlier this year. The most harsh provisions of that state act allow the minister to cancel the respondence of a state union to a state award and to strip that union of its membership coverage if it dares to apply for a federal award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of discussion about freedom of choice. There is not much freedom of choice when you prevent someone legitimately applying for jurisdiction legally and being punished for it. This fundamentally breaches the careful balance in the federal act, where it was supposed to be up to employers and employees together to pick the jurisdiction and the type of regulation which best suited them. I would hope that, given the government's continual reference to the virtues of freedom of choice, they will, in fact, support our amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that it may take up to three to four years to achieve a federal award, the Democrats are concerned that the Keirath bill could leave many Western Australian workers and employers without an up-to-date award because their union and their employer will be denied the right to update and enforce their state award while they are pursuing a federal award. To prevent the inevitable eroding of employment conditions within the state award, the Democrats propose that, if the state minister does take action against a state union for making a federal application, it would trigger a fast-track mechanism whereby the AIRC would be required to deal with the matter as quickly as possible, including the making of an interim award, and could there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fore ignore the extra and constraining evidentiary provisions of section 111AAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our second material amendment&mdash;we think it is a material technical amendment&mdash;deals with the issue of collective bargaining. When the Democrats were dealing with the amendments last year, a key threshold issue that the ACTU wished us to address was to ensure that Australia upheld its international obligations under ILO conventions to prefer collective bargaining over individual bargaining. Members will recall that one of the amendments we were able to get in was, in fact, to restore as well as we could international obligations in that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had several meetings with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, on that matter. We were finally persuaded by the minister and his staff that the bill did indeed prefer collective bargaining over individual bargaining. In particular, the minister's office pointed to the fact that under section 170LA the Industrial Relations Commission has a positive duty to facilitate the making of collective certified agreements. I received advice as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to appreciate that the AIRC will have extensive conciliation powers to facilitate the negation of certified agreements, which may include, for example, ordering the parties to attend compulsory conferences. Indeed, under section 170LA, the AIRC is required as far as practicable to perform its function in such a way as to facilitate the making of certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In dealing with the situation where employers want to bargain individually and the workers want to bargain collectively&mdash;in other words, there is a difference of opinion as to how they want to be dealt with&mdash;I was further advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such employees would have a number of options open to them: in particular, they could initiate a bargaining period for a CA, and they could also appoint their union as their bargaining agent. If the employer still wished to negotiate an agreement, he would have to deal with the union. The union and the employer would then have to negotiate whether any agreement was to be in the form of a collective AWA or a certified agreement. The employees would be able to act collectively, and would be able to take protective action. They could also seek the assistance of the AIRC to facilitate a CA if they wished. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7809">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am absolutely in support of employees and employers pursuing individual agreements where both are willing and both feel that that is the best course. I doubt there is anybody in the Senate who opposes that. But I am not supportive of a situation where workers in an inferior bargaining position who wish to bargain collectively would be obliged to take up individual agreements. It is plainly their right to be able to negotiate collectively, and it is a right that has been recognised throughout the civilised world for well over a century and probably more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how we understood the bill would operate&mdash;that workers could not be forced by their employers to bargain individually. But in practice there are now some doubts that it necessarily always works out that way. The disputes in the Hunter raised by Senator Mackay show that the powers of the IRC to facilitate the making of collective agreements are not as strong as we thought. They show that employers can still continue to try to undermine collective bargaining by trying to force in individual agreements even during a bargaining period. The disputes at the Commonwealth Bank as well show a similar determination by an employer to undermine collective bargaining by trying to force in individual agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we propose is a technical amendment to give the commission the power to make any orders that it deems necessary to fulfil its statutory obligations to facilitate the making of certified agreements and collective bargaining where the workers or the employers need that device activated. Such orders would not extend to stopping protected action as the act clearly intended such action to be protected. But, certainly, such orders could extend to preventing the predatory offering or approval of AWAs, for example, or other punitive action by employers against unions and workers wanting to bargain collectively. Our amendment would also allow the seeking of injunctions to enforce such orders if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our third amendment is in relation to strike pay. The Democrats strongly support the intention of the bill to prevent employees being paid when they are on strike. But what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most Australians understand as a strike and what is described as an industrial action in the act are very different. The act picks up as a strike any performance of work which is different from how it is customarily performed. So even if a worker is at work for their full contracted hours, is performing 99 per cent of the work allocated to him or her and is flat out all day, the employer under this law is obliged not to pay them. We thought there was common law protection in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we dealt with this legislation, the government placed great emphasis on the rider to the definition of industrial action in section 4 which says that an employer is not engaged in industrial action if the employees' action is agreed to by the employer. `Agreed to' you would think would mean acceptance by the employer of the work that was being performed. That was certainly our reading of it. However, the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business has since adopted a much stricter interpretation. Its guidelines sent out to all public sector managers compel managers to refuse to pay in all circumstances where the other conditions of section 4 have been met. I wrote to the minister and I met the minister to discuss this excessively provocative stance taken by his department in relation to only partial bans on work, but he stood by the department's hardline stance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason and given the act is not being interpreted as we expected it would, I will be moving a technical amendment to delete from industrial action for the purposes of strike pay, action that does not prevent employees being fully engaged in their duties during the ordinary hours of work. I should note that such a ban would continue to be regarded as industrial action for all other purposes in the bill, including the issuing of orders by the IRC and injunctions under section 127 for failing to comply with such orders. All that our amendment will mean is that workers will still be paid for the work that they are performing, especially when the employer has agreed to that practice occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the Democrats will be supporting the vast bulk of this bill as a timely and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has told us that this bill on the whole represents technical amendments necessary after a period of review of the operations of the Workplace Relations Act that were supported by the peak employer group, the ACCI, and for the most part the ACTU. For that statement alone and for what the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  represents, I think we need to revisit precisely how the minister has been dealing with his portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay referred to the reference to the minister as Partisan Pete and in the past he has been referred to as Penthouse Pete, but I think a new term is appropriate. I would call him the Stealth Raider. `Raider' because, as Senator Mackay has already pointed out, the minister has been zoning in on industries promoting disputation and confrontation&mdash;not only the high profile industries we have heard through the media recently, such as mining and the waterfront, but also now the hospitality industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is now encouraging employers in the hospitality industry not to put into agreements provisions that will be ripped out of awards. He was actively encouraging employers to continue disputation rather than reach agreement about what provisions previously in their awards might still be current and might still be necessary in their employment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to `stealth' because, consistent with the minister's usual style, this bill seeks to make some substantive amendments under the guise of technical changes. Senator Mackay went through several of those, but I would like to highlight a few, particularly following Senator Murray's remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to extending the powers of the Employment Advocate, I concur with Senator Mackay that, given the difficulties we have had to date with the issue of accountability with the Employment Advocate, I do not think it is the time for us to be looking at extending the powers of the Office of the Employment Advocate. Once we see coming 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out of that office the results of the more recent cooperation in terms of accountability to us here, it may be appropriate to look at some of those problems and some of the difficulties that the office has encountered. But until such time, I do not think that that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the Democrats' support for the Office of the Employment Advocate, but I think that the Democrats should look at what this office is actually doing. For all the Australian Democrats' good intentions about the role of the Office of the Employment Advocate and how it will assist workers who do not want to be represented by unions, we only need the reminder in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> regarding  the first action of this Office of the Employment Advocate to know what it is really about&mdash;that is, it is a tool for this government. Even though the Employment Advocate has the ability to provide legal representation for workers who have difficulties in relation to their employment agreements, its first action is to pursue, by alleging breach of freedom of association, the National Union of Workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have sought information from the Office of the Employment Advocate about how they will actually represent workers in relation to their employment difficulties. To date, we have had no response at all. As we know from other examples, the Office of the Employment Advocate, on behalf of this government, is actively pursuing unions. That is no surprise to us, but I think the Australian Democrats should reconsider what they originally envisaged was to be the role of the Office of the Employment Advocate so as to pull it back into line and perform those functions. I do not think that extending its powers at this stage will achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of substantive change is in relation to a prohibition regarding unfair termination. Frankly, I am absolutely stunned that the Australian Democrats are allowing this one to go through. Given their approach to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill  yesterday, this quite blatant attempt by the government to remove workers' entitlements to challenge unfair termination&mdash;currently, if 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7811"> they do not have access at a federal level, they can access the state level&mdash;astounds me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another substantive change relates to the disamalgamation provisions. In part, we can accept what was done when the original bill went through, but the retrospective nature of these changes is another very substantive concern. The most significant change signifying what I believe represents the minister's stealth in relation to this bill relates to the state override. Senator Murray and all of the other senators involved in the inquiry regarding the Workplace Relations Bill will remember, at least on being reminded, that the state override issue was perhaps one of the most fundamental of the issues originally raised. We heard evidence on it day after day after day, and that evidence was successful in convincing the Australian Democrats and the government&mdash;we were already convinced&mdash;that they had to amend the legislation to ensure that workers would not lose entitlements by having state provisions override their entitlements under the federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister is seeking to have another bite at the cherry. He has come back again and has said, under the guise of a technical amendment, `We will now look at state awards in relation to the no disadvantage test being applied in relation to agreements&mdash;not federal, but state.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, when looking at an agreement, would have had to have looked at a relevant federal award. An employee may currently be covered by a federal award, but they could be confronted with an agreement, so the no disadvantage test will be compared with a state award that they are not under now. As I said, it stuns me that, after going through the lengthy evidence that we had when we considered the original Workplace Relations Bill, the Democrats have not seen that Minister Reith is coming back for a second bite at the cherry on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator Murray said that he was disappointed that the government had not honoured their agreement. I think this is another example of the government not honouring their agreement. But, for some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason or another, the Democrats are falling for it. Peter Reith is coming back for a second bite at the cherry but the Democrats do not see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to hear, in relation to the Office of the Employment Advocate, that the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment in relation to technical defects because, hopefully, they have reached the same conclusion that we have, that the office is not up to making those sorts of decisions at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in relation to submissions from other than the parties, I was pleased to hear that the Democrats&mdash;probably on behalf of employers, rather than the workers themselves&mdash;will not be supporting this attempt to perhaps legalise the process. It will make the process far more difficult for workers who, if they are with the Office of the Employment Advocate, probably do not have the assistance of unions and are most unlikely to be able to afford the legal representation that their employer would be able to afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note with interest that the Democrats have used this opportunity to revisit the Workplace Relations Act. I think it is interesting to note some of the issues that they are now highlighting, and particularly the one with respect to collective bargaining. I was reminded, I suppose you could say, of the line that was fed to the Democrats in relation to this legislation&mdash;that it actually promotes collective bargaining. I should say, perhaps, that it was claimed that it promoted collective bargaining; at no stage were we anywhere near convinced of that line. But I think it is important to note that the Democrats are reconsidering the lines that were fed them back when they did this deal. They are now struggling with amendments to try and rectify the harm that was done to Australia's industrial relations system through the deal that was done between the minister and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to highlight what this bill is not about. This bill is not about doing anything about the decline in employment security for Australian workers. Nothing in any of these proposals will result in the Workplace Relations Act doing anything for those battlers, those workers out there strug 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7812"> gling to find employment security. If anything, what is in the bill takes away a few more of their entitlements&mdash;particularly with Peter Reith's second bite at the cherry on the state override issue and particularly with removing access, if the bill is successful, to state jurisdictions in relation to unfair termination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we again highlight that, while a fair number of these amendments are technical, there are other things cloaked in this bill. That is fairly typical of the minister's approach to workplace relations in Australia&mdash;hiding what he is really about and promoting confrontation and disputation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak today on the government's dismal and increasingly embarrassing public record on industrial relations. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> &mdash;which we have been told requires amendment due to drafting errors and the fact that there will be some unintended consequences arising out of that&mdash;is a bill with which I have a number of concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes some substantive amendments which favour employers at the expense of workers. Although there has been some watering down of the government's grand plan to deregulate the labour market and to treat workers like any other commodity or inanimate object used in the production process, we remain fundamentally opposed to its ideologically driven principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, at the same time as the introduction of AWAs and the creation of the Office of the Employment Advocate, supposedly to vet the new AWAs, is certainly having some interesting results. AWAs, as provided for in the legislation, are clearly just a mechanism for eroding current working conditions and pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An AWA operating at the Coominya meatworks in Queensland demonstrates all too clearly that the Office of the Employment Advocate is merely a rubber stamp. The Coominya meatworks, in a small town about 100 kilometres north&hyphen;west of Brisbane, put about 100 workers on AWAs around June. Although the AWAs left workers between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $100 and $150 a week worse off than they were under the award&mdash;so much for the no disadvantage test!&mdash;and although the union made a submission on their behalf to the employment advocate, that AWA was subsequently approved. This is in spite of the fact that 20 workers rang the employment advocate on the 1&hyphen;800 number to explain, prior to the AWAs being approved, that they had been coerced into signing the AWA on the threat of losing their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AWA was so bad that, when a unionised meatworks at Grantham opened about 60 kilometres away, key boning and slicing personnel left and sought employment at the Grantham meatworks. The manager of the Coominya meatworks then went to New Zealand to hire a work force. In true high farce style, these workers subsequently went to Coominya but quit after three weeks work. If the playwright Joe Orton were still alive, he would be having a field day with this plot. Ironically, the Coominya meatworks is owned by the US multinational Keystone, as in&mdash;wait for it&mdash;Keystone Cops. They seem to have brought their employment practices over here with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed changes to this bill will allow a person authorised in writing by a party to an AWA to explain that party's understanding of the effect of the AWA or ancillary document to the Employment Advocate, but that will be limited to situations where the Employment Advocate feels this is appropriate. Even when the Employment Advocate does allow that representative to appear, that representative will still be limited only to explaining the party's understanding of the effect of the agreement and are expressly prohibited from making submissions or from being heard for any other purpose. Members of groups in society who have been traditionally disadvantaged in the workplace&mdash;young people, women and workers from non-English speaking backgrounds&mdash;will be doubly disadvantaged under this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not address the fundamental problems of this government's ideological obsession with so-called reform of industrial relations. More specifically, there is growing evidence that the so-called reforms are un 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7813"> necessary and unfair. They are also a major breach of pre-election commitments given by this government. I guess the breaking of this commitment must be just another one of those `non-core' promises that the Prime Minister, John Howard, is so fond of telling us about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Queensland, we have already seen the consequences of this government's obsession with so-called industrial reform in the mining industry. A couple of key issues have arisen out of some of the industrial disputes occurring in Queensland. The first is that the legislation leads to messy, protracted disputes which are not good for workers, their families or the companies involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent provocative actions by management at the Gordonstone coalmine in Queensland are exacerbating this dispute. The company has now moved to increase rent on the homes of sacked workers fivefold. The company, as has been widely reported in the media, has also hired 25 security guards who are carrying guns and who have been reported as intimidating workers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Curragh mine, Arco decided to dramatically reduce their number of staff by 50 per cent&mdash;which amounted to 200 workers&mdash;in order to increase productivity right in the middle of their enterprise bargaining negotiations. This does make me somewhat suspicious about whether they are really bargaining in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attempts by this company to override the award in relation to mutually agreed provisions for retrenchments led to a strike which lasted 15 weeks. The Minister for Industrial Relations in Queensland, Mr Santo Santoro, has stated in parliament that the cost to the Queensland economy has been $10 million a week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my contribution today in the matters of public interest debate I wish to celebrate the tenacity and courage of Miss Karen Dare. Miss Dare is a student at the University of Tasmania. She is aged 19 years, is a first&hyphen;year science student from the isolated west coast of Tasmania and is in receipt of Abstudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Miss Dare has a principled objection to joining the student union. As a result, she has refused to pay the fee. Whilst some student union sanction might be expected, it is appalling to find that the university administration is applying the sanction on behalf of the student union by debarring Miss Dare from enrolment for 1998. In my home state of Tasmania there has been some suggestion that she has, in fact, not been debarred. But let me simply put on the record that I have documentation issued by the University of Tasmania which is headed `Application for Enrolment 1998'. It is addressed to Miss Karen Dare and it has on it `DEBARRED: Outstanding 1997 fee $253.00'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Tasmania was embroiled in a similar unedifying situation some three years ago when they tried to ban a prize&hyphen;winning student, Daniel Muggeridge, for exactly the same reasons that Miss Dare finds herself debarred today. At the time, the university agreed to alter its rules. Now, sure, you do not have to join the student union, but you have to pay the fee, and in full. We have a piece of somewhat tortured logic when the university administration says, `We will respect your right not to join the union, but we will force you to pay the money to the student union. By the fact that you are not a member, you will, of course, be denied the right to have a say over how that money is spent.' `Pay up and do not join; pay and be denied the right to say how your money is spent,' is basically the line that Professor Lidl, the Deputy Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University, has stated publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the University of Tasmania administration that this is an ongoing fight. Students in my day, some 20 years ago, were concerned about the compulsory aspect of student unionism. I note in the public gallery 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7814"> today a former president of the Tasmania University Union who is of a similar view that student unionism ought be voluntary. Daniel Muggeridge took up the fight some three years ago; Miss Karen Dare is taking up the fight again today. So, I say to the university administration: this issue will not go away until you address it and give students their fundamental rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental question is: what is more important? The enforcement of compulsory student unionism or a student's right to an education? Student unions, quite simply, ought to survive on their own merit. If they provide the services and facilities that they claim are of great benefit to the students, one would anticipate that the students, in their wisdom, would realise that and voluntarily join up. The fact that the university acknowledges, and the student union acknowledges, that the fee has to be levied on a compulsory basis is, of course, an admission by the university and the student union that they could not survive in an open marketplace where students are given a choice as to whether or not they want those alleged services and whether or not they want to belong to the student union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter is a matter of great concern, as a result of which I wrote to Vice&hyphen;Chancellor McNicol on 20 October. I will read my letter to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Professor McNicol</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was horrified to read about Miss Dare's draconian debarment from the University by your administration for refusing to pay the student union fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principled stand taken by Miss Dare is fully supported by myself. Her courage is to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the University continues to operate as a second rate shop steward for the student union it will be, quite justifiably, held up to public ridicule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge you to assure the public that freedom of association is alive on your campus by providing Miss Dare her full entitlements as a student who has incurred a $4,500 HECS debt with your University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any actions short of abolishing compulsory student unionism will ensure that the University's reputation is not rehabilitated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I await your urgent response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The only thing Vice&hyphen;Chancellor McNicol did, in fact, was provide a quick response. I want to canvass aspects of that response with the Senate this afternoon. Part of the letter reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that we are not about to see a publicity campaign of the sort which was run previously on this matter, but if that turns out to be the case may I assure you that the University of Tasmania will put clearly and plainly the reasons for students paying the Services and Amenities Fee. If those amenities were not provided and I see no government in the offing which would underwrite their funding, students in Tasmania would be deprived of services and facilities enjoyed by their mainland counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Can I just interpose there and ask the vice&hyphen;chancellor: why does he think those services are enjoyed by student counterparts on the mainland? If they are so enjoyed, as the vice&hyphen;chancellor would assert, why does it have to be a compulsory levy? I would have thought the students would be lining up for the enjoyment and paying the money over voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: what is so fundamentally important about the student union fee that, if you do not pay it, you should not be allowed to continue your education? What are these facilities? They include a bit of beer drinking and a bit of subsidised coffee in the refectory. You are allowed to pay $5 a year up-front so you can then drink subsidised coffee all year. It does not make much sense to most people. You can have the benefit of the student newspaper, which most people realise is just a rag and do not want to be part of, or you can join the chocolate appreciation society&mdash;another one of those worthy causes which the vice&hyphen;chancellor undoubtedly is referring to. The vice&hyphen;chancellor's correspondence continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University is keenly aware that mainland universities compete with us for Tasmanian and international students. A loss of students to more attractive mainland campuses would not only result in decreased Commonwealth funding to the University but would have a negative impact on the state's economy. I would urge you to think very carefully before precipitating action which may be injurious to this University and to the State.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is pretty good sounding stuff until you actually analyse it. It was a good throwaway line but it does not stand up to analysis. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7815"> These days the private paying student who wants to go to university will make an assessment of the cost. The University of Tasmania now charges an up-front fee of about $760 for students in a three&hyphen;year degree and $1,265 for a five-year course, courtesy of the student union compulsory fee. What a disincentive that is if you are trying to attract students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the vice&hyphen;chancellor's allegation about facilities and student numbers, let me remind him that, in Western Australia as a result of legislation passed in December 1994, there is complete voluntary student unionism in that state. And guess what, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor? Shock, horror! Students are still graduating from those campuses; they are still getting an education; they are still getting quality degrees that are still getting recognised; and they are still getting jobs. It has not in any shape or form impacted on the academic life or on the student numbers at the campuses in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As to the suggestion by the vice&hyphen;chancellor on what might happen with overseas students, let us have a look at the figures in Western Australia&mdash;I never thought of looking up these figures, might I add, until I received the vice&hyphen;chancellor's letter last night. In Western Australia, in 1995, the first year of voluntary student unionism, the commencing overseas student numbers increased by 28.7 per cent, and in 1996 they increased by 19.35 per cent. If we compare that with Tasmania, in 1995 the commencing overseas student numbers went up by 15.5 per cent, and in 1996 they went down 21.9 per cent. I wonder why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the vice&hyphen;chancellor honestly invites us to believe that overseas students are making a choice of campus on the basis of compulsory student unionism, I would have thought the comparison between Western Australia and Tasmania would be a stark reminder to him that his assertions in the last paragraph of his letter are completely and utterly unsustainable. I am sure that the vice&hyphen;chancellor did not intend to mislead in relation to his assertions and that his suggestions were simply made out of ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Dr David Kemp) about the plight of Miss Dare. The letter read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plight of Karen Dare is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To think a student's academic career can be cut off because of her refusal to join the student union is both anachronistic and draconian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Miss Dare has been debarred from the University of Tasmania because of her principled refusal to pay the student union fee of $253.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This student (an Abstudy recipient) worked last year to help her through University. Rather than finding her enterprise and initiative being rewarded she finds she must submit her conscience to the all powerful University administration or be denied her rights to study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge that you take urgent action to deny the University administration the power to levy compulsory student union fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I await your urgent response.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And I wrote in similar terms to the state Minister for Education and Vocational Training. I have received a response from the federal minister for education and I wish to read that to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Abetz</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 20 October 1997 concerning the plight of Karen Dare and compulsory student unionism at the University of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sympathetic with Ms Dare's situation and the situation of all those who are forced to pay compulsory student union fees. I am considering the Commonwealth's options on voluntary student unionism as I share your concerns. I have already sought legal advice on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will write to you again once I have received further advice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me say that thousands of students around this country would welcome that letter from Dr Kemp. We must wait and see what that further legal advice might be. But to have the sympathetic ear of the minister is something that I am sure Miss Dare is very appreciative of and something which thousands of students around this country would also appreciate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Compulsory student unionism is a blot on tertiary life in this country. It is enforced by second&hyphen;rate shop stewards of university administrations&mdash;a comment which, I might add, the vice&hyphen;chancellor in his letter to me found both gratuitous and insulting. Let me say to him in return: if the hat fits, wear it. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7816"> There is no alleged service or amenity provided by a student union in this country that is of such great moment that it requires the compulsory fee to be elevated to a claim higher than that of the student's right to obtain a tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Miss Dare deserves our support; the university deserves our disdain. Miss Dare's courage is commendable; the university's draconian debarment of her is condemnable. Miss Dare's principles are honourable; the university's stance and action are devoid of any principle. I wish Miss Dare all the best in her fight with the university and I trust that, very shortly, we will see true voluntary student unionism and the right to freedom of association enshrined in this country for all tertiary students.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7816"><TITLE>Prescription Drugs&mdash;PBS Delisting</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to move on from student politics to an issue of concern to a lot of people&mdash;that is, the issue of drugs; not illegal drugs but legal drugs. I draw people's attention to a throwaway line in the press clippings of the most recent budget in May of this year. Fact sheet No. 7 from the Department of Health and Family Services states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two other drugs to be deleted are prescription drugs to treat minor nail infections. Their deletion from the Schedule will make up $75 million of an overall $112 in savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The drugs in question are terbinafine and amorolfine. Both are used for the treatment of tinea type conditions, dermatophytes, and particularly a disease called onychomycosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some questions about this issue were raised in the first round of estimates after the budget. Not a great deal of information was forthcoming and a number of questions were placed on notice. But the reaction that I received from asking those questions and stirring up the issue was quite interesting. I was contacted by the Australasian College of Dermatologists, dermatologists and professors of dermatology from major teaching universities in this country&mdash;people of that ilk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department and Senator Herron, who was the minister at the table in the estimates committee at the time, were unable to tell me 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the incidence of this disease. I had been given evidence from research from the UK which indicated that the incidence of this disease in the UK was about 2.7 per cent. But I was told that we were not able to be told what the incidence of this disease was in Australia. I have since learnt from the Australasian College of Dermatologists that about half a million Australians suffer from this disease. So, depending on what you take Australia's population to be, we are fairly close to that 2.5 per cent rate of incidence. That means that about 2&half; people in every 100 have this disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Onychomycosis is a disease that is more prevalent in the elderly. It is a disease that may or may not cause problems and is often associated with whitish&hyphen;yellow discolouring and disfigurement of either fingers or toenails. The group that I have a great deal of concern about in relation to this disease are those people who have an impairment in their peripheral vascular circulation and those people who have an immune problem. Certainly from the evidence that I have been provided with by various experts around this country, my concerns are more than well founded. The experts tell me that it can cause considerable problems for patients with diabetes, for people with peripheral vascular disease, and also for people with HIV and other immuno&hyphen;depressant conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about immuno&hyphen;depressant conditions we are not just making the assumption that everybody who has that condition has something like HIV, as people may want to put all sorts of very negative and incorrect value judgments on that. We are talking about people who have had renal transplants, people who have had heart transplants, people with leukaemia, people who have a disease that is affecting their immune system and also people who are having their immune system depressed as part of their medical treatment for another problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want these people to have a reservoir or potential reservoir of infection. That is what can cause onychomycosis. It can cause fissures and cracking in the skin in the toes. The first thing that I was taught when I was nursing was to be careful with diabetic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7817"> patients and that only a podiatrist should attend to their toenail cutting and feet care. It had to be done by professionals because of the risk of getting an infection or breach of the integrity of the skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last couple of days we have seen a lot of coverage of the amputations that have been caused by the meningococcal septicaemia outbreak. They are traumatic. It is very sad and I feel very sorry for the children and families involved and affected by that, but it affects only a small number. There would be hundreds of diabetics in this country who each year lose toes, feet or legs because they have had an infection in their foot and they have ended up with dry gangrene, and the only way to treat that is to amputate. I do not have the figures but I would suggest to everybody listening&mdash;and I am sure the professionals would back me up&mdash;that a number of these amputations could have been avoided if the patients had been cured of onychomycosis because that disease would have contributed to their problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treatment that the department and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has said should be used is griseofulvin, not terbinafine which is taken orally. The research that I have been provided with indicates that griseofulvin has a maximum efficacy rate, a cure rate, of 40 per cent and the length of treatment time required is between 18 months and two years. The efficacy of terbinafine, depending on which source you read, can be as high as 80 or 90 per cent for a three&hyphen;month course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that people face with the prescription and the use of medication is patient compliance. If you asked somebody to comply to regularly take medication every day for two years you would have a much greater risk of non-compliance than if you asked somebody to take medication for only three months. Any woman who has had to take the oral contraceptive pill will certainly be aware that it is not a hard thing to do to forget the damn thing. But we are not talking about the risk of pregnancy here; we are talking about the risk of losing a limb if this disease cannot be cured.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have grave concerns that terbinafine will be off the PBS list from 1 November this year. It will make it impossible for anybody, except the very wealthy, to be able to afford to undertake a three&hyphen;month course. It has certainly been put to me by the experts in the field that by far, whilst terbinafine might be more expensive, it is certainly more cost&hyphen;effective than griseofulvin. It has less side effects than griseofulvin. It has less drug interactions than griseofulvin. It is the side effects and drug interactions of griseofulvin that will cause less patient compliance and reduce the potential 40 per cent cure rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From one of my sources at the Royal Perth Hospital, we also know that onychomycosis is endemic in the Aboriginal population. If it is not cleared up it is also a source of constant reinfection. This is of course a major concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From questioning the department about this we have been told that the cost-effectiveness was not the reason for the decision. Financial considerations was the reason for the decision. In answer to a question I put on notice at the Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing on 19 August at page 114 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the department responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The differences between terbinafine and griseofulvin, in terms of efficacy and safety, were taken into account when terbinafine was listed on the PBS and provided justification for the higher price for terbinafine.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I take that as an admission from the department that the efficacy and safety of terbinafine is superior to that of griseofulvin. The department then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relative merits of the two drugs was not a factor in the decision to delist terbinafine. It is recognised that griseofulvin is a less effective drug, however, the issue is the appropriateness of the public sector expenditure resulting from the inappropriate use of terbinafine and its use for minor cases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Every one of the doctors and professors, and most of them are professors, who have written to me have all pleaded and requested that this drug remain on the PBS. They are quite happy for the authorisation of laboratory confirmation of fungal infection to be necessary before the drug is prescribed. That is what the profession would like. That is what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7818"> the profession wants. This is from the group of people who are involved in treating this disease. I think it ill behoves this government to go out there and talk about being caring, sharing and warm and fuzzy because in this situation it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as being very interesting that the minister has determined that he has a very major interest in diabetes. That is commendable because it is a major disease. It is a disease that is increasing in prevalence, particularly amongst the older age group. The minister has made the following commitments: he has identified diabetes as a national health priority. He has committed the Commonwealth government to the establishment of a diabetes register. He has given a commitment to the development of specific programs for high risk groups. Through his Ministerial Advisory Committee on Diabetes, $7.7 million has been made available for a national diabetes strategy. He has agreed to the Commonwealth entering into a $5 million joint venture with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Australia for IDDM research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are very worthy commitments but when you compare them with the removal of terbinafine in particular from the PBS then I have grave concerns. That is a public show of `Yes, I am interested, but my actions are not the same as my words'. The actions are of trying to save money and hang the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we know that maintaining skin integrity of feet, particularly for diabetics, is of major concern. Two drugs are being removed from the PBS that will help to maintain skin integrity and remove the potential for fungal infections. The Australian Podiatry Council is also concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent announcement of the government's response to the fair trading report `New Deal&mdash;Fair Deal' has met with tremendous, in fact unprecedented support from small business organisations around the country. Even the opposition have given it a tick. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, is to be congratulated for putting together a package that responds so timely and comprehensively to the needs of small business in their dealings with big business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I wish to raise the matter of a separate small business issue which relates to a taxation obstacle to competitiveness. Simply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7819"> put, if you are a small retailer, you pay more sales tax per item than big business. So you either charge more or you have smaller margins. Either way, it is hard to compete. It is killing our independent retail sector, which is losing market share at the rate of two to three per cent every year. In June 1975, the independent sector had 60 per cent of the retail grocery market. Last year, they had 23 per cent. I am told by reliable sources that that could even have slipped two to three per cent this year. No other comparable country in the world allows so much market share to end up in the hands of so few. The fair trading report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">United States antitrust laws limit the market share of the three largest food retailers to 17% of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The top three food retailers in the United States have some 12.1% of the retail market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The big three food retailers in the United Kingdom share 28% of the market.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unless this discrimination in the way sales tax is applied is addressed, small business runs the risk of losing the critical mass level of market share needed to survive. This issue tilts the field in favour of big retailers simply because they are big business. It helps them acquire more market power every year, not because they are more efficient or use economies of scale, but simply because they have their own warehouses and can apply sales tax prior to freight and service fees, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this discrimination is widely felt. Australia's independent warehouse wholesaler, Davids, had a share price of $1.15 in June and it is now 69c. Davids is crucial to the operation of independent retailers, yet this sales tax issue is crippling the ability of their customers to maintain a viable market share against the large retail chains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia says that the effect of the way sales tax is applied virtually hands the big retailers a $120 million subsidy every year. This is a huge free kick in front of the competition goal posts and results in the average small business grocer paying an extra $12,000 to $15,000 per year in tax, which makes it very difficult to compete with the big stores from the outset.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way it works is that independent retailers buy through a wholesaler while the major supermarkets buy into their own warehouses. This results in the chains paying tax on the manufacturer's selling price without taking into account freight and warehouse costs. However, independents must pay tax on the wholesaler's selling price which includes freight charged by the manufacturer and the warehouse margin. In addition, the large chains are able to base their tax calculations on the manufacturer's price net of all rebates. They can strip out discounts, allowances, rebates and settlements. But independents are unable to take into account their rebates when calculating the tax they must pay. They have to pay on the full price, not the discounted or net price. This can amount to a very substantial amount of money. In this way, major supermarket chains are receiving a competitive advantage of some $120 million a year over their small independent competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Independents in rural and far flung areas are likely to be the worst affected by the impact of sales tax on freight. We must remember that there are thousands of independent stores throughout country Australia. Many towns are too small for large retailers like Coles, Woolworths and Franklins. So country people have to bear the brunt of these increased costs. This encourages the demise of smaller towns as people decide to make the trip to larger regional centres to get the price advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out that the inequity does not arise as a result of any superior efficiency by the chains. It has nothing to do with buying power or market power. The independent warehouses have the negotiating strength to buy from manufacturers at a similar price to the chains. They also have similar warehousing and distribution costs and provide similar retail services such as advertising, retail counselling, space management and IT support. But because sales tax is applied at the last wholesale price, the independent retailer ends up paying 13 per cent or more in extra sales tax on a wide range of items. Independent retailers pay around 2.5c more for a can of Pal and around 3c more on a bottle of Coke, compared to the chains.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7820">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For every $100 worth of groceries sold, an average independent grocer will pay 75 cents more in sales tax than the big chains. If the average weekly grocery turnover is $30,000&mdash;and that would be a very small grocery shop&mdash;the small business operator is paying $225 more in tax per week and $12,000 more sales tax per year than the big business competitor pays on the same volume.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I know that surprises Senator O'Chee who is very interested in small business. Where net profit margins are in the order of two, three or four per cent, as they tend to be in this industry, it is extremely difficult for small business to compete successfully. If average weekly grocery sales are $80,000, then the independent is paying an extra $31,200 per year in tax above what the big chain competition is required to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way sales tax is applied it effectively discriminates against small business and plays a significant role in the steady decline of the market share of independents every year. Furthermore, as pointed out by the national association of retail grocers, the cost to government has reached more than $40 million a year from sales tax no longer paid due to the increase in market share of the chains from 40 per cent to more than 75 per cent over the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The association makes the observation that for every one per cent of market share that shifts from the independents to the big chains, sales tax revenue actually drops by $1.5 million. The way that sales tax is being applied serves only to help the chains grow at the expense of the independents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition in Australia's retail sector is stifled by the market power held in just three hands. Coles, Myers and Woolworths now share between them around 63 per cent of the market. Yesterday, the Managing Director of Woolworths said that by the year 2000, the top two food retailers will have 70 per cent of the market. Right now, small business in the food sector runs the risk of losing its critical mass level. They simply cannot afford to give 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up any more market share if their distribution system is to remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An annual handicap of $12,000 makes it extraordinarily difficult for small business operators to compete&mdash;and that would be only a very small store. Imagine the alternative uses for that $12,000, or $31,200 if the grocer has weekly sales of $80,000, especially in terms of increasing employment. It is not just happening in the food sector. Hardware stores, newsagents and pharmacies are all affected by this inequitable way of applying sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has pledged to support newsagents and pharmacies in the Hilmer review process. But if government submissions are overridden by the competition tribunal and large chains are able to move further in on these retailers, then there will be a totally unacceptable increase in market power to the retail giants, aided and abetted by this inequitable application of sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Woolworths has just posted a 10.66 per cent increase in first quarter sales. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported yesterday that Managing Director of Woolworths, Reg Clairs, said that Big W grew partly because it had successfully competed against chemists in the cosmetics market and against stationery suppliers in the office supply sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever sales tax is applied, these big chains have an in&hyphen;built advantage which helps them take market share off independent family owned businesses. The whole situation discriminates against small business and their ability to compete, through no fault of their own. The discrimination results in more small businesses going to the wall, less competition in an already highly concentrated market and ties up valuable capital which could be used to improve competitiveness and boost employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation has reached a critical stage which must be addressed before the continued viability of the independent sector is compromised. With the present rate of market share shifting to the chains, the independent sector cannot afford to wait for major tax reform several years down the track. By then they would have lost another six to eight per cent of market share and their viability would be unsustainable. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7821">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue must be addressed now. Australia has allowed these retail giants to accumulate all this market power. The current system of sales tax is helping them get more and is handing more market share to the big retailers on a platter. Now comes the crunch. Do we let them take over everything or do we give small business an even break by making both big and small pay sales tax at the same point in the retail chain? What could be fairer and more equitable than that?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7821"><TITLE>Youth Unemployment</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise as a matter of public interest and importance today the vexed question of youth unemployment and the government's work for the dole pilot scheme, particularly as it affects New South Wales. When the government first announced its plans to establish this scheme, it had intended to select just 70 groups to provide work for 10,000 young recipients on a trial basis. After applications for sponsors opened, in the first week alone almost 100 organisations had already applied to participate in the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This overwhelming response and demand led the government to announce last week that the number of work for the dole projects would be expanded to 178. A total of 10,434 places will be available for participants, of whom at least 80 per cent will be young people between 18 and 24 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands, 630 applications for funding have been received. Hundreds of additional projects will be considered next year. This leads to the question as to why the government has implemented work for the dole in the first place and why it has generated such a positive community response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported recently that 3.3 million full-time retrenchments had occurred since 1986. With the teenage full-time unemployment trend rate at around 29 per cent when the coalition took government in 1996, there is no doubt that a proportion of these jobs were those of young people in industries which are now all but obsolete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that after 13 years in power Labor failed to adequately address one of the great 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> est serious challenges facing our nation&mdash;that of youth unemployment. When the coalition came to office, youth unemployment was as high as 30 per cent in some regional areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Working Nation program, which was Labor's response to the unemployment crisis, was&mdash;I think it is fair to say&mdash;a dismal failure. Between July 1990 and March 1996, Labor's policies added only an additional 7,100 full&hyphen;time jobs. Many Working Nation programs simply did not lead to real jobs. For example, only 22 per cent of participants in the new work opportunities program ended up in unsubsidised employment, despite it costing over $10,000 per person to participate in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is therefore a necessary scheme, in a<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">broader range of initiatives, to tackle youth unemployment. Communities are prepared to financially support people who do not have a job. In return, it is fair and reasonable to ask those receiving this support to put something back into their community for a couple of days a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government provided $21.6 million in the May 1997 budget for the work for the dole initiative. More than $15 million is provided to fund projects and participant allowances. The remaining funds are for monitoring, assessment and administration. Twenty to 30 pilots will take place in regional and rural areas with high levels of unemployment. It is expected that several thousand young people will work on projects under these pilots. Participants will work for two six&hyphen;hour days if aged 18 to 20, and 2&half; six&hyphen;hour days if 20 or over. Participants will be paid an extra $10 a week in recognition of the unavoidable costs of working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects will be for a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 months. Organisations selected to participate in the scheme and future participants have been or will be selected on the basis of criteria which include: the capacity of the sponsor to monitor and maintain the project; the extent of contribution and support for the particular project that comes from the local community; the quality of community involvement; and the willing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7822"> ness to support the participants after completion of placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All projects must directly benefit the community and not a private business. A condition of each project is that it does not replace or substitute for paid jobs. A person may be required to participate in a work for the dole project only if they are in receipt of the full unemployment allowance and there is no risk to personal health or any other contravention of occupational health and safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects must provide participants with a variety of tasks, challenges and responsibility, opportunities to work in teams and mix with people and, perhaps most importantly, a sense of pride in their work and achievements. While some projects may include a training element, the<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">objective is to instil the discipline of the workplace and to help break the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that many young people experience and which is so soul destroying. The work for the dole initiative is based on a principle of mutual obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some examples in NSW of some of these valuable projects. New South Wales has a total of 54 projects with 4021 participants. The variety and nature of the work offered to the young unemployed are truly encouraging. Whilst developing skills in various fields and being exposed to a work ethic, young people are also able to make a positive contribution to many worthwhile projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following are some prime examples in New South Wales. The Penrith 2000 Olympics regatta project in Sydney is to be carried out in conjunction with the Penrith Lakes Development Corporation, the Olympic Coordination Authority and Penrith council. Work includes the planting of wetland plants in the practice and catchment lakes of the Sydney International Regatta Centre, which will improve rowing conditions and rejuvenation of the Nepean River adjacent to the regatta centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that the Nepean River site will be visited by thousands of local and overseas tourists before and during the 2000 Olympics. A walkway along the Nepean River from Penrith station to the regatta 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centre has been proposed. In addition to gaining job skills, the participants working on the project will be making a rewarding contribution to both the environment and the staging of the all&hyphen;important 2000 Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The early migrant oral history project involves the publishing of oral history of migrants in the historic St George community in the Hurstville area. Participants will interview selected residents, and document and publish their stories. They will also collect and reproduce historic photographs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The participants will learn a variety of interview and communication techniques and gain some practical experience in using recording devices, dictaphones, photographic replication equipment, computers, and desktop publishing software. Besides gaining practical skills, participants will gain an appreciation of the experiences of local migrants and help preserve local community heritage. It is making the links in a community that is going to be so important in that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other projects include Mission Australia at Cabramatta Multicultural Employment Services and the restoration of community sites. A very important one is the CSA Training Services' Royal National Park preservation of sites, which aims to involve indigenous young people in midden stabilisation, campsite revegetation, track restoration and nursery establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liverpool Regional Museum project at Liverpool involves renovation of the Liverpool Regional Museum. The Bankstown Aviation Museum project provides work experience for participants in conjunction with the development of the Bankstown Aviation Museum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Blue Mountains community work for the dole project will be work experience with community organisations, involving office work, building and grounds maintenance, and personal care. Leichhardt Uniting Church recreation and socialisation in aged care project will assist in providing care and support for the elderly. The Salvation Army build a boat project involves construction of a boat in inner Sydney.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7823">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regional NSW the variety and importance of projects are again apparent. The Cootamundra Workskills project at West Wyalong includes entry beautification, the West Wyalong green corridor extension and the painting of heritage shop facades. The Barmedman main street and mineral pool projects will beautify shopfronts and street&hyphen;scapes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tamworth Training Services will provide work experience in the all&hyphen;important tourism and hospitality sector. In Shoalhaven, the employment and training group will provide work experience in hospitals, aged care centres, golf club and churches. The Lions Club of Hunter Wallsend and the Shortland Wetlands Centre at Maryland project will include: construction of a new entry and walkway to the main visitors centre; construction of an exhibition centre; a sensory trail; improvement and extension of the existing walking trail; and rehabilitation of the wetland. In my home town of Wagga Wagga, Mission Australia will be involved in the establishment of a shopfront where collected clothing is recycled and sold to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the scheme must be viewed as part of a whole-of-government approach and cannot be looked at in isolation. It is part of an overall package to deal with one of the biggest issues facing our nation&mdash;youth unemployment. In conjunction with work for the dole, the government is delivering on its promise to increase genuine job opportunities for young Australians. The new national apprenticeship system will provide trainees with world-class skills, giving Australian businesses a competitive edge in the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government will provide a total of more than $1.3 billion for vocational education and training in 1997&hyphen;98. It includes $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98. The new apprenticeships and traineeships will be in high-growth industries, such as technology, finance, tourism and hospitality, sport and the traditional trades. In 1996-97 there was a record level of traineeship commencements&mdash;more than 51,000 commencements&mdash;representing a 44 per cent increase on the previous year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, under the new apprenticeship system the skills and qualifications of all new apprentices and trainees will be recognised in all states and territories, greatly expanding job and career options. Employers can choose who will deliver the off-the-job training for their apprentices and trainees&mdash;either a private provider or a public TAFE provider. It will be easier for employers to hire an apprentice or a trainee. One-stop apprenticeship shops will combine Commonwealth and state services under one roof. Students will be able to earn while they learn by combining a paid new apprenticeship with their secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A package of measures totalling more than $187 million over four years has been established to expand vocational education and training in schools. This will expand career options and opportunities for the 60 per cent of students not<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> going to full-time university or TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its first term, the government has committed almost four times as much funding for vocational education training in schools as the Labor Party provided over 13 years. In calendar year 1998, $891 million will be provided for TAFE and other training providers through the Australian National Training Authority. This will build on the additional 43,000 student places forecast to be available this year through Commonwealth growth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community interest in the scheme shows that the scheme has popular support. Whilst unemployment continues, unfortunately, to be one of the greatest challenges facing Australia, it is pleasing to note that under the coalition government the situation is improving slowly. DSS figures showed that more that 11,000 jobseekers got off the dole queue in September. The 1.7 per cent drop caused the total number of jobseekers to fall to 660,167 from the previous month. The 11,244&mdash;or 3.5 per cent&mdash;decrease in the number of short-term jobseekers was indeed welcome news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is but one initiative, but it is an important initiative in combating youth unemployment together with the other initiatives. There were so many suitable projects around the country and, as this is a pilot initiative, an attempt is now being made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7824"> to select the widest range of project types possible as well as to achieve a broad geographical spread of projects. It is very good news for those young people who will be able to access the undoubted benefits of this initiative and break the cycle of despair of youth unemployment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7824"><TITLE>Western Reds Rugby League Football Club</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the matters of public interest debate today to take an unusual tack. I want to raise a Western Australian concern, which is the announcement of the closure of the Western Reds Rugby League Football Club. While it is a sporting issue in one sense, I want to reflect on a few issues that emanate from that decision that I think ought to be of concern in the community generally, because it does raise questions about the impact of professional sport and the values of professional sport that we are teaching our children. There are issues there that we must address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that I join the debate today is to give voice to the disappointment of those members and supporters of the Western Reds Rugby League Football Club, who were shocked and extremely disappointed when an announcement was made at a press conference that the club had closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the following day, the members received&mdash;as I did&mdash;a letter from the club, indicating that the decision had been taken to close the club, because they were not to be invited into the 1998 competition. That one&hyphen;page letter from the club was effectively the end of the members' and supporters' involvement with a club that had been in existence for three years and of which many people, myself included, had been members for those three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very sad aspect of professional sport that members and supporters can be treated in this way&mdash;that the overriding concerns of professional sport concentrate on TV coverage, on the interests of television companies and of the major sponsors. I am no Luddite; I do not fail to recognise the changes that have occurred in sport and the need for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sponsorship and the impact of modern commercial realities. But it is extremely disappointing and worrying when these sorts of things occur without any membership involvement, without any participation or consultation with the people who are drawn into the life of the club and drawn into supporting and being involved in a team in whatever code of sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, members were not consulted or involved and were merely informed suddenly that the club they had supported for three years had closed. People had developed an emotional and financial involvement with that enterprise. People had been members for up to three years. They had bought game seats. They had bought the merchandise&mdash;the caps, the shirts, the badges. They had shown loyalty; it had become part of their lives in the way that many of us who belong to sporting clubs do let a team become part of our lives. But, because of the dispute between Super League and the ARL and the associated developments in rugby league, the decision to close the only Western Australian based club was taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some real implications there for the future of sport, the values we are teaching our children and the values which we hold as a community. I do not think it is acceptable to say, `That's professional sport, that's the way it is. You have to cop it.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that lots of other clubs and people have been through this before, and this is not a new experience. I know the supporters of Fitzroy in the AFL and obviously Hunter in the Super League competition are currently going through similar sorts of experiences, so I do not claim there is anything unique about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7825"> the experience of the Western Reds. But it was brought home to me when I had to explain it to my six&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son, whom I had taken along to the games in the last year or so, together with my father.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My six&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son has become quite an enthusiastic supporter&mdash;although he seems to enjoy the marching girls as much as he does the rugby, I must say! He is learning to read and he noticed the story on the back of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper and asked me about it. I had a great deal of difficulty explaining to him what had occurred and what was going on here. I said, `Well, the club's closed. They're not playing next year. No, we won't be going next year.' This is at the same time as I am trying to teach him about the proper values of sport&mdash;that sport is for enjoyment, it is about taking part. I am trying to teach him not to be too competitive, to teach him about loyalty to the team and the club, and playing sport for all the positive values that it can encourage in young people. I was very hard&hyphen;pressed to explain what seemed to be a very cynical decision in terms of the future of the club that he had come to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of days later he noticed another aspect of professional sport which was a report, again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, which referred to the fact that a prominent member of the Fremantle Dockers Australian Rules football team&mdash;Mr Matthew&mdash;better known as `Spider'&mdash;Burton, might not be on their playing list next year. Spider Burton is a bit of a cult figure in Western Australia, and small boys in particular seem to like and admire him greatly. I do not know whether it is because he is almost seven feet tall, but he has this sort of appeal to both young and old. He is a very committed footballer and, by all reports, is a very genuine and well respected young man. But this report was about how, because of injury problems and the issues of the salary cap, he may not be invited to play with the team again next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I had to try to explain to my son why Spider Burton perhaps would not be playing with the Fremantle Dockers next season. What do I say to him about the values involved in that? It is very hard to explain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the salary cap and the commercial pressures on the club. The fact that the player had given loyal service and was a committed and skilful player were not really considerations that were going to be prominent in decisions about his future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Western Australians will know, there has been a similar debate about Peter Sumich from the West Coast Eagles, who is a very well regarded Western Australian footballer and, obviously, there are a number of footballers who have been traded in the draft recently and have gone to other states and clubs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found all these things very hard to explain to my son. I think they raise serious issues about the values we are teaching young people and what they can learn from professional sport in this country and internationally. I do not have the answers to these concerns. I raise them because I think it is important that we start to debate some of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also my intention to place on the record the disappointment of supporters and to give voice to their concerns, a number of which have been raised with me by fellow members of the club. I indicate also that this is not a criticism of the club's administrators or its chairman, Mr Stephen Edwards, who I think have done a good job in all the circumstances. It is not their fault. It is a question of the commercial realities and the decisions of the owners of the competition, but it is a very disappointing development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also place on record our thanks to the players. Despite not being in the finals, the Western Reds always gave good entertainment and wholehearted commitment. They were a good team to follow. We had full commitment from the players, who earned the respect of the supporters and the Western Australian public generally. But I do think that this development has seriously harmed the future of rugby league in Western Australia. It has made people far more cynical about sport and rugby league. I do not want to enter into the debate about Super League versus the ARL&mdash;I have failed to be impressed by either side in this dispute, because I do not think it has ever been about sport or the interests of rugby 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7826"> league&mdash;but the decision in relation to the Western Reds has set rugby league back a long way in Western Australia. There are a number of supporters and members who will be far more reluctant next time to commit themselves to joining and supporting a rugby league club in Western Australia. That is a sad thing, but people have been burnt by the experience, and I think they are now more cynical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of more importance to really ask questions about this sort of decision and activity in professional sport&mdash;that is, the closing of clubs for financial reasons or for purposes driven by television needs, the transfer of players and the buying and selling of players. All these things really send out messages that run contrary to what we all profess to want to teach our children, and what we want to encourage in sport. I think we are giving a very mixed message about sport in this country. I do not pretend to have the answers. I think we do have to look at the development of professional sport and some of the values that surround it and ask ourselves whether those are really the examples and the values that we want to be encouraging, and have our children observe and mimic, as undoubtedly they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of values I described earlier&mdash;that is, encouraging sport for enjoyment, the taking part, the friendships, the physical activity, the learning of positive interaction with others and loyalty&mdash;are far more important values and I think they are threatened by some of the developments in professional sport. They are certainly not values one would learn from observing professional sport or some of the developments that accompany professional sport in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a brief from the Minister for Finance and Administration on the issue of the implications for IT outsourcing of the merger of DAS and Finance. You will be aware, Senator Murphy, that on 5 October 1997 the government announced that the Department of Administrative Services would be abolished and its functions transferred to other agencies, including the new Department of Finance and Administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change will have a minimal impact on the OGIT cluster 3 outsourcing initiative, which will now comprise the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, the Australian Electoral Commission and the former DAS customer base now being managed by the Department of Finance and Administration.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IT support for DAS functions transferred to the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism will remain in cluster 3.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, the Native Title Act amendments do not involve the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. We have accepted the Wik decision in full. The Wik decision said that native title may not necessarily have been extinguished on pastoral leases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the parliament to the deficiencies in the current act. It was not designed to deal with the possibility of native title surviving on pastoral leases. It is like a model&hyphen;T Ford that you put on the racetrack in Melbourne for the Grand Prix&mdash;it is simply not up to the job. The Native Title Act has to be redesigned to accommodate the fact that we must now deal with the co&hyphen;existence of native title on pastoral leases&mdash;something which the Native Title Act was not intended to do, and the ALP well knows that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was passed on the presumption that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. As a reflection of the failing of the current act and the current arrangements, we now have in the native title system over 600 claims covering nearly 50 per cent of the Australian mainland, and we have had only one determination. After five years of native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7828"> title, four years of the Native Title Act, we have had one determination, and that was by agreement. The only Australians who are exercising determined native title rights are in fact the Murray Islanders. They are the only people in Australia who actually are exercising today determined native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act has virtually no threshold test, and you know that. We have the real and manifest problem of multiple and overlapping claims right around Australia. These are causing conflict within Aboriginal communities as well as between Aborigines and other Australians. We have absolutely no workable agreements provisions in the current act. It is a major deficiency in the current act, one that we will fix. The current system is collapsing under the weight of the system which it was not designed to cope with. The current act is simply not delivering for any Australians, including Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will do in the Native Title Amendment Bill is fix up those problems. We will incorporate the Wik decision into the Native Title Act to ensure that we have a workable system of coexistence on pastoral leases and one which reflects the native title decision found in Wik&mdash;that is, that, where native title has survived on a pastoral lease, the pastoralists' rights will prevail. The effect of the current Native Title Act is actually to reverse that decision and means that pastoralists may well be finding themselves acting illegally in exercising legal rights under their lease, and that was made clear in the Attorney-General's advice which was released in January. I think that is the issue which most Australians fail to accommodate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will and I will quote some very useful supporting evidence. The fact is that very many young Australians were looking forward to a decent Christmas present&mdash;the opportunity to get a full&hyphen;time job. What we have seen as a result of this negative, short&hyphen;sighted, opportunistic decision, simply pandering to your trade union masters, is once again a cruel blow, not only to those young people looking for work but also for small businesses which are desperately keen to expand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been described as a confidence building initiative and it would have been just that. It would have provided the opportunity to allow them to be free from the very onerous obligations that could be imposed from long drawn&hyphen;out litigation that small business is particularly ill&hyphen;equipped to cope with. We are not the first ones to recognise this. You can go back to 1982 when the Wran government actually introduced an employment protection act which recognised special considerations for firms with less than 15 employees. So this is very bad news indeed for the work force and particularly the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cheryl Kernot, of course, recognised this when she told Mr Reith in November 1996 that the Democrats would support exempting small business from the harsh, unjust and unreasonable section of the Workplace Relations Act in relation to unfair dismissals. Of course, the Labor Party itself knows that this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7830"> would be good news for small business but they are simply not allowed by their trade union masters to go down this path. They are utterly beholden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of Labor's approach on this and a whole range of issues is that they somehow think they can reinvent themselves by looking offshore and pointing to Tony Blair. The fact is that Tony Blair happens to be the political son that Margaret Thatcher never had. You continue to demonise Tony Blair when, in fact, as Paul Kelly said in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Blair has accepted Thatcher's `reforms of deregulation, privatisation and laws that weaken union power.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened, of course, is that both Cheryl Kernot and Kim Beazley have fallen for the blur rather than the Blair. They think that somehow a few stage&hyphen;managed soft events will substitute for the hard yard. They think politics is the land of the photo opportunity; that a few hand&hyphen;wringing gestures to interest groups and a couple of doe&hyphen;eyed smiles for the TV cameras will get you across the line. The fact is, of course, that if you really want to take notice of Blair you will look at his policies and you will understand what he is about. Let me tell you what he told the trade union movement only last month. He said, `You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place.' Absolutely right!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about it, Tony Blair would have supported this legislation. Tony Blair knows that small business is the engine of growth. Small business is where people look to for job opportunities. But you lot, because you are locked in the mire, because you are not allowed to do anything the trade union movement does not approve of, you put the interest of young Australians last. It is a great tragedy. I suggest you use the Christmas period to go off and study Tony Blair in action. Look at what he really stands for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don't just look at a few television grabs and think he looks like a nice bloke. You have a got a decent bloke leading you and he is taking you nowhere; that is your problem. Even Cheryl Kernot recognised that the other day. Asked if he would inspire, after a preg

Reflecting the very significant falls in mortgage rates achieved since the coalition's election victory, headline inflation fell 0.3 per cent in the year to September and, as we already know, there were substantial falls in mortgage interest charges.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for the question. Circumstances certainly are serious, as Senator Harradine has indicated. Senator Harradine might recall that Australia was asked for expert assistance to support the PNG National Disaster Committee. As a result of that, we sent two teams to PNG: one to undertake a rapid assessment of urgent food, water and health needs and the other to develop a longer term agricultural recovery strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the first of those teams produced a preliminary assessment report on the situation last week which, in fact, found it to be much more serious than first envisaged. In particular, they have found that in excess of 500,000 people required immediate food relief assistance&mdash;there is a view that this number could grow rapidly over the next few weeks if seasonal rains due in early November do not eventuate&mdash;and have found that the most affected provinces were in the eastern and southern highlands, followed by Enga and Madang. However, results were nevertheless patchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the serious threat of deterioration in the supply of staple food crops and water supplies in many areas. In fact, the water shortage problems in PNG are described as serious. This leads to, of course, concerns about dysentery outbreaks, the closing down of health clinics and the halt in processing of staple foods in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, we sought to supply air transport to deliver relief supplies to the worst affected areas. An RAAF Caribou arrived in PNG on Monday the 20th. We are currently mobilising 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aircraft in response to PNG's request for additional assistance with the delivery of emergency relief supplies. AusAID has made the first delivery under a $1.2 million package of medical aid, which was delivered last week. I understand that the second delivery is due to arrive in PNG today, Senator Harradine. An officer of Emergency Management Australia is continuing his work with the National Disaster Emergency Service to help coordinate the relief exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government does reaffirm its willingness to assist the government of PNG where required. As I have said, we have provided $1.7 million of assistance to date. Additional assistance will be determined by the government of PNG in response to the assessment report to which I referred. Therefore, we are keeping in very close contact with the PNG government and wish to be supportive in every way we can in these very difficult circumstances for a very near and close neighbour.</PARA>

That happens in effect both now and under the Labor Party's entry bond in relation to hostels. Under their contribution scheme, where people agree to a bond but die before they paid, the estate becomes responsible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Read all the standing orders. For Senator Tierney's benefit, the government said at the outset that this would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be the panacea for small to medium enterprises in the information technology area in this country; that this would be the generator of employment that Senator Tierney spoke about. I would be very interested to know, and I know there are a lot of small to medium enterprise industries which also would like to know, how the government will bring that about. At this point in time all the government has done is let contracts worth significant amounts of money without the slightest competitive tendering process&mdash;there has not been one iota of a competitive tendering process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that this is the position that has been publicly conveyed both by this government and by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and yet the only decisions put into practice are those that exclude the rights of companies to competitively tender for these contracts. As I said, probably only three major multinational companies have the capacity to tender for these contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the small to medium enterprises that will generate all the jobs for Australian workers, we ask: how do they get into the game? That is something that they have been asking also: `How do we get into the game?' Look at the circumstances in the case of IBM&hyphen;GSA. They have small enterprises around the world that they subcontract to. I put it to the government that it is quite conceivable that they will use the companies that they have an association with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many companies which have relied for a considerable period of time on government business in the IT area, some of them based here in Canberra. I want to hear from the government what they intend to do to ensure that these companies get a fair crack at the IT outsourcing contract. Despite the fact that the government has said, `We want to see 15 per cent of the contract subcontracted to small to medium enterprises,' I have not seen anything that indicates that they necessarily have to be Australian enterprises, that they have to be Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I think is causing a significant amount of concern, but even more so is that we have not even had a competitive tender yet&mdash;not one has been called. You have this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7844"> situation where first the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) says, `Okay, we're going to go down this proper process.' The government is all about competition&mdash;fairness and equity. So next we put together the clusters. Perhaps John Fahey should be called the `cluster buster', because we have not had a cluster yet that has held together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question that must be raised with the government is what happens when you change your mind like you did with the Department of Administrative Services, when you all of a sudden bowled them out and chucked them in with Finance. We have seen an announcement, as Senator Lundy pointed out, that now they are part of the piggyback on the DVA contract&mdash;no competitive tender again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson, I can see you sitting over there with a wry smile on your face. I do not think you for one would support this process where there is no competition. I have heard you get up in this place many times and talk about competition, particularly when you were a parliamentary secretary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I rise to respond to Senator Lundy's question earlier about the IT outsourcing. Let us look at the history of all this: why is the government endeavouring to improve efficiency of the operation of the administration of government? Because the Labor Party left us with a mess. The other side were the group that raised taxes by 30 per cent in the last four years of their government, sold off $9 billion worth of silver, increased borrowings by $70 billion and left us with a mess. We are cleaning up the mess and part of that is by greatly improving the efficiency of the operations of the Australian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that, we are continuing a process which the Labor government started of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outsourcing the IT works within the government, except that we are doing it in a more comprehensive way, but the design was basically set in your day. Tenders were called for the first group of contracts for the veterans' affairs department. As Senator Lundy knows, this matter about the history of what happened and how there was nothing improper done has been well and truly canvassed during Senate estimates&mdash;over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Murphy knows, I am in favour of strong competition but, because there was an opportunity to piggyback on this particular contract with the Department of Finance, the government decided to go ahead with it and save many millions of dollars rather than wait for a considerable period before the next opportunity to go with another cluster. In the interests of the poor battling taxpayers of Australia, the government made a decision to go ahead with this particular contract and to add Finance into the contract&mdash;it was in the original design of the contract to allow that to happen. But that really is only a minor affair. The greater affair is the design for the rest of the Commonwealth IT work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Senator Lundy would agree with me that the design of calling competitive tenders for those clusters&mdash;and, as Minister Fahey said, including encouraging Australian firms to be part of the tender process&mdash;is the right way for us to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having heard Senator Gibson, I think the other side has lost the plot on this one. I indicate that I am not on any committee considering any report that is coming before this chamber. Senator Gibson really raised the issue about the poor battling taxpayer when he said that what has been done has been for the poor battling taxpayer. The one thing that this coalition promised when they were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7845"> heading for government was transparency, openness, and the very thing that we do not have here today is transparency and openness. What we have is a government which has piggybacked contract upon contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the original DVA contract, as I understand it, it was not a cluster contract; it was a contract simply for DVA and, as a result, no other departments were taken into consideration and no other needs were taken into consideration. No-one is doubting the transparency of the process there. If one looks at the estimates process, one will find that there was lengthy questioning to the representatives of the Department of Veterans' Affairs about the DVA contract and its transparency, and I do not think anyone brought into doubt that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is at stake is that we now have piggybacking on piggybacking; we have DAS going into Finance going into DVA. This loses sight of all of what this government proclaimed that they stood for&mdash;openness and transparency. If the poor battling taxpayers, as Senator Gibson describes them, are to be taken into consideration, then this government should have addressed this issue in a much better manner than they have done today. It is not a minor affair; it is very important that transparency is seen in these operations. As my colleagues Senator Murphy and Senator Lundy have pointed out before, this is about competition: seeing that contracts are openly and transparently competed for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can already see some instances of this government's approach to IT outsourcing. What about the Russell Offices&mdash;the Department of Defence? They not only let the contract once, but had to stop the process and re&hyphen;let it because there was a mess&hyphen;up. One must have transparency at all costs. One must have the ability to see that there has been competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the furphy that the government put up, that this is about making things more dynamic and efficient, that has yet to be proven. There is no proof at this stage that that will necessarily be the case. All that we have seen so far in the tendering process is that small to medium sized enterprises, which this government so often claims to champion, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been left out on a limb. The big winners, as my colleagues have pointed out, have been the multinationals. As Senator Murphy said&mdash;and I agree&mdash;the only winners are the multinationals. So much for the creation of jobs in Australia, and that is what this is really about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government were half serious about bringing forward an IT outsourcing program, they would ensure that it leads to growth in the number of jobs. But they cannot prove that that is the case anywhere. All they are doing is leaving the Australian public in the lurch and helping someone to provide a job to someone else overseas. That is beyond doubt.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could not even sustain your genuineness on the aged care issue. I would have thought that you would have picked up today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. I was all geared up for it; I was happy to defend the government's policy on aged care. I would have thought you would have been able to sustain an attempt at genuineness on this issue and raise it during the time for debating motions to take note of answers. Instead, you have reverted to a fringe, Canberra&hyphen;ised issue on information technology. It is a total re&hyphen;run, as was stated by the previous government speaker, of an issue that does not seem to be getting anywhere, other than the fact that it allows Senator Lundy to send out copies of her speeches in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Addressing the issue itself, there have been major changes within the Public Service in Canberra, and outsourcing is one of them. They were necessary changes which were forced upon the government because of the legacy we inherited from the previous government&mdash;a legacy of a $10.5 billion budget deficit and a $100 billion government debt. Given that legacy, we had to introduce efficiencies across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did Senator Lundy, who represents the public service union in Canberra&mdash;or at least part of it&mdash;really think that one of the most inefficient areas of government could not be tackled? We have tackled it. We have brought about these changes which are designed to put the Public Service on a competitive, efficient footing. But they in no way reduce the services offered by the federal government. All of these changes are feeding into the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that outsourcing, as distasteful as it may be to the public service union, means that the private sector will now get a chance to tender for some jobs. The fact is it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a cost&hyphen;efficient operation. I challenge Senator Hogg to look back at it after six to 12 months and he will see that I am right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why you are all attacking the finance department for making one of the first moves in this area, because they have saved over $25 million over a five&hyphen;year period. That is a stunning saving.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate calls on the Prime Minister of Malaysia (Dr Mahathir Mohamad) to withdraw his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7852"> racially-loaded remarks that Jews are to be blamed for his country's financial problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This matter is important not only because the Malaysian Prime Minister made racially slurred remarks but also because he did so in a context which was full of potential to lead other people to feel that their livelihoods were being affected by a particular group of people, in this case the Jewish people. It was an irresponsible remark to make. It was an intolerant remark to make. For a head of state at the end of this century to make such a remark is unforgivable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must expect that it was premeditated. Certainly there has been no move by Dr Mahathir to withdraw the comments even under a hail of international condemnation. What concerns me is that there has been no response from the Australian government&mdash;certainly no response that is analogous to that which came from the United States. We must respond to that sort of comment because to not do so is to legitimise it and to allow worse comments to be made. It is important that when comments like that are made which are destructive of particular groups of people anywhere that the perpetrator be called to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be those who argue&mdash;and I have no doubt the government is amongst them&mdash;that we do not need to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Dr Mahathir was interfering in our affairs when he made that comment. He was damaging the Jewish community in this country when he made that comment. He was fostering racial division when he made that comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has to accept its responsibility and face up to that sort of racism and object to it. It is not good enough to argue that this could have some economic ramifications, that we may see some other contractual arrangements endangered by Dr Mahathir if he is confronted on racist statements like this. But that is no way for a government to behave. Ethics demand a strong repudiation of racist comments like those from Dr Mahathir when they are made. We cannot allow hypothetical considerations to do with economic interest to get in the way 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of standing up against such unwarranted and potentially destructive comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought it would be easy for the government to back this motion. On the face of it, it is a very restrained motion. It is simply asking that we send a message to Dr Mahathir calling on him to withdraw his comments&mdash;a very mild rebuke, indeed, a very mild course of action. If this government cannot at least reach that point of response to Dr Mahathir, they are failing the Australian feeling of a fair go&mdash;that we should stand up for minorities, that we should have the gumption to face up to bullies and that we cannot tolerate racist and racially dividing comments, not least those coming from heads of state. We should be keeping an eye, as I said, on the history of this century in ensuring that there is some government reaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it appalling that there has been silence from the government on this issue. It should not be left to a Green senator to move a motion like this in the Senate. It ought to have been a matter of instant government reaction, a responsibility that the government felt it had to at least respond to Dr Mahathir on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, instead of that, it appears as though the government is feeling very fragile, to say the least. It is willing to allow itself be bullied by this head of state. The tragedy of that is it is allowing a minority within our community as well as within communities elsewhere around to world to be not only bullied but inherently threatened by that sort of comment because it is hurtful, because it does upset people, because it does change their state of mind, their ambience of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we should pass this motion. Dr Mahathir should know that Australians do not easily accept intolerant racial slurs such as the one he has made. Who is to make that response? Of course it should be the government. If the government had done the right thing last week and made an immediate response, there would be no need for us to be considering this very mild rejoinder coming from the Greens on behalf of the Australian people who feel that Dr Mahathir should not get away with his racially loaded statement of last week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know that. How best should this issue be approached? It is the position of the government that the best way to approach an issue such as this is to unambiguously reaffirm the position that we hold on issues of racial intolerance, issues of anti-Semitism. That, I am pleased to say, was done by Senator MacGibbon in the motion that he moved a few moments ago that was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unanimously adopted by this place. The resolution of this place this day was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate reaffirms its often stated condemnation of anti&hyphen;semitism and all other forms of racial discrimination and, in particular, reaffirms its support for the joint parliamentary motion on racial tolerance, agreed to on 30 October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no ambiguity in that statement. Those who are interested in this issue and in where the Australian people might stand on the issue of racial discrimination need go no further than to take note of that unanimously adopted resolution; or, I say humbly, they need go no further than my answer to Senator Cooney of yesterday, which reaffirmed the government's position on this issue in very similar terms to those of the motion moved by Senator MacGibbon and adopted by the Senate this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, we think that when these occasions arise&mdash;and they do from time to time&mdash;often the best response is to reaffirm our commitment to a racially tolerant society. I would say, Senator Brown, not only reaffirm it&mdash;because words are often cheap&mdash;but perhaps each one of us should look at our actions and ensure that as individuals we take all possible actions to demonstrate in practical terms our abhorrence of racial intolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, even in this country we know that in times of economic stress, rapid structural change and tension, statements are made and individuals or races are sometimes blamed. Those statements are often made out of frustration or because of some other incapacity to address the issues. We find that, in relation to times of high unemployment, often it is the migrants who are blamed. It is those who are suffering in a situation of tension who are lashing out. It does not mean that they are necessary racially intolerant, but their words are hurtful, and when they are under stress they react by passing the blame to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure exactly what Dr Mahathir was seeking to do, but I did note that, contrary to what Senator Brown has said, following the early reports Dr Mahathir seemed to modify what had been said. I have taken a few print&hyphen;outs from the news reports as they have come off the computer. A report of 11 October, at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7854"> 21.22, reporting from Kuala Lumpur, stated that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that he did not accuse the Jews of undermining the economy of Malaysia and other Muslim countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the following day, 12 October, it was reported, again from Kuala Lumpur, that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad toned down an opinion he had previously voiced about a possible Jewish plot behind the country's recent currency turbulence. The report said: `"I did not attack the Jews", the leader said in remarks quoted in local newspapers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following day, some of his ministerial colleagues were saying similar things. On 13 October, the Malaysian tourism minister, in a response to it being put to him that Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying that Jews do not wish to see Muslim countries such as Malaysia succeed, Datuk Sabaruddin, said that this was not the case. He is reported as saying, `I do not think Dr Mahathir would say this'&mdash;that is, that the currency crisis is a result of the Jews&mdash;`I am sure he wouldn't blame the Jews. I don't think we are against Jews as a whole.' There was, in the circumstances leading up to these statements, an attempt to lash out at one individual, and I think that is what that last reference was to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem that, on reflection, Dr Mahathir very significantly toned down the remarks he made. That tends to confirm for me that to adopt this motion in its current terms, which is clearly designed by Senator Brown for what he sees as short&hyphen;term domestic political gain, is not going to be helpful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A much more responsible attitude would be to adopt a resolution in similar terms to that which Senator MacGibbon moved and the Senate as a whole adopted a few minutes ago. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit all words after "Senate", substitute "reaffirms its often stated condemnation of anti&hyphen;semitism and all other forms of racial discrimination and, in particular, reaffirms its support for the joint parliamentary motion on racial tolerance".</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had some discussion today on what happens under the difficulties associated with&mdash;and I quote the Leader of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill)&mdash;`economic stress and rapid structural change'. This has happened not only in Malaysia but simultaneously in a number of countries in South&hyphen;East Asia, some of which were considered to be the tiger economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also, in other forms, occurred in Australia. We know that the economic stress that has occurred, resulting in high and persistent levels of unemployment and rapid structural change, has resulted&mdash;within government, within bureaucracy and within some elements of industry&mdash;in frustration due to the inability to impact on this situation. Giving over the ability to take a number of different actions on the economy to the international World Trade Organisation has left a lot of people frustrated. So we can see a parallel in Malaysia with what has happened and is happening in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might well be difficult for this government to take firmer action in relation to the statements of Dr Mahathir because it may well make them very vulnerable to charges of a similar kind. As mentioned by Senator Hill&mdash;and I thank him for bringing out these points&mdash;in times of high unemployment, migrants are often blamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at those parallels in Australia. Migrants, refugees, Aboriginal people, young unemployed people and almost anyone on welfare have been blamed. How have they been blamed? They have been blamed by the actions of government. The government have specifically targeted those groups and fed on this particular very ripe opportunity for scapegoat politics in Australia. They have cut those programs. They have targeted groups for specific cuts, tried to close them down, tried to shut them up and basically continued to form a political attack on those groups because this is the right time to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the right time when, politically, Australia and other countries in the region are experiencing both economic stress in various ways and rapid structural change associated with the massive changes in international free trade. In Australia we can add to that the massive changes associated with the leap to competition policy. So you can see why the government would accept hosing down or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7855"> toning down of the statements that were made instead of taking a more ethical response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I indicate that I will be supporting the motion. I do not support the government generally going along with scapegoat politics, because that is what has happened. In my opinion, they have tried to cash in on scapegoat politics in Australia in many different ways. They are continuing to do that with the disgraceful response to the High Court's Wik decision. The government are culpable and they are vulnerable to counterclaims. In my opinion, that is why they are not taking a stronger position. Even if they are vulnerable, I support the stronger position, and I will not be supporting the amendment put forward by the government to this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) gets up and says that Dr Mahathir toned down his remarks. He did nothing of the sort. He said he did not say them. He said, `I didn't attack the Jews,' but he did. We are getting doubletalk here from the government on a matter that is very clear. Dr Mahathir made an abhorrent statement blaming the Jews for Malaysia's financial problems, in part or in whole, and indicating that this small group of people were to be singled out as responsible for a matter affecting all Malaysians. That is very racially loaded, damaging, dangerous, unacceptable stuff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government says, `Well, we'll move an amendment to the motion,' which removes all reference to Dr Mahathir himself. What game is the government playing here? Why can't they eyeball Dr Mahathir on this one? I suppose we get something of a clue from a comment made by Ian Sinclair in an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on 17 October, last Friday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . after all Paul Keating made remarks about Dr Mahathir being recalcitrant and look at the difficulties that created.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Dr Mahathir can say what he likes&mdash;very damaging, dangerous, racially slurring stuff&mdash;but we dare not respond because it may create some difficulties from Dr Mahathir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the wrong way for the government to go. The government should know that, if 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you do not stand up to comments like those that Dr Mahathir has made, you end up aiding and abetting the next lot. Silence is not just consent. There is no consent in this place to what Dr Mahathir said&mdash;his track record in these matters is pretty crook&mdash;but there is encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government should have the gumption to support this motion and call on Dr Mahathir to withdraw his remarks. The amendment that the government moved, which removes all reference to Dr Mahathir, is the amendment of an apologist. I ask the government to reconsider. It is not good enough; it is unacceptable; it is weak. It is letting down those people who are most hurt by the statements that Dr Mahathir made. I know Senator Hill has taken this up because he wants to score some political points. They are very demeaning remarks from Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These comments were made by Dr Mahathir almost a week ago. It would have been reasonable to expect a response from the Australian government. Instead of that, we have letters going to the nation's newspapers and people commenting in the streets. They are saying, `What is happening? What is the diversion that is big enough for the government to fail to make any response to these totally unacceptable statements by another head of state?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot help feeling that Ian Sinclair is exposing the government's timidity. The government does not want to have difficulties from Dr Mahathir. It is scared of responding to this man. This bully has got this government on the back foot. I say get that back foot forward, get on the front foot and stand up to this man. Stand up for the rights of those people affected by what he has said. Stand up against racial slurs&mdash;not least when they come from a head of state but particularly because they have come from a head of state of a country that we hold as being very valuable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very valuable relationship with Malaysia and the people of Malaysia in so many ways. But that does not excuse this head of state, who has had plenty of time to reflect on what he has said, for failing to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in relation to this motion because I was particularly saddened by the passing of Professor Whalan. I had known Doug for, I think, some 23 years. Doug actually taught me property law at the Australian National University back in 1975. He managed to get even me through property law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those opposite who may have a different view to me about native title may regret that Doug ever taught me property law. He was a very popular lecturer at ANU, and I certainly enjoyed the period I spent with him. He made what is otherwise a very dry subject one that I particularly enjoyed, and he made law school&mdash;and my law degree&mdash;a much more enjoyable experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was grateful to be able to renew my acquaintance with Doug when I joined the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7858"> Regulations and Ordinances Committee just after I came into the Senate in 1993. Joining the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was a sort of night watch for all the new boys and girls and I thought, `This is going to be a lot of fun, isn't it?' To my great pleasure and delight, Doug Whalan made it a most enjoyable committee. He taught me the importance of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. His unfailing sense of humour made each meeting of that committee a great pleasure and a great delight. It was terrific for me, as someone who had known him for that period of time, to renew that acquaintance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doug was a really delightful human being, a man whom it was a great pleasure and a privilege to know, an eminent lawyer and one who served in the position of legal adviser to that committee with enormous distinction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with an enormous amount of personal sadness and regret that I noted the death of Doug Whalan. I did not have the experience of Senator Minchin in having that perspective as a student, and I must say that I was very pleased to hear that perspective from Senator Minchin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had my first contact with Doug Whalan as chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee when I first came into this place. I recall only too well going to see a certain senior party figure when I came down here to nominate the committees that I wanted to be on. I actually wanted to be on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee because I had an interest in delegated legislation. I can recall saying that to the certain person who delegated these functions, and his response was, `Well, you won't have much competition for that.' Indeed, I ended up on the committee and I was delighted that I did. I was particularly interested to hear Senator Minchin's reference to the fact that Doug Whalan could make property law entertaining. He made regulations and ordinances entertaining, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of the thunder and lightning that obviously dominates the proceedings of this parliament, what is often overlooked here is the work of the committees and the public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service they perform. No committee of this parliament performs a more important and consistent public service than the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Its job is to oversee the personal rights of citizens and to ensure they are not infringed upon by the mass of delegated legislation which is now the order of the day in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of that committee can be very painstaking but the results, in terms of preserving people's rights, are extremely important. One only has to note the succession of notices of motions of disallowance that the chairman of the committee, Senator O'Chee, now brings into this place.</PARA>

There are two things that stick in my mind that I recall Doug Whalan discovering. In 1989, prior to the ACT becoming a self&hyphen;governing state, he discovered that a law still operated in the ACT requiring wine merchants to sell wine at reasonable prices. And I will never forget the regulation in the Telecommunications Act which Doug Whalan discovered actually made a legal offence out of telling a lie during a telephone conversation, which I am sure was not an intended consequence. It is with those concluding remarks that I commend the enormous public service that Doug Whalan gave through that committee. I deeply regret his passing.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never had the pleasure, privilege or perhaps burden of serving on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. But, at the time I mention, Doug Whalan was actually providing legal counsel to both the Regulations and Ordinances committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Very few people except those of us here would know what a monumental task that was. It was an extraordinary demand. Always and for ever Doug Whalan, as all of you have said&mdash;a person who brings a smile to my face just thinking of him&mdash;was civilised, interested and interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went to those committees as a person with a medical degree, not a legal degree. I was always delighted with the way Doug made non&hyphen;legally qualified people feel perfectly able to contribute. But, even more, he had a wonderful capacity to take seriously just about any proposal and comment put to him. It was as though he was in a state of perpetual learning. He was open to anything we said should be taken seriously, should be evaluated, but he was able to gently bring to one's attention an error in logic or the prospect of difficulty in how the matter might be concluded. He was never critical, he never put people down. He always invited people to open their minds and to express their ideas. He led brilliantly by his example in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an adviser to the aforementioned committee, and I thank Senator Cooney for mentioning that because I did not know whether I would be able to speak. I would also like to place on the record&mdash;I am sure she would not mind my doing this on her behalf&mdash;Senator Kay Patterson's sympathy. Senator Patterson equally participated in working closely with Doug Whalan.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A Breach of the Committee's Principles</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the terms of reference of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is to ensure that delegated legislation does not make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal. Administrative discretions have an immediate impact upon individuals and business firms and it is essential that these decisions made by Ministers and departmental bureaucrats should be subject to external review. Such review improves the quality of administration by concentrating the minds of decision makers on the fact that their actions are subject to review of their merits by an independent external body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every year the Committee raises with Ministers many instances where delegated legislation provides for administrative decisions with no apparent merits review provided for either in the enabling Act or in the legislative instrument itself. The Committee is gratified that it usually receives good cooperation from Ministers in this scrutiny. For instance, the last Annual Report of the Committee reported that Ministers had undertaken to amend one Act and 12 legislative instruments to provide for Administrative Appeals Tribunal review and to review the operations of another legislative instrument in the light of our concerns. The importance which the Committee attaches to external review of administrative decisions is illustrated by the same Report advising that the Committee had resolved formally to recommend disallowance of a regulation unless the Committee received on that day an undertaking to amend to provide for AAT review. The Committee then received such an undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the general high level of cooperation from Ministers it is disappointing for the Committee to have to report an instance where the Committee has not received a satisfactory response in respect of its concerns about external review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter, which has had a long gestation period, originated in the Committee's scrutiny of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Trade Practices Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.21</EMPHASIS> , which provided for fees payable for applications under the enabling Act for authorisation of agreements and covenants affecting competition, privacy and secondary boycotts, exclusive dealing conduct and mergers and for the notification of exclusive dealing conduct. The regulations also provided that the then Trade Practices Commission may decide that a concessional fee was payable in certain circumstances. Five of the fees were $7,500 reduced with a concession to $1,500 and one fee was $2,500 reduced with a concession to $500. There was no apparent AAT or other external review of this commercially valuable discretion and the Committee wrote to the Minister. In reply, the Assistant Treasurer advised the Committee that external review was inappropriate because the decision was a technical one, the Trade Practices Commission was the best body to determine those technical issues and the costs and delay of independent review would outweigh any benefit. This was not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7861"> a particularly satisfactory reply, because many technical decisions are subject to AAT or other independent external review. Indeed, technical decisions in many cases are particularly suited to review. Nevertheless the Committee accepted the advice but decided to include the matter in the Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President of the Administrative Review Council, quoting the Committee's Annual Report, then wrote to the Minister for Justice advising that, in the view of the ARC, the decisions relating to concessional fees should be subject to review. The Committee also wrote again to the Assistant Treasurer, referring to the ARC advice, asking that the regulations be amended to provide for external review. The Minister for Justice also wrote to the Assistant Treasurer suggesting merits review of the decisions by the Trade Practices Tribunal. The Assistant Treasurer replied to the Minister, with a copy to the Committee, advising that he did not favour merits review by either the AAT or the TPT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this time the 1996 Federal election had been held and the government had changed. Scrutiny of the regulations, however, continued. The Committee operates in a strictly non&hyphen;partisan way and addresses only personal rights and parliamentary propriety, avoiding policy issues. For these reasons its work continues despite changes in governments. In the present case there were also major changes to the enabling legislation, with the Trade Practices Commission becoming the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal replaced by the Australian Competition Tribunal. The Committee, however, continued to pursue the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee then wrote to the Attorney&hyphen;General, with copies to the Assistant Treasurer and the President of the ARC, noting that the ARC is a statutory agency with the function, among other things, of making recommendations to the Minister on review of administrative decisions, and asking for confirmation that the Attorney&hyphen;General accepted the present recommendation of the ARC. The Attorney&hyphen;General replied that he favoured review by the ACT. The Committee then wrote again to the Assistant Treasurer asking that the regulations be amended to provide for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Assistant Treasurer advised that, while he appreciated the importance of external merits review in improving the transparency and scrutiny of Commonwealth administrative decisions, merits review can increase the cost and complexity of regulation. These considerations need to be balanced against each other. The Assistant Treasurer further advised that in this case review would not be simple or trivial, with normally more than a week of hearings with decisions taking at least two months. Also, the right of review could provide an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunity for applicants to use the fee decision in order to challenge the ACCC view on market definition for strategic purposes unrelated to the application in question. Further, external review involves costs to the government as well as to the applicant and the total costs would be greater than the differential between the concessional fee and the full fee. Finally, preparing an amendment of the regulations would be time consuming and involve significant resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee then wrote to the Assistant Treasurer indicating that it was disappointed that he did not propose to amend the regulations. The Committee suggested that, given the unanimity of view between the Committee, the ARC and the Attorney&hyphen;General, there was a strong case to provide for review. The Assistant Treasurer replied that he could assure the Committee that he had taken careful account of its concerns but remained of the view that those particular decisions should not be subject to external merits review. The Assistant Treasurer further advised that, should circumstances change and a need for merits review arise, he would be happy to reconsider the matter. The Attorney&hyphen;General also wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, noting that the matters which he raised in opposition to external review were individually and cumulatively matters of significance. However, the Attorney&hyphen;General could not agree that these factors weighed heavily against external merits review. The Attorney&hyphen;General advised that similar agreements could be advanced for avoiding external review of many other administrative decisions, including ones of greater economic or political significance. The Attorney&hyphen;General advised that he regretted that the Assistant Treasurer had not accepted his advice on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter must now stand for the time being. It is, as I say, disappointing that the regulations cannot be amended and that the Committee must report to the Senate that the regulations are deficient in respect of independent external merits review. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that its concerns were endorsed by the President of the Administrative Review Council and by the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Committee is grateful for this. The Committee will continue to monitor any amendments of the principal Regulations with a view to correcting this breach of its principles.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Film and Sound Archive was established in 1984 and has as its charter the development, preservation and promotion of the national collection of recorded moving images and sound materials.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After inspecting the buildings housing the Archive at Acton, the Committee found that the main historic headquarters building is suitable for the public functions of the Archive but is inadequate for its administrative and specialist technical functions. Existing deficiencies are:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the construction of demountable buildings has substantially compromised the site's heritage significance and is not consistent with the intentions of the National Capital Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After inspecting the specialist technical facilities in the basement and registration and accession areas housed in demountable buildings, the Committee came away with a strong perception that the Archive is indeed served by a dedicated staff. The staff have displayed stoic forbearance in very difficult working conditions. It was obvious that the major concern of staff has been to keep the facilities operating despite potential safety risks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the Archive's administrative and technical accommodation is of very low quality, functionally unsuitable, inefficient and does not comply with current fire safety and occupational health and safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After examining a range of options which would overcome these problems, the Committee concluded that the construction of a new administrative and technical support building contiguous with the existing Headquarters building at Acton would be the least expensive and more practical solution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major element of the proposal examined by the Committee will involve the construction of a new two storey building of 4230 square metres along the north&hyphen;west of the existing Headquarters building

These acts are the Defence Act 1903, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Judges Pensions Act 1968, and the Governor&hyphen;General Act 1974.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will ensure that the superannuation contributions surcharge, which is designed to make superannuation arrangements more equitable by addressing the concessional tax treatment for superannuation contributions in respect of high income earners, applies to people entitled to superannuation benefits under the acts to be amended by the bill. However, serving federal Judges are constitutionally protected from the application of the surcharge.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schemes under the acts to be amended by the bill are either unfunded or largely unfunded defined benefits schemes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in relation to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997. Like so many of the government's bills, this bill is an amalgamation of some parts which are beneficial to the community, and other parts which are quite harsh and which the opposition does not support. I want to say at the outset that, despite our reservations about some components of the bill, we do not seek either to amend or to oppose the bill. However, I will be moving a second reading amendment which outlines some of our concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That second reading amendment is being circulated at this time. I want to make it clear that the reason the opposition is not opposing this bill is not that we support all aspects of it but that we would not like to see the beneficial aspects of the bill for our veterans deferred for some considerable amount of time while amendments are debated. So we will be allowing the bill passage today in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The bill has three major elements: the first element relates to the clarification of the advance payment of veterans' pensions; the second element deals with the Commonwealth's liability being extinguished for the medical consequences of smoking by veterans in the future; and the third element deals with changes to repatriation benefits and a clarification of defence declarations. The opposition supports the first two elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first element relating to advance payments stems from the 1995 legislation&mdash;passed when Labor was in government&mdash;that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allows pensioners of modest means to have advance payments on their pension of up to $500, or 13 times the person's fortnightly rate. This amount must be repaid within six months. These payments can be used for things such as home repairs or equipment and travel where their fortnightly pension cannot meet these expenses. It allows veterans some flexibility with their income and expenditure. This measure is now being liberalised to also allow disability pensioners and war widows to have access to these payments. This further extension of the previous Labor government's initiative is, of course, supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the second element relates to the extinguishment of the Commonwealth's liability for the medical consequences of future smoking. As of 31 December this year, the taking up of smoking in the future or an increase in smoking will not be compensatable by the Commonwealth. Of course, this will only apply where illnesses relate to that tobacco use, and not through some other cause. It will not affect veterans who acquired a service&hyphen;related smoking habit before 1 January 1998. So if a veteran took up smoking as a result of their war service, continued to smoke and, as a result, developed some sort of disease, they are still covered despite this amendment. The opposition thinks that this date is reasonable and will be supporting this portion of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have difficulty with the third element of the bill because we believe that it is inequitable and is quite harsh in relation to some members of our veterans community. The 1996 election platform of this government promised to review all overseas service anomalies in respect of both medals and repatriation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A joint Department of Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence review was established and changes to repatriation were announced in the 1997 budget. There were no community representatives on this review committee and there was no public consultation. That is unfortunate, because some of the oversights possibly may not have occurred if in fact there had been community input, in particular from the veterans community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7867">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report produced by this joint committee was never released to the public. It seems to me quite contrary to general principles of open government that seem to be accepted not only by the opposition but also, for the most part, by the government and minority parties. In this day and age, I would have thought that that was quite a normal procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence considered or the method used by the committee to draw its conclusions have never been released either.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TAMBLING" NAMEID="6E4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the actual conclusions that were reached by the committee were tabled but not the complete report, including the reasoning behind those conclusions, which is quite a different thing. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, has even gone so far as to refuse to allow an overall departmental briefing. Again, in relation to principles of open government that most members of the Australian parliament would support, that is quite unfortunate. All of this is in contrast to the former Labor government's Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence&hyphen;related Awards. For that inquiry, community members with service experience were consulted, there was consultation with ex&hyphen;service organisations and the full report was published and made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that the government has been inconsistent in its treatment of anomalies. Even though some changes are welcomed, there are other anomalies that this bill fails to pick up. The opposition welcomes the extension of service pension entitlements to some categories, primarily to the United Nations peacekeeping categories and to embassy guards and evacuation personnel who remained in Vietnam after January 1973. The opposition also welcomes the extension of recognition for operational service to a number of areas, including the Far East Strategic Reserve and RAAF servicemen in Thailand. While we recognise these extensions, they do not cover all the anomalies. Specifically, the qualifying service status for RAAF personnel who served in Ubon, Thailand from June 1965 to August 1968 should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be further extended, and there should also be a further extension for those who served on RAN ships in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of concern set out in our second reading amendment is that qualifying service status should be extended to personnel who served at RAAF Ubon in Thailand between those two dates that I mentioned. We believe the fact that this bill has not dealt with that issue is a major oversight. The government argues that RAAF personnel who served in Thailand from 1962 until 1968 pursuant to Australia's South&hyphen;East Asia Treaty Organisation obligations were there merely to guard Thai airspace, and that their activities were entirely separate from Australia's Vietnam involvement. On 13 February, Mrs Bishop said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a RAAF contingent based at Ubon in Thailand on the borders of Laos and Cambodia between 1962 and 1968. They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">RAAF personnel despatched to Ubon in May 1962 were involved in Australia's first bilateral military engagement in the region with the United States. This was an important strategic location 50 kilometres from the Laos border, 80 kilometres from the Cambodian border, 200 kilometres from the Ho Chi Minh trail and close to the Mekong River. Until 1965 the personnel at Ubon were basically engaged in a schedule of routine training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not accept that personnel at Ubon were not engaged in activities worthy of qualifying service from June 1965 until August 1968. The reasons for this are: following apparent Chinese air assistance to North Vietnam, the United States decided in 1965 to escalate operations at Ubon. A fully integrated Royal Thai Air Force and United States Air Force defence system was established under effective US control. RAAF personnel No. 79 Squadron came under effective control of the US 2nd Air Division Task Operations Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Air Defence: Thailand Involving the Royal Australian Air Force No. 79 Squadron</EMPHASIS> outlined new rules of engage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7868"> ment. I will quote them, at the risk of consuming too much of my time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applicability: Applies to all RTAF units and all other units, including the RAAF, responsive to CINCRTAF for Air Defence of Thailand . . . An aircraft commits a hostile act when it conducts unauthorised aerial reconnaissance or combat tactics within the national boundary of Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rules of engagement operated under from June 1965 were warlike in nature and were not restricted to acting in self&hyphen;defence. RAAF personnel in Ubon performed similar tasks to those RAAF personnel in Vietnam. No allied air bases occurred in either Ubon or Vietnam. Statutory declarations by RAAF officers who served there confirm extensive enemy activity directed at Ubon which entailed danger to Australian personnel. These include a Thai helicopter shot down in May 1967 and a USAF C130 being hit by ground fire in its approach to land. There are various other examples that show that this was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve should also be covered. Again, there are three arguments that justify their inclusion. RAN personnel were allegedly never allotted&mdash;and we know the continuous debate about allotment&mdash;to duty. They were not subject to military law. They did not incur additional operational risk. This is the argument put by the government. With the budget announcement granting them access to a disability pension, the coalition has abandoned the first two arguments because, of course, to receive that pension you must have been allotted. The government maintains the argument that they did not incur sufficient additional operational risk to justify the service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operations that RAN personnel assumed in Malaya were clearly beyond peacetime demands. The primary role as is laid down in the general directive was to secure and defend the sea lanes and coastline of Malaya. The secondary role was to participate in operations against communist forces. Actual operations included escorting troops through the harbour, which was allegedly mined, enforcing a blockade of enemy positions, preventing infiltration by the enemy, bombardment of communist positions, general supportive functions for other Australian and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth personnel, and protection of merchant shipping. It seems to me that these activities being considered are conduct worthy of appropriate recognition of access to service pensions. I must say that I am not convinced by the arguments put by the government on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter that we have raised in our second reading amendment requests that the government restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistical support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam. I was very glad to hear that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Scott, announced this measure in question time today. I have to say that I applaud the government for this measure. There are a lot of members of the veteran community who would be very grateful for that extension. I think it is a shame that the government took so long to recognise the logical error in their refusal to include that. Bearing that in mind, I will not go into that issue at any further length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second part of our amendment, I would like to read a letter I have received from the RAAF Ubon Reunion&hyphen;Recognition Group which I believe is quite important in expressing the views of veterans who did serve in the conflict there. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent statements made by Cheryl Kernot, concerning the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"uncaring attitude of your government"</EMPHASIS>  that have so moved her, ring true for our group also. Despite unequivocal and irrefutable evidence, presented to your Minister Bishop (and other members of your government) <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">our group is still denied</EMPHASIS>  our rightful active service recognition regarding our service at Ubon particularly, from 1965 onward. And, this despite <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">total support</EMPHASIS>  for our cause from the Opposition and from various veterans groups including the RSL of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our group is only around 1500 strong. However, our people are spread far and wide across this land throughout many electorates and we have the support of many other veteran groups ie support from many people in many electorates.</PARA>

Moreover, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7869"> will approach the RSL to outline our case in the "RSL News" magazine, including a highlighting of the hurdles unfairly placed in our recognition path by your government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not quote that letter in order to threaten you&mdash;and I suppose it will not frighten you. But I raise it to show you how strongly that particular group of people feel about this issue, how unfair and inequitable I think it is for them and how little it would cost this government to give those people the recognition I believe they so rightly deserve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill</XREF> . The bill extends eligibility for compensation and the service pension to a number of veterans who did not previously qualify for these benefits. It extinguishes Commonwealth liability for the medical consequences of future smoking and it clarifies Defence declarations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reintroduces a couple of very welcome initiatives which were contained in a previous veterans bill, which we first looked at earlier this year, including the establishment of a veterans vocational rehabilitation program to assist veterans who are re-entering the civilian work force. The Democrats strongly support extending compensation entitlements to those veterans who are listed in this bill and we strongly support the recognition that service in Vietnam between 12 January 1973 and 29 April 1975 was, in fact, war&hyphen;like service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that the changes to compensation for smoking in this bill are positive and that they reflect the much deeper understanding we now have on the dangers of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> smoking. I hope that these changes to compensation for smoking will dissuade veterans who do not currently smoke from taking it up and dissuade those veterans who do currently smoke from increasing their level of smoking. I probably should declare a kind of vested interest. My uncle, who is a veteran of the Second World War, may be seeking compensation because he was advised by service doctors to take up smoking while he was serving&mdash;to calm his nerves, apparently. We have come a long way since those days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would like to make a few comments with regard to several changes which were not contained in this bill in its original form but which have been included as a result of government amendments in the House of Representatives. Once again, the Democrats welcome the substance of these changes. In particular, we welcome the establishment of the veterans vocational rehabilitation program. However, we do not welcome the government's claims that the Democrats played some kind of a role in delaying the implementation of these changes. In fact, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) made some pretty cheap shots in the House of Representatives which he knew were not true, I guess because there was no&hyphen;one there to put the contrary point of view, although I imagine the opposition did that in their own case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make clear to the Senate today that any blame for a delay in relation to the implementation of these measures must rest firmly on the government's shoulders. The government stands condemned for trying to shift the blame for the lateness of the adoption of these changes onto the shoulders of the Democrats and the opposition. This government needs to be condemned for the comments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the House of Representatives. His comments that these measures have been delayed because of `an unholy alliance' between the Democrats and the opposition are nothing short of an untruth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The piece of legislation in which this government previously tried to introduce these very positive and welcome changes also contained some very harsh measures which, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7870"> if accepted, would have hurt the very veterans this government claims to be so concerned about. One of the harshest of these measures was the inclusion in income and assets tests for the service pension of the superannuation assets held by veterans. If the Senate had passed this measure, veterans would have been forced to run down their superannuation before being eligible for the service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, with the opposition, opposed these measures because we believe that the superannuation assets should be exempt to protect the nest eggs of the many people who have worked hard and sacrificed income to provide for their retirement. It is unfair for the government to encourage people into superannuation and then penalise them for following that advice, and this move threatened public confidence and support for Australia's superannuation system&mdash;confidence and support on which our `super' system relies. The Democrats voted against these harsh measures because, unlike the government, we care about veterans. Because we care about veterans we also urged the government to separate the measures contained in this previous bill so that we could pass the rest of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government then held veterans to ransom by refusing to pass the good parts of the previous bill, despite our  urging them to do so, unless the Senate agreed to pass the harsh parts as well. I regard this as blackmail and the Democrats condemn the government for using Australia's veterans as a lever to push very harsh measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now I would like to turn to the opposition amendments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats will be supporting the opposition amendments today because we believe the government has failed the veterans in the areas to which these amendments relate. The first part of the opposition's amendment deals with this government's very poor performance and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service. I would particularly like to draw the Senate's attention to the appalling way this government has handled the whole area of medalling, that is, the awarding of medals. Minister Bishop's bungling over the awarding of double medals, with the on again/off again saga of medals for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of Australia's veterans, is one that deserves a special mention for the great deal of anguish, pain and distress it caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will also be supporting the second part of the opposition's amendment. We are happy to support part 2 of this amendment because we believe there is a very strong case for extending service status to personnel at RAAF Ubon, Thailand from June 1965 to August 1968 and to RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency. After many discussions and ongoing correspondence with veterans who served in both these forces I accept that these men have been unjustly dealt with when it comes to eligibility for the benefits. We must never forget the incredible sacrifice these men made for us and for future generations of Australians. For this reason I would urge the government to reconsider the case of these two groups of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Neal pointed out, today in the House of Representatives the government did take up part of the original amendments that the opposition were moving, and we are grateful for that. That was to do, of course, with entitlements to Vietnam naval logistic support personnel for the journey to and from Australia. We are grateful the government is doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other issue I would like to raise. Perhaps I will seek an answer to this from the minister. I am sure his advisers are listening. In the schedule of service which is now to be regarded as operational service is the issue of the Commonwealth occupation forces in Japan. I have a question about the date mentioned. I was inclined to move an amendment to alter the date, but I would be happy to receive an explanation about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dates given in the schedule are 3 January 1949 to 30 June 1951 inclusive. I am sure the government has a reason for that, but it is not clear to me. I understand that Australian servicemen served in Japan from 1946 onwards not from 1949 onwards. It seems to me that there is every reason to extend this provision to all Australian servicemen who served in Japan during that period and I am not clear why it should not be 1946&mdash;and I do not have the month&mdash;to 1951. I would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7871"> appreciate an explanation from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I say that it is important that we never forget that the expense of war does not cease with the end of hostilities. Even after peace is restored, the cost of war is still high in the lives of Australia's veterans and their families. For this reason, the Democrats do not support any policy which fails to acknowledge a special obligation to veterans or which does not recognise their special needs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . I want to talk particularly about a case that came to light which supports the opposition's resolution about the Ubon contingent. An article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Advocate</EMPHASIS> , the Bathurst paper, on 1 October which had the story of a now civilian but former RAAF member, Joe Richards, and his time at Ubon. It is very illuminating to hear his description of what took place there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was there for six months to December 1966 working as a rescue fireman alongside US service personnel in the rescue section. Starting in 1962 they were officially charged with maintenance and with working around the air force base and classified as a peacekeeping force. It is pretty obvious from Mr Richards's comments that this was more than a peacekeeping force. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were on duty 24 hours on and 24 hours off for six months solid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were 300 Australians on one side of a landing strip with 3000 Americans on the other side. A full strike base, 24 hours a day, flying operations into Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were part of the Vietnam War. There were planes coming in to the base all shot&hyphen;up. We were there for any emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several times we were on alert. Communis</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ts fired on planes, they were either Thai&hyphen;Cong or Pathet&hyphen;Lao.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This gentleman is upset because, after six years in the RAAF, he has been unable to obtain a home loan from defence services. It is pretty clear from this gentleman's story that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this was more than just a peacekeeping force. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australian servicemen were passed off by Government and authorities as peace keepers at a time US Congress also claimed they had no bases in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the propaganda of the time. Mr Richards knows&mdash;from the declassification of documents in the US in August of this year&mdash;that the details of this were revealed and that it was seen as service. He is one of a group of 1,000 or more RAAF personnel who spent time at Ubon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a RAAF officer who lost his life when his Sabre jet crashed at Ubon and, according to some of the statutory declarations which Senator Neal referred to, the cause was not established&mdash;although insurgent action cannot be discounted. That was part of a statutory declaration made by Frederick Knudsen, RAAF Officer Commanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that there were many false alerts, sometimes caused by meteorological phenomena which showed up on US radar, and other incidences where mysterious aircraft were detected. There are statutory declarations stating that an enemy MiG21, which identified and chased two RAAF Sabres from Ubon, was shot down by a missile from a US Air Force Phantom in January 1967. Unmarked C123s were identified on 1 December 1965. Two Sabres scrambled and shadowed a Beechcraft twin turboprop aircraft, which then turned back over the Laotian border on 21 October 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hot scrambles were made to search for suspected IL28 bombers on 7 February 1968 and on several occasions during April and May of 1968. We know that there were further alerts after the Australian troops pulled out. Three further confirmed insurgency ground attacks were reported. As I said, there was the loss of one pilot officer L. J. McGrath, who was killed in a crash close to Ubon on 3 January 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems very strange that you have this type of activity taking place. You also now have the release of the US documents which indicate and acknowledge that they did have an air force base at Ubon, 50 kilometres inside the Thai border. According to Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7872"> Richards, who was there at the time, they ran 24&hyphen;hour operations into Vietnam or Laos. In his own words, it was a full on thing. It was not just keeping the peace. They were said to be peacekeepers, but they were on 24-hour on, 24&hyphen;hour off, shifts. It is vitally important that this be taken into consideration and that the work these people did be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it might not have been intense pressure that they were under, they were there under the threat of being fired upon, of having active military, warlike actions taken against them. They were not to know whether the alerts or alarms were false or the real thing because there was enough of the real thing happening for them to be concerned that it could well have been live ammunition they were facing and it could have been unfriendly fire. This must have had some effect upon these gentlemen and certainly caused them stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vitally important that the opposition's motion be passed. It would be recognition of the work that these people did from 1965 to 1968. To say that it is not granted qualifying service status is to them very offensive, particularly as they know that they were under fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The naval personnel involved in the Malaysian emergency between 1955 and 1960 are seeking to be recognised. One of the reasons given for not having any recognition is that the enemy did not have a navy. The enemy also did not have an air force, but the RAAF personnel were given recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The naval personnel had to make sorties into areas where mines may have been laid. They were there to enforce a blockade of enemy positions. They would track and intercept enemy signals. They prevented enemy infiltration. They bombarded communist positions. They provided general support for land forces, including escorting troops through the mined harbour. To say that this was not somewhat dangerous is to ignore the obvious facts of the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were also apparently exposed to danger when they were on shore leave. They were certainly fired upon when they were in harbour. During the 1957 race riot, sailors were exposed to danger while onshore, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shots are reported to have been fired at some while they were in Singapore. So it remains a bit puzzling to me as to why there has been a line drawn in the sand. This is not a large number of people but a significant number of people who have been prepared to go, fight and stand up in the face of enemy fire for what they believe in, but they are being denied this recognition that they deservedly seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vitally important that the government do what they have done already with the Vietnam naval logistical personnel entitlements. They have actually reviewed and today announced that they are prepared to grant them entitlements. Why not the rest of them? These are people who, the cream of their youth, went and worked hard and fought hard. In real terms, they were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice if they had to, as certainly one of the RAAF personnel did near Ubon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It behoves the government to very seriously think about this and to review this matter. The former personnel are not happy. They feel they have been neglected. They feel their contribution has not been recognised. They feel that the value of the work they did and their worth is not being considered to be the same as others who were in areas where there is no contention as to what they in fact served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ill behoves the government to be so miserly and to not care what happened to this group of people who at the time would have worked under stress. If you are on a 24-hour shift and have to remain alert, to conduct sorties, to maintain perimeter guards and to be ready for any emergency that might come, you are living under stress and strain. Even if they might not have seen a great deal of active fire, they would have obviously been in areas where munitions were being handled, where bombs were being handled, where planes were being loaded and, presumably, where planes were coming back that were damaged and had not been able to discharge their load. So these people were placed in danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would well behove the government to go and look at the documentation that has been released now by the US department and just 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7873"> check and recognise that the US government, the US military, were running sorties from the Ubon air base into Laos and Cambodia at that time. It is incumbent upon the government to be cognisant of that, to recognise that, and to give these people the entitlements which they are due.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to sum up on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . From the comments made initially by Senator Neal, there would appear to be some confusion between her and the Labor spokesmen in the House of Representatives, Mr Ferguson. I am concerned that, in the intervening period of time between when the bill was introduced in that place and here, they have not been able to get a consistent view or consistent opinion in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report which was referred to entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of service anomalies</EMPHASIS> was tabled on 25 September 1997 by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott, in the House during the summing&hyphen;up of the bill. That report looked at 15 anomalies and recommended 12 separate anomalies that have resulted in an extension of the benefits to 10,500 veterans. Contrary to what Senator Neal seemed to imply, Labor has not asked the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a full departmental briefing. We would be happy to oblige.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is good news for the veteran community, and its passage is eagerly awaited. The veteran community is concerned that amendments have been moved in the Senate. I hope the opposition realises that it is causing distress to over 20,000 veterans who will be directly affected by any further delay to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will address the amendments directly, and perhaps in reverse order to that put forward in the Labor motion. Firstly, it is a bit late for the opposition to claim now that Royal Australian Navy personnel who served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency should be granted qualifying service for the granting of a service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Far East Strategic Reserve Act 1956 was repealed by the Veterans' Entitlement Act 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1986. If Labor had wanted to address the concerns of naval personnel who served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency, it has had plenty of chances. Even when Labor went to the extent of amending the VEA in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1995, it never bothered to address those concerns. Not only did Labor continue the exclusion for qualifying service for members of the Far East Strategic Reserve, but it also continued the exclusion of operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We intend to extend operational service status to members of the FESR through this bill. The naval association has raised its objections over this matter with the government, and this matter is being looked at. If any individual members of the Far East Strategic Reserve can prove that they incurred danger from the enemy, then their case can be considered. Subject to meeting the same requirements that the army and air force veterans have to meet, they would then be eligible for full repatriation benefits and they would qualify for a service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the service of the Royal Australian Air Force at the Ubon Air Base in Thailand, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs thanks the RAAF Ubon Recognition Group for its submission. Minister Scott has written to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), asking for the new evidence presented by the RAAF Ubon Recognition Group to be examined and dealt with by the procedures established by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operational service will apply to all members of the Royal Australian Air Force who served at Ubon. This will entitle them to apply for disability pensions to cover any injuries they sustained during their service at Ubon. Similarly, if individual members believe they incurred danger from the enemy, they should apply to Veterans' Affairs with their evidence. The gate is always open for any member of the RAAF to put his case forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information that both Senator West and Senator Neal referred to has been received by Minister Scott and has been passed to Minister Bishop for examination. It will be handled in accordance with the arrangements 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7874"> that they have made with the Prime Minister. Mrs Bishop will examine it and make recommendations to the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process has been shown to be a quick, equitable and comprehensive mechanism for examining any service anomalies. In line with the government's commitment to examine any new anomalies brought to the attention of the government, I am pleased to inform the Senate that the issue of port&hyphen;to&hyphen;port coverage for Vietnam navy logistics support personnel has been resolved by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue was first brought to the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 6 August 1997. The anomaly has now been resolved. As Senator Neal referred to in her speech, this announcement was made earlier today. I refer in particular to the media release by Bruce Scott MP, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, dated today and entitled `Government removes anomaly for Vietnam navy logistics support port&hyphen;to&hyphen;port eligibility'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That press release sets out the details and the extensions that this means to 10,000 Vietnam veterans who now have access to the disability pension and health care for conditions acquired at any stage during their journey to and from the operational area. I also refer to the fact that this fixes a problem originally created by Labor in 1986, with an instrument signed by the then defence minister, Kim Beazley, denying navy logistics support personnel eligibility for port&hyphen;to&hyphen;port coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No legislation is needed to correct this anomaly. A retrospective instrument of deemed allotment will provide port&hyphen;to&hyphen;port coverage to these naval veterans. This proves two points: firstly, this government has a genuine commitment to rectify several anomalies; and, secondly, the process of review works. No such speedy mechanism existed during the 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to the issue raised by Senator Woodley on the matter of compensation coverage of Australian BCOF personnel in Japan. I am disappointed that Senator Woodley did not acknowledge the fact that officers of the government had faxed an information sheet on this matter to both his Brisbane and Canberra offices yesterday for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his attention. That matter was not addressed in the comments that he made. If he would like a further copy of that advice, I have one here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other important measures in this bill. The first is the opportunity to allow aged pensioners who also receive a disability pension to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans and their eligible partners, it will mean that they need to deal with only one department. Over 10,000 veterans have already indicated that they wish to have their pensions paid by Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second measure is the establishment of a vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans. This government undertook to monitor closely the long&hyphen;term care needs of Vietnam veterans. This measure has been long awaited by the Vietnam veteran community and would now be in place if the Democrats had not unfairly amended the 1996 Veterans' Affairs Budget Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will be available to all eligible veterans. The legislation presented guarantees that those veterans who volunteer to take part in a rehabilitation program under the scheme will not have their pensions reduced while participating in that program and will receive at least the same income had they not participated in the rehabilitation program and entered employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to expanding and improving benefits to the veterans' community. These measures are not merely a reward for those who serve this country in war. They are benefits veterans have earned by their sacrifices.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would have thought that, if we had moved that as a request in the committee stage, it would be far more telling than to have it as a second reading amendment. Nevertheless, what I propose to do is to vote against the amendment as it stands and move a further amendment which encompasses part (b) of the opposition's amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the specific question asked by Senator Woodley with regard to the coverage of Australian BCOF personnel in Japan, I referred to the facts that had been made available to his office yesterday and to which he has now referred. Given the brevity of the briefing note, it might be best if I just read it, because it then goes into the record, and add to it. The briefing note actually reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No service in BCOF has ever been covered under repatriation legislation after 30 June 1951. The significance of this date is that it is the last possible day on which anyone could render service in connection with World War II. This is set out in section 72 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anomaly being addressed in the bill is that at times prior to 30 June 1951 Australian defence personnel in the BCOF were covered under different compensation provisions while performing the same duties in the same places at the same times in Japan. This differing compensation coverage arose from the different terms of enlistment. Early enlistments during or approximate to World War II continue to receive the more generous coverage under the Repatriation Act or Interim Forces Benefits Act while later enlistments or re&hyphen;enlistments in the permanent forces had the standard Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a generous solution to even up compensation coverage. It is not feasible to now remove earlier generosity as a solution to anomalies. No ex-service organisation has approached the department since the budget announcement to amend or challenge the appropriateness of the 30 June 1951 end date, which has now stood for five and a half decades. There is no suggestion that BCOF personnel in Japan after 30 June 1951 experienced any conditions that warranted compen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sation coverage other than that provided under the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in the bill mean that ADF personnel performing the same duties in the same places at the same times are covered under the same compensation arrangements. Former members of BCOF who remained in Japan after they were transferred to British Commonwealth Forces Korea have separate eligibility or entitlements under the VEA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Woodley also asked a question with regard to service before 1949. I am advised that this is already covered under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as being included in World War II service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Mackay to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> and the comments she made. I think if we hark back to the committee stage of the Workplace Relations Bill 1996 a lot of disquiet was expressed about the operation of Australian workplace agreements and, consequently, about the role that the Employment Advocate would have in relation to those agreements. The second reading amendment clearly deplores the government's attempts to give the Employment Advocate more powers and to undermine the rights of employees under the existing act and under the guise of so-called technical amendments, as it reads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7877">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from Senator Mackay about the problems that members of the opposition have had in estimates hearings in exploring the operation of the Employment Advocate and the decisions taken, as funded by the government, in relation to the operation of that legislation. I think it is fair to say that nothing which has occurred to date in relation to the operation of the Workplace Relations Bill 1996 has gainsaid the concerns that the opposition expressed about that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recently seen the minister responsible for that bill and for this bill, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), given another responsibility&mdash;that is, a responsibility for waterfront reform. His department, the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business, appears to be taking responsibility for that part of the transport portfolio which relates to the waterfront. That is a very interesting proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That change demonstrates that this government's policy in relation to the waterfront is now restricted to attacking the Maritime Union. That is clearly the message that this government, by giving responsibility of waterfront reform to the industrial relations minister, a very controversial minister with very controversial legislation, has given to the Australian people. The government has no interest in waterfront reform other than attacking the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill</XREF>  makes a series of amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 in relation to areas such as certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements, the Employment Advocate, the no&hyphen;disadvantage test, termination of employment, freedom of association and union disamalgamation. I will not be making detailed comments on all of these issues in my second reading contribution, but I would like to express my concern at the general trend to amend this already flawed legislation by tipping the scales even further in favour of employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Western Australia we have seen the various waves of so-called reform being pushed through the state parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment by Minister Kierath, including the most recent farce when the government went to extreme lengths to pass its legislation before the new legislative councillors took their seats and the government lost control of the Legislative Council for the first time in 100 years. I suspect that this bill is just the first of a series of federal waves which will continue to erode the beachhead of already eroded worker protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changing rules applying to the role and powers of the Employment Advocate are one aspect that is of great concern. I strongly opposed the creation of this position in the 1996 bill because I felt it was designed more as an Employer Advocate and I have not changed my position. I believe that those in Western Australia who have already been affected will certainly justify that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments before us in this bill in large part add to my concerns and certainly do not provide any of the protections for workers generally or special categories of workers such as migrant women, the disabled, or young people that I attempted to have inserted during the committee stage of the Workplace Relations Bill in late 1996. What the government fails to acknowledge in this bill and in the Workplace Relations Act itself is that there is a massive difference in the relative negotiating power of employers and employees, particularly as we move into Minister Reith's brand new world of individual, take&hyphen;it&hyphen;or&hyphen;leave&hyphen;it, contract negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the Senate of some comments that I made in this place on 30 September 1997 in relation to a ministerial statement by Minister Reith on the topic of small business. In that statement, he acknowledged the fact that I agree with him that small business operators were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. Accordingly, the minister was announcing that he would introduce amendments to the Trade Practices Act that would give protection to small business in its commercial dealings with big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud that move, but I have to wonder why the minister&mdash;who, of course, also has responsibility for industrial relations&mdash;does not also consider the need for protection of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7878"> employees in their contract negotiations with employers. We know that it is a take it or leave it system that the government is enforcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave any detailed comments to the committee stage of the bill, but I will indicate here that I will oppose many of the clauses in the bill. I will most likely oppose the bill in its entirety, given the likely outcome of the voting on the amendments before us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  points out that the amendments are technical. The first full paragraph says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR Act) and other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Although the bill carries out some technical amendments, there is a great importance attached in the second reading speech to those technical amendments. The first page of the second reading speech also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope for our reforms to continue to bring about the productivity improvements which are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth will be further enhanced by the technical amendments proposed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Speeches, of course, are limited, but there is nothing in the second reading speech that goes to support that proposition. No doubt, when we come to the committee stages, some questions will be asked about evidence and evidence will be forthcoming. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Troeth) is now at the table in charge of the bill. I would like to acknowledge Senator Troeth's presence and congratulate her on her appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts has said, the big issue is whether the philosophy underlying the Workplace Relations Act is the proper philosophy to carry this nation forward so that it improves economically, socially, culturally and in every other way. As has been said again and again in debate in this chamber, there is considerable argument and considerable doubt as to whether the system of individual contracts will be able to underpin a better social, economic and cultural life in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. There is considerable doubt about that for a variety of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, people who come to bargain as individuals&mdash;with an individual employer on one side and an individual employee on the other side&mdash;usually find themselves at a disadvantage, and that disadvantage is usually on the employee's side. An equality of bargaining position makes for a better workplace and makes for a better culture in which to go forward as a country. It is for that reason that this legislation is to be debated&mdash;as it has been in this chamber&mdash;from the point of view that this idea of individualism is not a good idea. Civic leaders, church leaders and other prominent leaders have talked about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oftentimes there is great criticism made of the union movement and the work force. It is worth while understanding that that has been a criticism that has been going on for a long time&mdash;for centuries. It is good to know that people have seen the falsehood of anti&hyphen;union movements and have seen the falsehood of condemnations of people in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one person whom I would like to quote who saw that is the wartime Prime Minister in England, Sir Winston Churchill. It is worth while quoting from a speech of his about production on 29 July 1941, when England, of course, was at its most vulnerable. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are told how badly labour is behaving, and then a lot of people who never did a day's hard work in their lives are out after them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sir Winston was saying then&mdash;and it is apposite for today&mdash;that a lot of criticism is made of the work force. A lot of criticism is made of how Australians go about their industry and that criticism has often come from people who, as Sir Winston says, `Never did a hard day's work in their lives.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he had to say about a trade union leader is also interesting. Sir Winston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the fashion nowadays to abuse the Minister of Labour. He is a workman, a trade union leader. He is taunted with being an unskilled labourer representing an unskilled union. I daresay he gives offence in some quarters; he has his own methods of speech and action. He has a frightful load to carry; he has a job to do which none would envy. He makes mistakes, like I do, though not so many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7879"> or so serious&mdash;he has not got the same opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In one last quote from the great man, Sir Winston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I daresay that some of our critics will not like this kind of talk. They call it complacency. Living in comparative idleness, they wish to lash the toilers of body and mind to further exertions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McGauran illustrates exactly what Sir Winston was talking about. Senator McGauran says, `What about the waterfront?' Senator McGauran, you are a man of decency, and the problem is what people like you think about the waterfront. I must confess that we have got to say about you what Sir Winston said: living in comparative idleness, you wish to lash the toilers of body and mind to further exertion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doubt you congratulate him on his very illustrious career in the union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech makes the point that the fundamental objective of the act is for the parties to reach agreement without arbitration. If agreements can be reached fairly, if agreements can be reached so that everybody feels that they have had a reasonable deal from the agreement that underpins the work of a person in a workplace, well and good. But the problem is that the proposition that that can happen on an overall basis across the work force is against the history of employment and against the experience that people do have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, if a person has great skills, if a person is well equipped with a particular sort of learning that is in demand, then he or she can demand a high price. But even people as highly skilled, as dexterous and as dedicated as our Australian cricketers feel the need to have some agreement between themselves, to have some association that they can go to and put forward propositions that are not only in their interest but also in the interest of the game generally. It is the same for footballers. They have an organisation which was led for a long while by the illustrious Justin Madden from Carlton. He did the same sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our experience is that we do need organisations. We need as leaders of those organisations people who can put forward propositions about how employment should be undertaken and propositions about those things which are not only fair to the employee but also fair to the employer. We must never forget that the employer is part of the transaction. The employer is the person who provides the management, the knowledge and the capital to ensure that the workplace functions properly. The concept that management and employees should work together is a great concept. The issue is not whether that should happen but whether the machinery by which that should happen is well provided for. In this legislation and in these suggested amendments the machinery by which that should happen is not well provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments have been made to the powers of the Employment Advocate. This particular piece of legislation extends the range of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7880"> people to whom the duties and responsibilities of the Employment Advocate can be delegated. That is of some concern, because the Employment Advocate, within the scheme of the government's legislation, has been given more and more powers and more and more rights. The satisfaction that will or will not be obtained in the workplace depends very much on what the Office of the Employment Advocate does.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable concern about the extension of those powers across the range of people who are concerned with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The best way for the employees to do business in the workplace is by having their own representatives, and that is what the union provides. If you look at the Workplace Relations Act itself, you will see that many provisions talk about how representatives of the work force are to be elected. That is properly the situation. The union representatives themselves, the people who represent the workers, are to be elected according to ballots carried out by the Electoral Commission. There are all sorts of laws to make sure that those elections are properly determined and are fair, to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to vote and to make sure that the vote is properly taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So there is great scope within the union movement for unions to represent workers&mdash;as they should be&mdash;and to carry out that negotiation with employers, which is so necessary to ensure not only that we have a society that is wealthy through the production of goods and services but, even more than that, that we have a society that is fair. That is what we all want: a society where everybody has their place and where everybody is given their proper dignity as a person; a place where cultural activities can be carried out and where social justice prevails&mdash;it is an old, hackneyed phrase but it should be because it is so true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill again changes the Workplace Relations Act, which itself changed the Industrial Relations Act and which, in turn, changed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The issue of the proper relationship between the workers and managers will always be subject to legislation because it is always changing. It is an organic thing; it is an area 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where everybody tries to strive for justice and fairness, which is the subject of debate here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very big difference between the government and the opposition on this matter. While the opposition believes that the best way of achieving that justice and fairness is through a freely elected democratic union movement, the other side says that individual contracts are the way to go. I think history, experience and instinct say that our assessment that there has to be a collection of people in negotiation is right.</PARA></SPEECH>

As a result of its reduced role, the AIRC was forced to wait until the dispute was clearly affecting the public interest before it could act. That dispute, which is essentially about workers wanting to adhere to their rights and existing conditions and about job security, is still unresolved. Over 200 people at the mine have taken voluntary redundancy since then. The matter is regarded as so important by the AIRC that the newly appointed president, Judge Giudice, will hear it himself. I am very pleased to hear that someone is taking this dispute seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take great exception to the comments by Senator MacGibbon yesterday regarding his views on the culture of mining towns. I had the privilege of visiting the Curragh mine in Blackwater during that dispute, and it was a very peaceful picket. I was impressed by the morale and the fact that they were determined to conduct the strike in accordance with the laws of the land. They did everything by the book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most strikes are conducted in this fashion, Senator MacGibbon, and that is why not a lot of media attention is given to them, which was the case at Curragh. When workers are on strike for a long time, they and their families are hurting. If they are provoked by the company and the government, then of course they will react&mdash;anybody would and so would you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The miners enjoyed overwhelming support from the other townsfolk in Blackwater who supported them both financially and emotionally during that strike. In return, those miners 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7881"> worked for the townsfolk doing odd jobs, repairs, painting everything in town that needed painting and things such as that to repay them for their support. The International Park was one of those projects. I do not think I have ever seen Blackwater looking so good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments made yesterday by the government about the freedom of workers to leave their jobs really demonstrates their level of concern for people in outback communities&mdash;thank you for sharing that with us! The sense of community displayed by the miners at the Curragh mine towards the townsfolk and vice versa is not something to be ridiculed or belittled. It is admirable and, dare I say it, reflective of the kind of community spirit that John Howard hankers after in the good old days. Mateship is, after all, a traditional Australian value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation does not provide avenues for what to do next once agreement cannot be reached between management and workers. Given that some of these disputes are occurring in major export markets, I would have thought that the government would have had a vested interest in resolving disputes, not inflaming them and holding workers, their families and other Australians to ransom for the sake of pushing an ideologically driven point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Newlands Open Cut mine in Queensland outside Mackay was until recently negotiating an enterprise bargaining agreement&mdash;that is, until management spat the dummy and decided to sack their workers instead. The Federal Court issued an interim order only last Friday to prevent these sackings from occurring. I have here a letter from Newlands Coal which is addressed to the CFMEU in Queensland. In this letter, they have the temerity to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . . as a result of your union's insistence that any retrenchment be undertaken in accordance with Clause 24 of the Production and Engineering Award, we made application for the removal of Clause 24 from the Award as it applies to Newlands Open Cut.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is absolutely bizarre, not to mention unAustralian, for the company to say, in essence, that since the union insists on following the legally binding, mutually agreed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions of the award, it will seek to have the clause removed. I would also suggest that the independent and objective consultants hired by Newlands Coal&mdash;yes, and paid for by them&mdash;to assess workers for their suitability or otherwise have been quite rightly regarded by workers and their unions with suspicion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed changes to repeal section 170LJ(3a) are contrary to the rhetoric of freedom of choice expounded continually by this government. The removal of safeguards such as those which aim to ensure that workers have sufficient time to give informed consent to certified agreements which are up for approval are completely inconsistent with this so&hyphen;called freedom. The only freedom the worker will have is the freedom to accept the agreement or the freedom to be unemployed. The government must be thinking how lucky they are to have managed to get their work for the dole legislation enacted. At least workers in that position will have the so&hyphen;called freedom to volunteer for that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, what is a new worker supposed to do if a new employer chooses to negotiate a certified agreement just prior to hiring a number of new employees? What kind of real choice are those people going to have? How will you guarantee that they will have sufficient time to understand the proposed agreement so that they are giving informed consent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reliance of the Queensland economy on agricultural and mining products, and the demographic dispersion of people in that state, can only increase uncertainty for Queenslanders in regional and rural areas in particular. The increasing Americanisation of our industrial relations system is ironic, not least of all because many employers in the US who have traditionally used contract labour are learning that while there may have been some short&hyphen;term gains, in the longer term they lose out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aggravation of disputes in small country towns with regional unemployment problems and often, at best, very limited opportunities for economic growth will not help other small businesses in those areas. Actions such as these have a direct and negative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7882"> impact on workers and their families, and on other workers and their families in small regional economies with few employers or employment prospects. So much for this government's rhetoric of `for all of us'. It is no wonder that there is a growing and vocal backlash from people in the bush about the policies of this government. These people are doing it tough. Worse, they are the very battlers that John Howard claims to represent and who he is not supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flow&hyphen;on effects of job insecurity for workers in these regional economies heralds a grim future for many more people than just those who are unfortunate enough to be directly affected, and who will be affected if this bill is passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I want to sum up in a little more detail than usual. I think a number of senators have made important points, although there is clearly a very fundamental divide between the coalition and opposition parties. In relation to industrial relations matters generally, in this first of the amending bills to the workplace relations legislation it is important for the record that we set out the important aspects of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to make technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and other legislation. The amendments are aimed at clarifying existing provisions and ensuring that they operate in the manner originally intended by the legislation. The bill also corrects some drafting anomalies and oversights which have led to minor errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments have been discussed with both the ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry through the National Labour Consultative Council's Committee on Industrial Legislation. The bill includes amendments suggested by both the ACTU and the ACCI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCI has indicated its support for the amendments and, for the most part, the amendments are not opposed by the ACTU. The ACTU certainly agrees that most of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments are technical in nature. As to the few amendments that the ACTU says are not technical, we disagree with that view for reasons I will explain shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the proposed amendments contained in the bill as introduced, the government will be moving a small number of additional amendments. I indicate to the opposition, who have sought an indication about this, that we will ensure those amendments, which are being tidied up a little as we talk, are distributed as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments deal with the disamalgamation provisions and the definition of the term `independent contractor' for the purposes of the freedom of association provisions of the act. The opposition has objected to a number of our proposed amendments. In reality, the opposition's objections to the proposed amendments amount to no more than the fact that they object to the role of the Employment Advocate. That was certainly made clear by the opposition in the debate on the original bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has wrongly claimed that some of the proposed amendments have increased the powers of the Employment Advocate and, as such, the amendments are not technical. In the government's view, this claim misrepresents the nature and intention of the amendments. In relation to the discretion to waive technical defects, one of the amendments would give the Employment Advocate the discretion to waive strict compliance with elements of the filing procedures in circumstances where the Employment Advocate considers that that waiver would not disadvantage a party to an Australian workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of a power to waive defects, the Employment Advocate has had to return a number of AWAs lodged because the applications failed in some very minor way to meet the filing requirements, such as omitting the employer's Australian company number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capacity to waive minor defects is a sensible technical amendment aimed at ensuring the smooth operation of the AWA provisions and eliminating unnecessary delays and procedural burdens. It is a commonsense amendment. It is in keeping with the intention 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7883"> of the AWA scheme&mdash;that is, to provide a simple and speedy means of formalising agreements entered into by employers and employees. To suggest that the amendment amounts to an increase in power for the Employment Advocate is absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment makes clear that the advocate will have to be satisfied that the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AWA. There will still need to be strict compliance with the substantive requirements such as the provisions relating to the no disadvantage test and genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be waived. This will avoid the waste of time and resources involving correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of the parties to an AWA are properly protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another proposed amendment extends the time limit for filing an AWA from 14 to 21 days after it is signed. This is a simple, practical change designed to assist AWA parties, especially those in rural centres. It could hardly be described as increasing the Employment Advocate's powers. The bill provides for AWA parties to choose to obtain assistance in explaining the operation of their AWA to the Employment Advocate. This amendment will help AWA parties who have not appointed a bargaining agent or do not wish to utilise the services of a bargaining agent for the purpose of explaining the operation of their AWA to the Employment Advocate. Again, this amendment simply does not amount to an increase in the powers of the Employment Advocate. They are just sensible arrangements to ensure that that office works effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to accountability, the opposition has wrongly asserted that there is a lack of accountability in the AWA process. It has suggested that the advocate should provide written decisions. Where an agreement meets all the relevant statutory requirements, including the no disadvantage test, there is just no point in the advocate wasting time and resources preparing written reasons for decisions. It is just creating unnecessary bureaucratic burdens and unnecessary paperwork.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A requirement to publish decisions would do nothing to improve the operation of the AWA arrangements. It would just simply delay the approval of agreements. Contrary to the claims made by those across the aisle, AWAs are not secret documents. Any party to an AWA is free to disclose the content of his or her AWA to anyone and the act specifically provides that an agreement must not include any provision that prohibits or restricts disclosure of the details of the AWA by either of the parties to that AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AWA provisions of the act provide extensive protection for employees. These protections are explained in the information statement which employers wishing to enter into AWAs are legally obliged to provide to their employees. This information statement is a detailed booklet prepared by the Office of the Employment Advocate. It explains that, to be approved, an employee must genuinely consent to the agreement and that the agreement must meet the no disadvantage test. The information statement explains how the test operates and provides advice about the appointment and role of bargaining agents. It makes very clear that an employee cannot be dismissed for refusing to sign an AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Employment Advocate can only approve an AWA if it clearly meets the no disadvantage test. If the Employment Advocate has any unresolved concerns about whether the test is met, the advocate is obliged to refer the agreement to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The AIRC may decide to have particular AWA determinations published if it wishes to do so, and this is a matter for the discretion of the commission. Any determination which is to be published must be edited to ensure that it does not disclose the identity of the AWA parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where any concerns about compliance with the no disadvantage test are resolved by written undertakings given by the employer, those undertakings are deemed to be part of the agreement to which they relate and are therefore enforceable as part of the agreement. The fact that the AWA approval arrangements are streamlined does not mean that the employee protections are compromised. A simple 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7884"> examination of the Workplace Relations Act and the amending bill makes absolutely clear that the opposition's objections are entirely without any foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the no disadvantage test. The opposition has also wrongly claimed that our amendment to the no disadvantage test provisions lowers the benchmark for the test. We argue that this claim simply demonstrates a lack of understanding of the amendment on the part of the opposition. Where the no disadvantage test is being applied to an agreement made under the act and the employees concerned are covered by a federal award, then that federal award will form the benchmark for the no disadvantage test. Where the employees concerned are not covered by a federal award, the Employment Advocate in the case of AWAs, and the AIRC in the case of certified agreements, must designate an award to form the benchmark for the no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that a state award may be used as the benchmark only if there is no federal award covering the kind of work performed by the employee or employees to be covered by the proposed agreement. This amendment is necessary because, in some instances, it will not be possible to identify a suitable federal award. The ACTU understands the need for this amendment and does not have any difficulty with it. Unfortunately, the opposition seems to have misunderstood it. I genuinely hope that that explanation makes it clearer to senators opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to termination of employment, the opposition also seems to have misunderstood the proposed amendments to the provisions dealing with the application of state laws in relation to the termination of employment of an employee covered by federal awards or agreements. The Workplace Relations Act ensures that federal award or agreement employees who are, for constitutional reasons, outside the scope of the federal unfair dismissal remedies are not deprived of access to a state unfair dismissal remedy. The amendments will not affect access to state unfair dismissal remedies. What the amendments do is simply make clear that the existing provisions do not give federal employees 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to entitlements under other state laws or awards dealing with termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to freedom of association, the opposition wants to retain the right to include void preference clauses in agreements and awards. Such clauses contravene the freedom of association provisions of the act and are completely unenforceable. The inclusion of these void clauses amounts to an exercise in futility, but, more importantly, the opposition is apparently unconcerned about the risk of employers and employees mistakenly taking these void clauses at face value. This could result in employees being disadvantaged and employers inadvertently being in breach of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I quickly summarise. The minor changes we are proposing within this amending bill will assist in giving effect to the major reforms which have been achieved through the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act. The act is delivering genuine flexibility and choice for employers and employees at the workplace level. Nearly 4,000 new agreements have been certified since the act came into operation, including about 140 agreements made directly between employers and employees. In addition, over 2,000 AWAs have been approved by the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have an act that is much better balanced than its predecessors. It reinforces a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the system. Section 127 of the act is providing an effective remedy to prevent and stop illegitimate industrial action. Over 160 applications for section 127 orders have been dealt with by the commission to date. This bill is designed to clarify certain provisions of the act and ensure that it operates as intended. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I rise to speak on the 1996&hyphen;97 annual report of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, including the Auditor&hyphen;General's report on section 4(1) of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989. I speak to this tonight because of the announcements made in the last budget. One of the most regressive elements in the 1997 education budget was the slashing of nearly $40 million from Abstudy over four years. If there is any chance of reversing or changing this decision then it is important to speak up. I believe that this situation is currently being reviewed. I would like to believe that this is so. I was at Senate estimates when questions were asked of Senator Vanstone&mdash;the minister at the time&mdash;and there was an indication that there really was not much idea of what the impacts of such a move were going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The predecessor to Abstudy was established in 1969. Apparently there are now around 43,900 Abstudy recipients in both secondary and tertiary education. Abstudy differs in a number of ways to Austudy. It grants additional benefits to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in recognition of the social and, therefore, educational disadvantage faced by indigenous Australians. For example, the benefits are higher. This government has done a lot without recognising why such schemes were implemented in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics show that only 33 per cent of indigenous Australians complete secondary education compared with 76 per cent of the rest of the population. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of indigenous Australians do not complete year 10 while this is the case for only two per cent of the non&hyphen;indigenous population. It is important to note that participation rates have improved steadily at the rate of 20 to 50 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7886"> cent between 1991 and 1995, admittedly starting from a low base. That low base has allowed those figures to show a speedy improvement. In the late 1960s when the Aboriginal study grants scheme was introduced there were only two indigenous students in Australian universities. This year there were nearly 7,000. It is important to emphasise this point because the current policy is at least partially effective in improving the situation in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts of about $38.7 million, or about eight per cent, to Abstudy over the four years are made up of many relatively small changes which have all had the effect of abolishing or reducing benefits. These changes include reductions in course approvals, abatement rates, the number of undergraduate and postgraduate courses that are able to be undertaken, eligibilities and awards, school fees, allowances and travel assistance. Travel assistance has been extremely important&mdash;and that includes away from base assistance where it is proposed that a limit of two return trips per year be introduced for travel related to minor essential elements of a course such as field trips and residential schools. DEETYA has estimated that 550 students will be affected by this measure and they have cut, they say, $1.65 million from the budget. I believe the figure might be quite a lot higher than that. It also includes cuts to the incidental allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, as I mentioned, has announced a review of Abstudy in the context of other student assistance programs such as the proposed common youth allowance. Given that Abstudy recognises the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians&mdash;and is thus a more livable allowance that those to which it will be compared&mdash;the review is extremely concerning. It may also be another example of this government announcing significant change and subsequently undertaking a review of the area. This is not the way to go. If you are going to have a concerned and thoughtful approach to education and if this is, in fact, about efficiency&mdash;and I believe that it is not; I believe it is about scapegoat politics&mdash;then you do the review first and do

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wool International is a statutory body established by the Commonwealth under the Wool International Act 1993. It began its operations in December 1993, replacing the former Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Its key responsibilities are the management and sale of the stockpile and the repayment of the commercially funded and government guaranteed debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission was set up by the previous government to sell the stockpile and, of course, reduce the debt which at that stage was $2.8 billion, largely government guaranteed, and 4.5 million bales. The previous government set up the realisation commission with the priority to reduce the debt and to reduce the stockpile. For the first two or three years, the reduction of the debt was the pre-eminent reason for its existence. In fact, it did quite a good job in difficult circumstances, but it had the effect of pushing the price down to such a low level that the wool industry looked like it was not going to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, Wool International was set up. Its priority, of course, was to reduce the debt but it was also to reduce the stockpile, and it did so by selling a set number of bales per quarter. In the intervening years, between 1993 and 1997, the stockpile has been reduced substantially. At the end of June, it was at 1.7 million bales and it is now down to about 1.45 million bales, and the equity in the stockpile is now worth quite a lot of money&mdash;in fact, about $850 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are now in a position where Wool International's priority is no longer to reduce the debt. It is basically to manage the sell down of the remaining 1.45 million bales in the stockpile and to return the capital to the stockholders, those woolgrowers who have stuck with producing wool over the last four 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7887"> years. This is the reason for its existence now. The legislation was changed earlier this year which allowed for the amendments which specified that from 1 January 1997 the maximum quarterly delivery of stockpile will be raised from 192,000 bales a quarter to 350,000 bales a quarter and the minimum reduced from 182,000 bales a quarter to 135,000 bales a quarter, and this quarterly minimum was further reduced to 90,000 bales from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now in a position where we will shortly be able to provide some very good news to woolgrowers because the first tranche of money that can be repaid by Wool International, which is the first repayment&mdash;around $84 million, which is approximately 24c for every dollar of wool tax paid&mdash;will be paid out in early November. The question the government has to face, and it is of very great interest to woolgrowers, is the treatment for tax purposes of this first tranche of repayments. Woolgrowers hope it will be within the rollover provisions of capital gains tax changes which have been set in place to help small business. If that is the case, it will be treated as exempt if it is put into capital assets of the farming operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury has yet to give that advice, but I can assure all woolgrowers out there that I will be pushing very hard the Treasury, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to make sure that this hard won contribution which will be coming back to wool growers in early November will be treated as exempt from capital gains tax. It can then be put into the operating capital in assets of operators who have found it very difficult over the last few years to increase their operating profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry is still going through very difficult times. Wool International continues to be comfortable with its forward sale position, and the stockpile is about 1.4 million bales, but the eastern market indicator has not moved as encouragingly as it might have. It is still hovering at about the 700c mark, which for many wool growers, especially specialist wool growers, is not profitable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend what my National Party colleague from New South Wales, Senator Sandy Macdonald, has said. I am merely following up what he has said. He comes into this chamber with a wealth of valuable experience in the industry and he has been a fine representative of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to address the Wool International annual report of 1996&hyphen;97. It is worth going back some seven years to the gestation period of Wool International. It was a time when the previous government had put in place a chain reaction that decimated the industry. It started a very long seven years of misery for the industry and for individual and family farmers. Without going into the machinations, which are well known to the industry and to individuals and families, I will simply make some points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was mismanagement of the floor price scheme which saw its eventual collapse and abolishment. This created a downward spiral of the commodity price where, at certain times, the eastern market indicator was less that 400c per kilogram. The market indicator was very much like that because of a government that created anxiety and uncertainty in the marketplace where it did not have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember also that the early 1990s coincided with a manufactured recession in which interest rates were deliberately ratcheted up. The industry could always protect itself against a drought or, for that matter, a commodity price collapse, but it could not protect itself against interest rates of 25 per cent, added to a commodity price collapse. If I remember rightly, there was not a declared drought at that time, but there was certainly uncertainty about the weather. With those three forces upon it, the industry got off to a very bad start in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this backdrop, the result was a $4.5 billion stockpile of bales overhanging the industry and the marketplace, and some $3 billion in debt. It was a time of great anxiety and uncertainty in the industry. It was in this atmosphere that, in 1993, Wool International was created to manage the sell&hyphen;down of the stockpile and to reduce the debt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7888">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was Wool International's singular mission. As it said in its first report of 1993&hyphen;94, it was given a fixed sales schedule, starting from 1 July 1994, under which 187,000 bales per quarter were to be sold. Under very strong pressure from the industry and some commonsense, this fixed sales schedule was changed in January 1997 to a far more flexible method of sale, whereby the quarterly minimum sale of bales was reduced to some 90,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 report that we are discussing today says at page 7 that this decision recognised the process to date in selling the stockpile, the more manageable debt level and the difficult financial circumstances of many wool growers. Indeed, the time had come to change the management of the stockpile to a far more flexible sale price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also said that the federal parliament approved additional conditions that set a target of repayment of the debt by 31 December 1998, and stipulated that the stockpile must be sold and the last bale delivered on or before 31 December 2000. The good news is, as my colleague said, from the disastrous position in 1990, with the overhang of the stockpile, we can now fast&hyphen;forward to 1997 where that stockpile is an asset and some $84 million is the first dividend to be paid to farmers. It is good news, and hundreds of millions of dollars more are to be paid from that stockpile dividend.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Honourable senators will realise that this is a report which I have been watching keenly over the last few years. I have also been watching with interest reports from the Auditor&hyphen;General in relation to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. As with most of these reports, I will appreciate the opportunity to read it in more depth, but I would now like to note a few items that have appeared in this year's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those items is the report on fatigue, stress and occupational health. There have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been many speeches given in this parliament about the issues of crewing levels. It appears that a research team analysed the responses of the study and presented a draft report to the Study Steering Committee in May 1997. The final report will be formally handed to AMSA in the near future, following steering committee approval. I hope that we will have access to that report to see what the implications are for fatigue, stress and occupational health at a time when there have been a number of changes to the crewing levels on ships, especially ships in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that the report refers to ships carrying livestock. This is mentioned on page 40 of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the regulation of livestock ships</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two livestock ships were lost in 1996 after loading at Australian ports. The first, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which has been debated in this chamber&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">caught fire while carrying a cargo of live sheep to the Middle East, and a crewman died. The second, Guernsey Express, carrying a cargo of cattle, sank with no loss of human life after encountering heavy weather associated with a cyclone on a voyage to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a pity the report did not mention the number of livestock which drowned in those voyages. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA offered assistance to the ships' flag States to help investigate these accidents. To date there is no objective evidence to show that the nature of the cargo contributed to either of these two total losses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, what they have said is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following these incidents a number of changes to the relevant Marine Orders were prepared, following extensive consultation with the industry and taking into account recommendations received from the AMSA Livestock Advisory Committee. These changes include the introduction of an Australian Certificate for the Carriage of Livestock, compliance with the International Safety Management Code and other amendments to the SOLAS Convention. More stringent requirements for maintenance and onboard storage of bulk fodder were also introduced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 41, there is also mention of port state control inspections. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following concern that ship inspections and subsequent action may not be uniformly and consistently applied at all Australian ports, an internal review is being conducted to gauge the current level of uniformity and develop means by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7889"> which nation wide consistency can be achieved and maintained. This review is to be concluded during the second half of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously that is going to be very important if people are thinking that there might be certain ports in Australia where they might be subject to less scrutiny than others. It is very important that we know what that situation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that as I read through this report I will find many other areas. I will be looking forward to any comments that the Auditor- General might be able to make at some later stage as to how AMSA is going with its safety issues in Australian ports. I am always interested in the ongoing improvement of safety in Australian waters. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that we are going in the right direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak on federal road funding and on the road that links Melbourne and Geelong, the Princes Highway west&mdash;a road that links two of Australia's biggest cities. I want to speak as a Victorian senator about a critical issue facing the state. I promised when I became a senator that I would represent the interests of the people of Victoria, and tonight I intend to focus on an issue primarily affecting the people living in the corridor between Melbourne and Geelong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The city of Geelong and its region has a long and proud history. In 1824 the explorers Hume and Hovell travelled overland to the western shore of Corio, where Geelong now stands. Thirty-three years later, in 1857, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7890"> railway between Geelong and Williamstown opened, and two years later this was extended to Melbourne. The Geelong to Ballarat line opened in 1862.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geelong flourished in the 1850s as a port of entry for gold prospectors and, before the turn of the century, the port had become a major trading hub for the export of wool to Britain. The port remains a great asset to the city today and has now grown to be Victoria's largest bulk port, exporting wheat and grains, wool and other primary produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geelong has, in the past, always enjoyed an impressive transport network, but Geelong has suffered badly too. In the 1980s, under the Cain-Kirner Labor governments, Geelong watched as industry failed, the Pyramid Building Society collapsed and the town experienced the decimation of jobs and pride&mdash;a decimation for which Labor governments became well known. These experiences gravely wounded Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geelong is now getting back on its feet. I am glad to say that Geelong has revived as a centre for industry and transport. Distribution centres have reappeared, transport terminals have been established and the warehouses and cool stores so necessary for trade have reopened. Pride is now returning to Geelong, and it is again taking its proper place in the Victorian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Geelong's great historical strengths&mdash;its transport links&mdash;continue. The port of Geelong, the Avalon airport, the national standard gauge railway and the transport terminals all contribute to an impressive transport network, but the roads servicing Geelong are not so impressive, particularly the Princes Highway west. Before elaborating on the problems of that highway, I want to record my sincere disappointment in the lack of action on this issue by the member for Corio. The Princes Highway passes through his electorate, and this forms the main link between his electorate, the produce rich western districts and the city of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 40,000 vehicles travel every day between Geelong and Melbourne and more than double that between Werribee and Melbourne. But does the good member Mr O'Connor raise the problems of that road in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the other place? Does he show his concern for the residents in his electorate by seeking a better road which will contribute to the greater economic growth of the area? He does not. In fact, he shows remarkably little interest in this very major issue. The member for Corio even goes so far as to term the road `one of the region's quality transport assets'&mdash;something it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot really just blame the member for Corio for this sad neglect of the interests of Geelong residents. After all, Mr O'Connor is merely reflecting a long-term Labor neglect of the Princes Highway west, of Geelong residents and of all Victorians who use that road for economic and personal reasons. It  was the Labor Party which sold the Geelong road and Geelong down the drain when it restricted road funding. The ALP restricted direct federal road funding to the national highway and this is why the Geelong road and all its users are suffering. It was, of course, the Labor Party which diverted $750 million of road funds to upgrade the Pacific Highway. Strangely, it did this just before an election. But the road did run through a couple of very sensitive marginal seats!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, on the other hand, have a very good record on roads. After all, we are the ones who reintroduced black spot funding when we returned to government. The Labor Party had cut it out after the 1993 election. Black spot funding directly contributes to saving lives in the community. The coalition have reintroduced this funding and it is the coalition who have chosen to consult for the first time with the community regarding the use of this funding. It has also been the coalition who have recognised the importance of the Calder Highway and made it a four-way standard to Bendigo and the national standard to Mildura. The coalition have recognised and acted on the need to substantially increase national road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Geelong road is not an asset; it is a very dangerous road, made so by the general neglect of infrastructure by the last Labor government. Make no mistake, the road is dangerous. It averages more than one death every 10 kilometres every year. There are 2.5 casualties per kilometre per year and over 100 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7891"> casualty accidents seriously injuring 180 people per year. Yet it is only 64 kilometres long. So why has it not received better funding? The economic links and benefits of the road are undisputed. It links Geelong and its many associated industries with the port of Geelong, with Werribee, with Melbourne and with the various industries there. In terms of trade alone, nearly 40 per cent of Australia's exports flow through the two ports of Geelong and Melbourne, both serviced by the Princes Highway west and the Westgate freeway, roads which need upgrading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic links are also evident in freight movement along the highway. Freight is moved from Geelong to markets in Melbourne, interstate and overseas. Last year nearly six million tonnes of long distance freight was moved on the Princes Highway and Westgate freeway between Geelong and Melbourne&mdash;and, as I have said, the port of Geelong is Victoria's largest bulk shipping port. The area is a transport and distribution hub for many companies and the infrastructure supporting the subsequent freight movements is vital to Australia's trading position and to our future economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of upgrading this road are obvious and indisputable. Not only could many accidents be avoided but the National Institute of Economic Industry Research in 1995 also reported the following benefits of upgrading the Princes Highway west: an impact on national GDP of $800 million, four times the investment required, a benefit to cost ratio of four to one; a result in Commonwealth revenue of 32 per cent of the increase in GDP, $256 million; a result in permanent job growth of 4,500 people; and a reduction in freight costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today this parliament witnessed yet another peaceful demonstration against the government's abhorrent treatment of Aboriginal Australia. It was a moving gesture and one which symbolises the ground swell of community support for reconciliation. I want to mention these very public displays of frustration at the current government because they symbolise the dedication and commitment of many Australians who are sick and tired of the punitive approach to Aboriginal affairs by the Liberal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Canberra today, 100 concerned citizens, lecturers and students attended a demonstra tion relating to cuts to Abstudy. I am told that a second protest will be occurring tomorrow. These protests are a direct response to the cuts to Abstudy announced in the last budget. I wish to draw this chamber's attention to the impact of changes to Abstudy proposed by this government. These changes demonstrate yet again that this government has deliberately and unfairly targeted the Aboriginal community. Aboriginal people face unique obstacles in accessing and participating in higher education, but this government is not interested in assisting Aboriginal education. In fact, it is not interested in assisting anyone's education; it is just interested in cutting expenditure, regardless of the social costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last budget cut almost $40 million from Abstudy benefits. This mean-spirited approach to Aboriginal education follows a $400 million cut to ATSIC funding. Aboriginal education should be a priority for this government and it is its duty to appreciate and understand the difficulties and obstacles faced by Aborigines living in remote and rural communities. If this government recognises the special needs of indigenous students, as Senator Vanstone claimed when she was minister, then its response is a damning indictment of this government's attitude. This government has limited the number of courses for which assistance is provided and changed the additional incidentals allowance, away from base assistance, compassionate travel and graduation travel entitlements. This is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7892"> the type of recognition that Aboriginal students need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the Senate's attention to the devastating and harmful effects that one of the government's proposed changes will have on Aboriginal students. I would like to refer to away from base assistance. Sydney's Macquarie University currently offers a diploma in community management for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people who have shown appropriate communication skills and who are working in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Macquarie's diploma course has enrolments from Aboriginal students from all over the country. Only Curtin University in Western Australia offers a similar diploma course. This course provides basic pre-tertiary education that aims to help indigenous people overcome historical disadvantages. The diploma course teaches Aborigines how to locate and use information, how to write submissions, how to formulate and manage financial matters and how to deal with management and legal dilemmas. Recently, accountancy and land and resource management units were added to the course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Macquarie course is designed to allow working indigenous people access to study. Students come to Macquarie four times a year for a period of two weeks under a provision known as block release. They complete 18 separate units of study for which they earn enough credit points to enter into general university courses. In other words, here is a scheme that assists indigenous people in gaining skills and qualifications that are then used to benefit their communities or organisations. There are over 80 students enrolled in this three-year course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This diploma course has already produced health service and management graduates as well as teachers and administrators. In the last three years, 14 students have been accepted into postgraduate or undergraduate courses. Five Aboriginal diploma graduates are now enrolled in masters degrees, while four are studying commercial law. None have dropped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This course has facilitated the education of Aborigines in the very management skills that they need to control their own affairs and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finances. It will help overcome the unsubstantiated accusations of financial mismanagement that this government alleges are rife within Aboriginal administration. These changes to Abstudy are nothing more than miserly and penny&hyphen;pinching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changing the away from basis assistance means that Aboriginal students will not be able to gain sufficient  credit points to enter other university courses. In other words, the whole aim of the diploma course will be negated. It gets worse. A proposed three-year bachelor teaching degree focussing on early childhood education may no longer proceed because it too uses a block release scheme that enables Aboriginal students to attend practical placements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to Abstudy will prevent Aboriginal students from studying in courses that are comprised wholly or substantially of away from base components, such as residential schools and field trips. This will preclude many indigenous students from studying at Macquarie University. It may mean that 78 currently enrolled students will not be able to proceed with their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the message here? That you can live in your own community but the government will not assist you in getting an education because they are too stingy to assist with travel and accommodation for people who historically have very low higher education participation rates. No-one can deny those statistics. On the one hand, Senator Herron berates Aborigines for not properly controlling their own affairs while, on the other hand, Minister Kemp seeks to deny them access to the very courses that are designed to achieve that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike budget changes to HECS under which continuing students are not affected, Aboriginal students will be forced to withdraw from a program designed to benefit all of Australia. Without continuing students, Macquarie University may have to close down its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs unit, forcing even more Australians out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about a great deal of money in a budgetary context. Approximately $278,000 will allow 90 indigenous students to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7893"> complete a diploma in community management. Even a government that is driven by economic rationalism would have to acknowledge the enormous benefit that such a small amount of money provides. Remember, we are talking about a specially designed management course for Aborigines, a course that will benefit the entire nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Vanstone, prior to being demoted, had confirmed to the National Tertiary Education Union that Abstudy changes were under review as the government had underestimated the impact they would have on Aboriginal students. I trust that the new Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) will reaffirm that Abstudy changes are not fair or equitable. I trust that the Minister Kemp will support Senator Vanstone's declarations that Abstudy changes are not in the best interests of Aboriginal students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that the former minister had offered deals with individual universities to assist them with the away from base scheme for just one year. In other words, in a cynical attempt to hose down yet another racially divisive issue, this government is quietly saying to those universities with indigenous programs, `Here, we'll help you out in the short term but our aim is still to attack educational schemes aimed at assisting those most disadvantaged.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These courses were established specifically to overcome the lack of skills and education Aboriginal people are perceived not to have. They are designed to increase the number of professional managers in Aboriginal communities across Australia. Cutting the away from base allowance can only be described as an attack on Aboriginal education. This decision must be reversed. I urge those who are taking the time to express their dissatisfaction with this government to persist. Your message is a critical one and the government must be made not just to hear it but to act on it and resolve these issues.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7893"><TITLE>Native Title</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past few weeks I have been a member of the committee that has been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reviewing the amendments to the Native Title Act. We have been looking at amendments which will make the act more workable, and we have taken evidence from dozens of groups all around Australia. There is general agreement that the act needs reworking. It needs amending to make it more workable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10&hyphen;point plan follows a commitment made by the coalition during the lead&hyphen;up to the election to simplify the Native Title Act whilst respecting and accepting native title itself. The amendments reflect hours of consultation by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his advisers as well as discussions with a number of the major groups affected by the changes: Aboriginals, farmers, miners and the resource development indus tries. The experiences that they have related to the committee have reinforced the urgency of the need for amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, I would like to tell the Senate of the experience of one pastoral family in a remote area in Far North Queensland. The experience of this family was related to the committee during its hearing in Cairns. Alan and Karen Pedersen of Karma Waters Station purchased the grazing land that they now occupy in February 1991&mdash;well before Mabo and well before Wik. Two years later, when they submitted a three&hyphen;year management plan, they were told that native title or any residual native title that may exist on their property would need to be extinguished prior to any tenure upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A non&hyphen;claimant application by them resulted in a claim in May 1995 by a group of people known as the Sunset Yalangi people. The Pedersens subsequently drove 200 kilometres down to Cairns to attend a pre&hyphen;mediation meeting convened by the President of the National Native Title Tribunal, Mr Justice French, the claimants themselves, the Cape York and North Queensland land councils and representatives of two Queensland government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the claimants were given two months to prove their traditional claims, the Pedersens spoke to the claimants after the meeting and agreed, in principle, to their request for access to significant sites and areas of cultural importance on the property. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7894"> Imagine their surprise when only a couple of days later, the North Queensland Land Council advised them that they&mdash;the North Queensland Land Council&mdash;wanted exclusive rights to the land and the right to occupy and manage the land!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mid&hyphen;June, four of the Sunset Yalangi elders of the claimant group and a land council representative came to the property and, after discussions, it appeared that there was sufficient common ground to negotiate an agreement with the claimant group. One month later, the claimants had amended their claim to omit any claim to exclusive rights to the property. It seemed that commonsense and the desires of the claimant group&mdash;and, in particular, the desires of the elders of the group&mdash;were actually going to prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, in July, five Queensland government bureaucrats came to the property to spend three days inspecting dams, fences, waterholes and pastures. Five weeks later, more Queensland bureaucrats came for another three days to look at some old mine sites and some other improvements. The Pedersens were becoming cautiously optimistic&mdash;maybe the Native Title Act was workable. Another month went by and the land council and two claimants returned and it seemed that commonsense would indeed prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, on 11 and 12 September, a formal National Native Title Tribunal mediation took place with Justice Robert French, a tribunal vice&hyphen;president, a case manager, a Perth&hyphen;based land council barrister, another solicitor, two Queensland bureaucrats and 50 members of the claimant group. A heads of agreement was set down with more detail to be added later. The Pedersens thought they were getting somewhere&mdash;that the Native Title Act was working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November, the land council sent an anthropologist to spend a week at the property. A week or so later, the Pedersens again drove south to look at the agreement and left believing they had the support of the claimant elders. Two days later, at yet another mediation meeting, the Native Title Tribunal representative and the claimant's Perth based barrister&mdash;he was back in Cairns&mdash;pressed the Pedersens to hand over the right to occupy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the land with a non-renewable lease for the family, a proposition which, not unusually and probably not surprisingly, the Pedersens refused. Their offer was then withdrawn. By now, they had spent $13,000, without their legal expenses, and they had received $4,800 in legal aid from the federal government. A sense of despair was starting to descend on this family and a sense of farce was taking over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June last year, yet another mediation took place and listen to who was there&mdash;Justice French, a tribunal case manager, three bureaucrats, seven members of the North Queensland Land Council, two members of  the Cape York Land Council, 10 claimants, some miners and some shire representatives. Almost 30 people were there, along with the increasingly confused and despondent Pedersen family. The North Queensland Land Council's proposal required the Pedersens to surrender their lease to the claimants, who would then lease it back to the family on terms which were totally unacceptable to both the Pedersens and the Queensland government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October last year, the matter was referred to the Federal Court, and two directions hearings have already been held. The Pedersens are now seeking further legal aid for the Queen's Counsel, the barrister and the anthropologist they will require, and they have been told the case could cost more than $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the past three years, this family on a remote Queensland pastoral property have endured endless inspections, meetings, legal briefings and mediations, with people they have never met roaming all over their property inspecting this, that and everything else. They now face the Federal Court to confront, as adversaries, the very claimant people they agreed could have what they asked for back in 1995. What a farce! No wonder nearly $90 million has been spent on native title claims so far with only one agreed small settlement. And no wonder the wealth&hyphen;generating industries of this nation have become angry and frustrated at the current, clearly unworkable Native Title Act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Pedersens and hundreds and thousands of other families in this country&mdash;pastoral families like them on remote country stations all over the country&mdash;deserve better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 September this year, the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody, in a speech at the CEDA conference in Adelaide, raised the issue of the taxing of trusts on the same basis as companies. This is an issue that the tax reform committees from the Treasury and the coalition will also be examining as part of the tax reform process. The question is: should income receive the same tax treatment, irrespective of the vehicle that is used in deriving it? Mr Carmody suggests that, since `trusts have increasingly been simply an attractive business structure,' the ATO believes `it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration what should be the appropriate treatment for tax purposes.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two examples that he gives are, indeed, good ones. Firstly, when company dividends are paid out of profits that are subject to building allowances or accelerated depreciation, they are taxable in the hands of the individual shareholder, whereas distributions from a discretionary trust are tax free. Secondly, a similar result is achieved when a distribution by a company is received through the revaluation of an asset, compared with the distribution of a trust from the same type of revaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that there is more than just a simplistic change if we are going to treat trusts as companies. Therefore, I do hope the tax reform groups will look at other issues of taxation, including the changes to the capital gains tax. For example, there may necessarily be changes to the question of the reduction of the cost base of the underlying asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second consideration before automatically accepting change or taxing trusts as companies is to compare the efficiency of each vehicle. In other words, the various reform committees should examine the possibilities 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of improving the dividend and imputation system should trusts be taxed as companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third consideration is what impacts such change would have on collective investments which are structured as trusts. A fourth consideration is that these two committees should examine the alternative flow&hyphen;through methods that are available in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, which allow shareholders of some companies to be taxed ahead of the company. The fifth consideration is that a so&hyphen;called deeming approach without extensive legislative backup is fraught with potential difficulties and legal problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, coming back to Mr Carmody's speech as Commissioner of Taxation, I would have thought that he and his department would have direct representation on at least the Treasury committee. So I ask the question: what was his motive in raising the trust issue at the CEDA forum in Adelaide? If it was to open up the public debate, the contribution is, indeed, welcome so as to bring forth responses such as mine tonight in this chamber. There was a somewhat similar approach by the Taxpayers Association in their recent journal, No. 7 of 29 September 1997, and hopefully we might get other approaches from the tax professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, if Mr Carmody feels excluded from the reform process, then that is a more serious issue which I believe should be raised during the Senate&hyphen;Treasury ATO estimates hearing. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7895"><TITLE>Native Title</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the other place today, the member for Calare (Mr Andren) made an extraordinary claim. I take particular exception to it. Firstly, I take exception because I have been misrepresented and, secondly, I take exception to being criticised by somebody like Mr Andren who does so little research into the matters on which he speaks that he is quite patently and absolutely ignorant. Mr Andren said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Wik case, Senator Bill O'Chee and others have been peddling the myth that native title tenure is the same as freehold title when, if they bothered to look, the courts have repeatedly stated this is not the case. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7896"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Anybody would understand that native title, if it coexists with a leasehold tenure of land, cannot be the same as freehold. It is quite clearly the case&mdash;they are inconsistent tenures. It shows that Mr Andren does not bother doing his research. It shows that Mr Andren really is not interested in getting to the facts of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will point out what I have said before: that there are Aboriginal activists, for example, Father Frank Brennan, who will tell you that when a leasehold tenure expires&mdash;because they say that native title is permanent and a leasehold tenure is only temporary&mdash;at that point in time native title revives in full and, in its fullest form, it should be treated as a freehold tenure and should prevent the renewal of a leasehold interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those on the other side of the chamber who will disagree with my views on native title, but it was very clearly intended when the original legislation was passed that such claims would be prevented. Of course, they have not been prevented and, in fact, people like Father Frank Brennan have made that claim a number of times. Father Frank Brennan made that claim to me here in Parliament House when we addressed a group of young school students earlier on this year. Father Frank Brennan has made that claim in a number of public places. That is why the legislation which the coalition brings forward in the other place contains provisions which prevent native title preventing the renewal of a lease. That is what we seek to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Andren obviously does not bother to look at the facts, obviously does not bother to acquaint himself with what I have had to say and obviously has only a very vague interest or understanding of what native title is really about. If he understood what native title is about, then he would understand that this legislation is of great significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not seen the whole of Mr Andren's speech but, from the extract I have seen, it seems that Mr Andren is rather critical of the coalition's point of view. If that is the case, then it is important that the rural constituents in his electorate understand that his equivocation, his negative point of view, on this legislation&mdash;because he seems to think that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this legislation goes too far&mdash;means that he is basically holding their title out to risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is designed to remedy not just the people who have leasehold title to agricultural properties but also many different cases. For example, you can have town commons which are subject to claim. Whilst it is perfectly reasonable to have a claim on a town common, it is unreasonable to let that claim preclude development on that particular town common. Anybody living in a small rural town with a town common which is in Mr Andren's electorate of Calare should now know that Mr Andren not only fails to under stand native title but also, by his equivocation, is putting the development of those rural towns at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that Mr Andren started to look at the facts and to look at what is really going on in Australia. Maybe he ought to equate himself with what we have said in North Queensland. I commend to all honourable senators and I commend to Mr Andren the learned and eloquent speech we have heard tonight from Senator Ferris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By his comments, Mr Andren seems to think that our amendment legislation goes too far. I would say to him that he should speak to the constituents of mine who have appeared before the committee of which Senator Ferris is a member. Mr Andren has not bothered to acquaint himself with any of the evidence which has been presented to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Obviously, that is too much hard work for Mr Andren. He just wants to flit around these issues; he does not really want to do the hard yakka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Andren is more interested in getting his face on television than in making a serious contribution to the governance of this country. That is a great tragedy for the people of his electorate, because I believe they elected him expecting a little bit more. There was a lot of rhetoric from Mr Andren at the time, but there has been no substance to back that rhetoric up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that Mr Andren apologised to me; it is also about time that Mr Andren apologised to his constituents, because his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7897"> blatant and utter ignorance of these issues means that he is incapable of exercising a proper vote and incapable of representing them.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer, based on advice from Telstra, to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Telstra has indicated that it considers it to be a common business practice for the provision of services to customers and the nature of their business relationship with their service provider remain confidential to the customer and service provider. Telstra also considers that it would breach the confidence and trust of the customer's relationship with Telstra where every customer that Telstra attempts to build a business relationship with is expected to disclose the detail of those dealings to Parliament. Telstra further considers that to make such disclosures would seriously undermine Telstra's or any other company's ability to conduct business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These standard business practices are reinforced by Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997, which deals with the protection of communications. Under Part 13, carriers and carriage service providers are prohibited, except in certain limited circumstances, from disclosing personal information about customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) See answer to question (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) See answer to question (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Telstra advises that it has an employee Code of Conduct which sets guidelines for the expected behaviour of employees in their dealings with customers and suppliers. The Code of Conduct deals with issues such as dealing with suppliers of goods and services, customer services and general principles for the provision and acceptance of gifts, prizes and hospitality.</PARA>
