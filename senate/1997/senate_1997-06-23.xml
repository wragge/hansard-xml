<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator FAULKNER</EMPHASIS> (New South Wales&mdash;Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (12.32 p.m.)&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. Let me address the committee on the matter that Senator Kernot raises. In fact, I think it might be useful for me to outline what the opposition's approach will be to the remainder of the committee stage debate on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I advise the committee that I will not be proceeding with opposition amendments (7) to (15) standing in the name of the opposition. The opposition will not be moving any further amendments to the bill and will not be supporting any of the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would be aware, Mr Temporary Chairman, last Friday the Senate dealt with opposition amendments (5) and (6) to the work for the dole bill and, in our view, those two amendments were the critical amendments to the bill. They would have turned the work for the dole proposal into a decent labour market program. They sought to restrict the secretary's power to approve a program of work for unemployment payment so that the secretary could approve such a program only if: participants in the program did not displace existing workers; participants were paid for the hours they worked at the relevant award rate; participants were provided with accredited on&hyphen; or off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training; participants were able to leave the program to take up education training or employment opportunities without penalties; the people running the program were funded to cover any costs associated with supervision, materials, workers compensation, essential clothing, equipment and so on; and the program ran for at least six months. We believe that the work for the dole program is sensible only if it provides guarantees to existing Australian workers that their jobs are safe and if it provides participants with those benefits, especially access to training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make sure that the focus stays fairly and squarely on this government and on the jobs crisis that it has created in this country. In one month, in Australia, 40,000 jobs have just disappeared. Unemployment has shot up from 8.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent since this government took office. There are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4828"> now 57,400 fewer full&hyphen;time jobs in Australia than at the time of the Howard government's first budget in August 1996, and nearly 50,000 fewer than in January 1997. Yet the government obviously thinks that it can deflect the public's mind from this crisis with a program of some 10,000 places in a work for the dole scheme. These are 10,000 places in a scheme with no training, and they will not even make up for the jobs this government has just destroyed in a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's amendments, as moved in committee on Friday, were the only amendments&mdash;and I stress that: they were the only amendments&mdash;which would have actually moved the government's work for the dole scheme in the direction of Tony Blair's welfare to work program. In recent days, both the government and the Democrats have said that they support Tony Blair's approach, which of course is fundamentally different from the work for the dole scheme in that it gives the unemployed various options, including education and training. But the government and the Democrats have voted against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do agree with the government on certain aspects of the work for the dole program. As senators would be aware, we agree that it is not a training program, we agree that it does nothing to address structural problems&mdash;which, of course, have led to high unemployment&mdash;and we agree that it does not create a single real job. They are the government's words. Let me stress: we agree with them. But we do not, and we never will, buy the government's arguments that this program is about improving unemployed people's self&hyphen;esteem and their work ethic. There is absolutely no evidence in Australia or anywhere else to support the government's proposition. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary: that programs of this kind will actually harm the unemployed people they are supposed to help. The program may lower a person's self&hyphen;esteem, demoralise them, stigmatise them and make it even more difficult for them to obtain the real work that they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me summarise the situation, as I have been invited to do, that is before the committee at the moment. Let me also summarise the arguments that were developed in committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last Friday. Senator Kernot said that, if a sunset clause were to be inserted in the legislation, the Australian Democrats would not support opposition amendments Nos 5 and 6. The Senate did vote to insert a 24&hyphen;month sunset clause, and the Australian Democrats did not support our amendments. Senator Harradine certainly voted for our amendments. Senator Colston, despite all the rhetoric and, of course, being the coward that he is, voted against these amendments&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training say on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio program this morning that the actions of the Senate will delay the commencement of the program. I want to make this absolutely clear to Dr Kemp and absolutely clear to the government and to the public of Australia: Dr Kemp and everyone else really knows that the government's work for the dole program could start tomorrow. There are no impediments to the work for the dole program starting tomorrow. The government does not need to pass anything in this bill before the program can start. But Dr Kemp is saying, `Let the government get on with it.' The Labor Party, in these circumstances, says to Dr Kemp and the government, `Get on with it. Don't use Senate obstructionism as an excuse because there is none and there never has been any.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be on the government's head when the work for the dole program fails, and fails miserably, and when our young unemployed Australians become even more despairing of ever finding a job. It will be on Dr Kemp's and the government's heads when that occurs. That does outline, as I have been requested to do, the approach that the opposition will be taking during the remainder of the committee stage. I commend that approach to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Some of these amendments are the same as the Labor Party's amendments. They all go to the heart of whether this scheme should be compulsory or not. Subject to their passage, I will then revisit amendments Nos 11 and 12. I would still want to move amendment No. 13.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address some comments Senator Faulkner made. There has been a significant shift in the Labor Party's position over the weekend. We all know why that is so, and it has got nothing to do with the fact that a sunset clause was passed. It has got everything to do with the fact that there is not a lot of community understanding out there that this bill, as it now stands, can apply the principle of work for the dole to most unemployed Australians. I think Senator Faulkner's comments really show us that the rhetoric about Senate obstructionism is a matter of some concern to them&mdash;as it is to us. I think it has been totally misrepresented by Minister Kemp in this and other debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said there were two critical amendments. There are two that I have chosen as being critical. Firstly, the sunset clause. I repeat that is a critical amendment because the bill as it stands does not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reflect what the Prime Minister told Australia he wanted to implement. He said, `We are going to implement a pilot program for 10,000 young unemployed Australians.' In fact, this bill applies the principle of work for the dole to nearly all unemployed Australians some time in the future, whenever the government wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think that that is appropriate. There are competing principles here. On the airwaves in the last 24 hours the minister has talked about `All we are seeking to do is to apply the principle of work for the dole.' Yes, but this government is seeking to apply that principle without further parliamentary scrutiny when they choose to extend that principle to those who were not part of the Prime Minister's announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the minister said on Friday, `We want to extend the principle and we do not want to come back.' Yes, you want to extend the principle of work for the dole from 10,000 young, unemployed Australians to whomever you see fit in the future, and the competing principle is that it is surely inappropriate to do that without further parliamentary debate upon an evaluation of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see those as the two crucial amendments. First, you cannot implement a scheme that you can apply as you see fit without any further parliamentary debate and scrutiny and, the second was the principle of compulsion versus voluntarism. Labor does not want to test the notion of compulsion any more; the Democrats do. That is why I have moved these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We firmly believe that if the government had given young people a choice of options and less of a stick than loss of total benefits&mdash;something more in line with the Tony Blair four options plan with loss of 40 per cent of benefit at the end if young people fail to cooperate and find an option that works for them&mdash;that would have been something much easier to vote for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is a miserable, one&hyphen;off, non&hyphen;negotiable option, the details of which are not even clear to this parliament before we are asked to put in place the big picture, the principle, that we are being asked to vote on. That is why we would like to test the matter. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4830"> Labor Party's rhetoric up until this moment has been: `We are opposed to the notion of compulsion.' I do not think the explanation that is being given&mdash;that the Senate would not agree to make these labour market programs&mdash;helps the Labor Party slide out from why they have walked away from their opposition to compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not belabour the point, because we are all acutely aware of the rhetorical battle and the misrepresentation that is going on out there in the wider community on this point. But on a point of principle that is why I have moved Democrat amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which oppose the notion of compulsion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to respond to Senator Brown, because he was not present a little earlier when I did actually go through this in some detail. I am happy to make another intervention in the debate. I will try to make it as clear as I can for you, and I am sure that you will understand the position the opposition is taking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did inform the Senate a little earlier, Senator Brown, that the Labor Party would not be voting for these amendments that are currently before the chair or for any other amendments to the bill, due to the failure of others in the Senate to support our crucial amendments 5 and 6 in the debate that took place in the committee on Friday. I do ac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knowledge, Senator Brown, that you supported those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has made it clear from the outset in this debate that the government's work for the dole scheme is a punitive, mickey mouse scheme that will do nothing to address Australia's high and rising level of unemployment, including of course the rate of youth unemployment. On Friday in this chamber I moved detailed amendments which would have built improvements and protections into the scheme and would have transformed the scheme into something positive. But the failure of the government and the Australian Democrats to support these crucial amendments makes it impossible to improve this scheme into the skills training and labour market program that Australia's young unemployed now so desperately need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and others on the Labor side made it very clear early in this debate that we would be presenting a clear and a better alternative to the work for the dole scheme, and that if the government did not accept that alternative then it would have to wear the consequences of a flawed scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of the work for the dole scheme are that Australia's unemployment will get worse; it won't get better. So on Friday in the committee stage I moved an amendment to require that this bill not allow any project to proceed unless there be a legal requirement that the scheme will not cause persons in employment to lose their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also said in the debate on Friday, as senators would recall, that this clause was crucial, based on overseas experience. In the United States, work for the dole programs have pushed thousands of paid workers out of jobs; laws have needed to be passed to prevent displacement of paid workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are widespread and escalating concerns about job security amongst workers in this country right now. The last thing that Australian workers need is more insecurity about their jobs. Yet, of course, we had a situation where government senators and others voted against our amendment to protect job security. Senator Kernot does not like 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4831"> this, but the Australian Democrat senators voted against it too, as you would recall. So, so much for any highfaluting concerns about jobs and job security. Numerous community groups made it very clear to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that this scheme would not be of any use unless it had accredited training opportunities built into it. The amendments that I moved on Friday sought to make that happen too. But again, the government and the Democrats have prevented this from occurring by voting the amendments down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been using the work for the dole bill to try to divert attention from its abject failure to reduce unemployment in Australia. It has been trying to take public pressure off itself to generate jobs and turn the public pressure on to the unemployed, to blame them for not being able to get work. That has been the government's strategy. What we in the Labor Party say is that we will not allow it to succeed in that strategy. The Labor Party will not allow the government to manipulate the prejudices which exist in the community against unemployed people into a debate about compulsion or non&hyphen;compulsion to work. Senator Kernot invites me to make some comments about compulsion, so let me do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that I moved here on Friday were to give unemployed people options for training and skills development as part of the requirements on them to receive unemployment payments. The main issue in dispute between the Labor Party and the government is therefore not compulsion itself, but the value and quality of the programs in which the unemployed are required to participate. The failure of the Senate to improve the quality of the program, in our view, makes it absolutely pointless for us to proceed further with these amendments. By not supporting further amendments, we will be ensuring that jobs is the issue in the future&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have here is a poll driven response, and I am very sorry to see that. It is possible, of course, at the end of this debate, for any party to look to see whether the Social Security (Work for the Dole) Bill is supportable or not and then vote for or against the bill. And there could be efforts made at the moment to gain support for that. But, looking around the Senate, because it is a poll driven debate, for all the fine words that are mentioned here, people are putting their fingers up and seeing which way the wind is blowing in relation to the populist talkback radio and the tabloid response, which is often very misleading. Well, it is not a game. It is not a game for all those people who are likely to be badly affected by this and the families of those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible to vote against the bill. I certainly have not seen anything in this bill which would allow me to support the bill, but as I look around this chamber I am not sure that other people are not putting their fingers up in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing. It is not good enough that this is the way the Senate responsibility is taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot about scapegoat politics in the last few weeks. It is about finding a victim and blaming the victim. It is also about standing back while other people do that, albeit successfully, as a populist cause. I will quote from Martin Niemoeller, a German theologian who lived from 1892 to 1984:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Hitler attacked the Jews I was not a Jew, therefore, I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not a Catholic, and therefore, I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of the unions and I was not concerned. Then, Hitler attacked me and the Protestant church&mdash;and there was nobody left to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder how many people in this populist response to unemployment, to blaming the victim in Australia, are doing it because they themselves are not unemployed; they themselves do not know how difficult it is and how demeaning it is and how little opportunities there are and that the government are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4832"> helping in their response in all different sorts of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like you to know that there are people in the community who will stand up, no matter what that wind is doing, no matter what that populist, knee&hyphen;jerk, scapegoat response will be. I do think it is disgraceful for people to take a knee&hyphen;jerk response now. The Greens will be continuing to try to improve this bill, knowing that there is not the guts in this chamber to stand up for what is right and what is wrong. We will be continuing to try to improve it because we know there are not the numbers there to have the courage to oppose a bad and wicked bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go back to the arguments about compulsion versus voluntarism and preface my remarks with the observation I made on Friday that it is so interesting the way the Liberal Party hates compulsory voting but loves to compel young unemployed people to work for the dole. The bill talks a lot about mutual obligation and the Labor Party has an amendment which uses the term `reciprocal obligation'. The notion of mutual obligation underpinning the provision of income support is a shift and I think most people identify that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to shift, then a reciprocal obligation must surely be the way to go. It is one thing to compel young people to turn up and put in some hours, hopefully in some work experience, but it is another thing for the government to say that it has no reciprocal obligations&mdash;that is, to provide training and to provide a job at the end of the so-called work experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is dishonest to make a big point about mutual obligations and to absolve the government from any longer term meaningful responsibility for young unemployed Australians&mdash;for all unemployed Australians. The government has an obligation. It has a reciprocal obligation. That obligation involves meaningful training and job creation. The bill requires young people to turn up for 2&half; days a week where, in the best circumstances, they might get some training. I acknowledge that local councils have said that they may have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the capacity to provide some meaningful training, but a lot of other groups have said they do not and therefore are wary of being involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the important point about compulsion is the message it sends. It says to all of us, `It is not the government's problem. It is your problem that you are unemployed; therefore you have to take the responsibility rather than the government taking the longer term responsibility.' I will read from the Senate committee hearings what I think are some pertinent comments from people who have experience in this field&mdash;probably a lot more than we do. The leaders of four of Australia's Christian churches stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notion of mutual obligation between young people and society is damaged by the compulsory nature of this scheme. We the community also have an obligation to provide training, jobs, as soon as possible, and a minimum payment to survive. The compulsion threatens to undermine voluntary work, it risks deploying youth as cheap labour and it has the debilitating image of earning handouts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know that there are arguments you can mount against that. It does send a strong message that you blame the victim and do not take any further responsibility. The Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory schemes marginalise the unemployed, tell prospective employers nothing about a young person's enthusiasm for work; they ignore existing skills and create no real or lasting jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However you want to look at it, unfortunately these are some of the deficiencies in the way this scheme is designed. I have said so many times that if it had been better designed I think we would have found it easier to support it. The last piece of evidence I want to quote is from the Brotherhood of St Laurence's witness, Ms Macdonald. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's program represents and promotes the belief that unemployment is a problem because of deficiencies in individuals, like being unmotivated or lacking a work ethic, rather than recognising that there is insufficient demand or growth in the economy to employ all of those who want to work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the reality. But we all know about the populism attached to this issue. The community out there thinks that all we are doing today is putting in place a pilot program for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4833"> 10,000 young unemployed Australians. We are not doing that. I do not have second thoughts that we could expect 10,000 young Australians to volunteer&mdash;whether they would be in all the right areas is another matter. Until the design is better and until there are better safeguards and guarantees we should not pretend, firstly, that this bill can do what it may not do and, secondly, that it applies only to young unemployed Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a strong feeling that what we will end up doing is moving towards an ideology which is that providing you set the market and provide the conditions for the market then everything will be okay. I would like to debate at least one of the points that Senator Kernot made&mdash;which is that providing we have sufficient demand and growth then jobs will pick up. I think it is choices you make within the paradigms that exist. I am prepared to agree with Dr Clive Hamilton, who says that you can in fact make choices within your community. There are many times when there are choices available within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can make choices, for instance, about whether you put your resources into providing energy by using coal or very lumpy technologies which are very capital&hyphen;intensive or you choose that you are going to provide energy by energy conservation efficiency means which are cheaper and provide more jobs. But, no, it tends to be parts of industry that make that decision. It is not an overall decision. We do not have a process at the moment which actually says, `Where do we want to head? Do we want to head for greater equity, greater employment, a more fair society or a society that is going to be economically and socially sustainable?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making choices in our society which lead to job shedding. Even with so-called growth in our economy, the growth that is there does not necessarily lead to employment. The growth we are seeing at the moment is still resulting in a shedding of jobs. Therefore, what we have to look at is what kind of choices are being made. Whatever twiddling around the edges of these kinds of issues we are doing at the moment, we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> still basically blaming those people who are not in any way responsible for the structural unemployment that exists. Instead we see people pushed to work longer hours. We are seeing this government pushing to extend the working life of people. By restricting people's access to superannuation, they are going to try to punish people for not working longer. There are all sorts of ways that the logic of structural unemployment has not hit home with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues the government should be dealing with are these. How is industry changing in Australia? How is our trade affecting our industry decisions? How are people being affected by whether or not they have jobs and how their jobs are affecting them? How many people with individual contracts are working more and more hours, sometimes unpaid&mdash;many times unpaid these days&mdash;as part of their contract conditions? How do we have a situation where people are getting sick from over&hyphen;work and people are getting sick from under&hyphen;work?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order. I have listened carefully to Senator Margetts. I do understand that we are debating quite specific amendments moved by the Leader of the Australian Democrats which relate to compulsion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking to the point of order, the connection will become clear. I think the problem is that the government has not understood that connection. I would argue that the connection is quite clear. It is the fault of the government that they are not seeing that connection. I will be happy to continue and explain what that connection is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are debating a scheme to blame the unemployed&mdash;that is what I am talking about&mdash;instead of dealing with the issues that have created unemployment. Yet we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4834"> saying, `We can blame them, we can make it compulsory, because it is their fault.' You punish the unemployed for being unemployed. You rip up money from the training areas. You do not provide the money that is necessary for the education of the people who do want education. You punish those people who do not fit into the system. That is the argument in relation to compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those very issues of structural unemployment&mdash;issues of how we have changed our trade and industry policy&mdash;are extremely important to this debate. They are extremely important because if you use a compulsory measure for those people who find themselves unemployed then you in fact are simply creating a noise to shift people away from asking the questions that they are really interested in&mdash;`How did this happen? What kinds of decisions could be taken to move us out of this situation which we have got ourselves into and for which we are digging a bigger and bigger hole?' That is the connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very aware that many people in the government do not understand the connection. I do not believe that is my fault. I believe there must be effort to listen to what is happening in the community instead of grabbing on to the cheap scapegoat kind of answer that is coming out. The Prime Minister has even had the gall to criticise people like the member for Oxley for going for cheap scapegoat points in politics. If there were ever a cheap scapegoat point, this would be one of them. It is not just about racism. It is not just about scapegoating people who cannot fight back.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem here is that the majority in this Senate, if you listened to the second reading debate, is in favour of picking up on the compulsion in this bill and doing away with it. The majority in the Senate believes that the job training program should have a skills component. In other words, we should take the nastiness out of what the government has called a work for the dole scheme by making it optional and by providing a skills component so that people who take it up at the end of that time are more ready and able to get a job in the full-time work force. That would seem positive. That is sensible. That is logical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened over the weekend? We are now seeing the Senate backing off. The Senate is backing off because the Democrats did not insist on the skills and training component because the Labor Party is no longer insisting on the compulsion component being removed. The two parties Labor and Democrat, who agreed to both those components last week, are now saying, `If you do not agree with my bit, I will not agree with yours,' and the government is getting a down the rails run to the finishing post.

I say I am right, and the Greens will be amending the legislation privatising Commonwealth employment services in so far as it is open for those employment services, as the legislation stands at the moment, to put into the work for the dole scheme people whom they do not want on their books. That is our reading of the legislation. I will stick with it and I will move the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to see here is the Senate take its collective breath. If the Democrats and Labor Party cannot agree, the government will get its own way and those young people will face a forced period of work, as against their friends, their compatriots, who are not in the same situation. They will get selected out for this forced work program. We want to ensure that we do not put them in that punitive situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner quite correctly referred to the overseas experience. In New York, some 36,000 people have been placed on compulsory work programs. In the process, they have displaced 20,000 full-time jobs in things like park management, secretarial work and street cleaning. This is another fall&hyphen;out from this discriminatory punitive program the government wants to put through the Senate. I agree with Senator Faulkner that it is also going to see long-term jobs with proper wages and conditions lost as compulsory work programs take up those jobs because they are cheaper. They can be made out to be temporary but, with the rollover of this scheme, they can be turned into permanent displacement of full&hyphen;time jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Kernot and Senator Faulkner to think again. I ask them not to insist that they get the better of this, thereby losing everything. I ask that both parties stick to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> principles they espouse of removing both the compulsory component and the failure of this scheme to provide skills training.

We are dealing with amendments moved by Senator Kernot, concerning matters about which there was a lot of debate on Friday last week. I am disappointed that they were defeated. I am greatly disappointed. Nevertheless, it generally falls to the committee process to improve the legislation as best we can. At the end of the day, if we do not like it, we then vote against the third reading. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be most unfortunate if the Senate did not give a very clear message to the government as to what it thinks about compulsion versus non&hyphen;compulsion. We have the opportunity to do this with this particular amendment. I think it would be unfortunate, to say the least, if the opposition did not see it that way as well. I think the opposition has an enormous opportunity at the present moment to register its views about this particular question of compulsion versus non-compulsion. If, at the end of the day, they do not like the bill anyhow, they can vote against it. That is my prerogative as well. But let us give the government and the people of Australia an indication as to what we think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that it is reinforcing the principle, as it sees it, of mutual obligation. The government is saying that these obligations go to a proposition that they say is fair and reasonable, that persons in receipt of the dole payments should have to work for the dole; in other words, that unemployed people should sing for their supper. The government believes that it is fair and reasonable that people receiving unemployment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowances from the community should be required to make a contribution in return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of questions arise from that, including whether the measure applies to all recipients of the dole or just the 10,000 unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 24. The question arises whether it is fair that one group be singled out in this way. These are debates that have gone to and fro, but it is essential that we look at this question again when considering this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side, on the non-compulsory side, one has to realise, and the committee needs to realise, that unemployment benefit is in fact a right. If unemployment benefit is, in economic terms, a transfer of payment resulting from the government's and the community's failure to provide employment, should such a payment create an obligation on the part of the recipient of that payment? Should unemployed people be made to feel guilty about not being able to get a job? Should they be made to feel guilty about receiving what is a perfectly legitimate payment by being forced to undertake tasks which have no prospect of leading to meaningful employment in that particular area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question that does arise&mdash;and this has been debated in the public arena&mdash;is: what impact does compulsion have on a person's self-esteem? In relation to compulsion, I will refer to a submission made by the Salvation Army to the Senate committee. Again, I would like to say that I am indebted to the Senate committee for its work on this particular matter. Whilst I am on my feet, I would also like to pay tribute to those Senate officers who prepare running sheets. I do very much appreciate it when they are provided to the committee. But the Salvation Army says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that forcing people to accept unsuitable options has any benefit to the individual, the project activity or indeed other participants on the same program. Our experience has shown that it is preferable to promote the positive aspect of participation rather than simply compel people to attend. As a result of discussions with our staff with experience in other parts of the world, we have concluded that compulsion is a sure way to ensure that such a scheme does not work. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4838">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So that is a very telling response from the Salvation Army. In any event, I believe compulsion would probably be unnecessary to sell to those unemployed persons a scheme for them to be able to participate in. Is the government saying that most would not want to participate and, therefore, it needs to be compulsory for the program to operate? Certainly the government's proposal in the bill appears to insinuate that the unemployed do not want to work. I am sure that is not the government's view, but that is what sort of message is coming though the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the question of unintended consequences has been canvassed in another sphere, but I think it is desirable for the committee to amend the bill. Even though the bill will still be imperfect, it will not be as imperfect as it would have been if we had allowed this particular clause to stay as it is. That is what our job as a committee is&mdash;to attempt to improve where we can. Then in the final analysis, if we do not like it, we can vote against the third reading of the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to deal with some of the comments Senator Brown made. On Friday, the Labor Party supported the Democrat amendment to insert a sunset clause. At no stage did they say, `If this gets through and you don't support our labour market amendments, we are going to walk away from compulsion.' We came to this debate this morning expecting to continue on that line. The Labor Party have changed their minds on that. I think, despite what you say about us disagreeing, the fact of the matter is that it is politics. That is the reason. It is not a lack of formal agreement between us or a falling out between us. It is just the way this has worked out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of a sunset clause and compulsion, we are not walking away from our desire to remove the compulsory aspect of this bill. We are going to put those amendments. We are going to call a division on those amendments. On the matter of the labour market programs, I wonder if the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is able to give us any indication of what those extensive amendments may have cost.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said all along that I think skills, training and a job outcome were very important. I have also acknowledged that, if this were a real pilot program for 10,000 young unemployed, I think you would get mostly volunteers and, also, you would get some schemes that worked. I was prepared to extend to the government one opportunity to put in place the trial that they set, with some safeguards, and an opportunity for all of us to evaluate it so that they could not extend it, at whim, to all unemployed Australians. I do not think that is an unfair position to have to argue. It is the Labor Party that has changed its mind today. We know that and the vote will reflect that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(1.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In direct response to Senator Kernot&mdash;who raised during the last division the question of the cost of the Labor Party's amendments on labour market programs&mdash;I am advised that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not have a costing on those amendments, except the advice is that they would be very expensive. In that context, I point out that in the new work opportunities program, which was in the last year of the Labor government, there was a four per cent success rate and a net cost of $143,000 per job. That may give Senator Kernot some idea of the sorts of costs that Labor has been prepared to see in the past in terms of these kinds of programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is certainly not the direction in which this government is prepared to go. It is not simply a question of cost. We believe that the money that is available from measures such as Working Nation is more appropriately put to helping individuals, as effectively as we can, try to prepare themselves to obtain work. For that, it might be that somebody needs to get the skills for work that is available in their locality. It might be that they have English language problems or literacy problems. But we feel that the money that is available is much better spent on a more flexible system than we have had in the past that goes to the real needs of individuals in the community in which they are looking for work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4839">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the new program, which Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp have been working on, is much more likely to contribute to good outcomes than something like that new work opportunities program, which produced only a four per cent success rate. This, of course, is not a labour market program. We have always said it is&mdash;and we do not make an apology for it&mdash;an initiative with a very specific purpose, because we believe it will lift the self&hyphen;esteem of young Australians. New jobs&mdash;real jobs&mdash;come by other means, and  that was referred to in the second reading speech. I do not want to replace the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deny utterly Senator Margetts's claim that this is all about blaming the victim. We believe that some of the most serious victims of the last government's economic management are those young people who have left school with inadequate skills, have become long&hyphen;term unemployed and have now lost their self&hyphen;esteem. While the total program is not geared solely to those who have so lost their self&hyphen;esteem that they will not come forward to volunteer their service to their community, there is a substantial and often hidden element about whom that is the truth&mdash;that they have lost all confidence in their abilities. We want to help them particularly, and that is one of the reasons why we think the compulsory element has real virtue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question of blaming the victim. It is a matter of helping those who have become victims because of the recession that, if you like, we had to have&mdash;youngsters who left school and found that, while there might have been a short&hyphen;term job, there was no long&hyphen;term job because they did not have the skills to keep it or to find another one. We are very serious about trying to help these young people of 18 to 24. It is very appropriate that we first have pilot programs and evaluate very carefully how they succeed. With the evaluation process, it is important to take a compulsory element into account as well as a voluntary one, and in some communities there will need to be a mix of both. The concept of mutual obligation between the community and the unemployed is a very important aspect of this scheme. Under this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concept, it is fair and just that people be asked to contribute to the community in return for their unemployment payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not apply only to those who wish to work for payment. It should apply to everyone. If one group of young unemployed volunteers to participate in the scheme, it is only fair that others in similar circumstances be asked to participate. Those who do not volunteer to participate in the scheme are likely to gain the most from an increase in self&hyphen;esteem, a stronger work ethic and the social contacts that they would develop while on the scheme. If the pilot projects were to rely solely on volunteers, there may be insufficient people in some places to fill the available spots. We need the option of being able to refer people to projects where there are vacancies. It is a pilot scheme, and in order to evaluate its success we need to be able to compare different models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any case, the arrangements in that sense about compulsion are similar to those that existed under Labor's labour market programs where participants were required to participate as part of the activity test or their activity agreement. Some young unemployed 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds&mdash;for example, those with very low self&hyphen;esteem&mdash;may lack the confidence. To compel them to participate may be the only practical way to demonstrate to them that they can make a real contribution to the community, thereby improving their confidence and work skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do say that, as a government, we want to give the potential sponsors&mdash;the community organisations&mdash;as much flexibility as possible, and sponsors who have some reservation about compulsion will be able to put forward proposals which are for 100 per cent voluntary programs as their first choice. But there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient volunteers available for any one project, and the government cannot enter into a contractual arrangement with a sponsor on that basis. Consequently, all potential work for the dole sponsors will have to sign a standard form of contract that will make provision for the referral of compulsorily referred potential participants where there are insufficient volunteers.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said. We know they mucked it up. Young unemployed are currently able to receive $100 a fortnight more than students. That is what they did. But at least the Labor Party of 1987 recognised that we needed a system which encouraged study and skills development. But what about the ALP of 1997? Where do they stand?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would be delighted to do that. I am also pleased that Senator Schacht has finally decided to come into question time, because he will be particularly interested in this new program. The program was officially launched last Friday. It is a $250 million fund. It is the one that Labor fought tooth and nail to stop coming into operation and it is one that will bring enormous benefits to the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having fought tooth and nail against it, Senator Schacht had the absolute gall to put out a press release recently saying that there was nowhere near enough. This is the mob that did nothing for the bush in 13 years and certainly were not interested in the problems that people have in many rural and remote areas in terms of access to high&hyphen;speed telecommunications services&mdash;the fact that you could wait sometimes up to 27 months to get a new service delivered or the fact that you could have congested lines. Some people with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> digital radio concentrator systems are only a few years out of party line arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is clearly an enormous need there. What we did on coming to government was to speed up the digitisation of the networks so that we will have 100 per cent in the not too distant future to guarantee that there will be ISDN connections to 93.4 per cent of the population by 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above all of that, this new networking the nation project is designed to enable the local communities, wherever they are around Australia, to identify the problem areas that they have and to apply for real, live government money to try to make the difference&mdash;to enable the bush to cease being second&hyphen;class citizens, a situation they have been confined to for so many years by Labor, to start to get in touch with the information revolution and to leapfrog and get access to the latest technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will make an enormous difference. There are already examples in places like Walcha in New South Wales where there are telecottages enabling people to get access to an affordable range of skills, processing contracts employing up to 30 people at a time. In northern Victoria some 17 farming families have been able to get in touch with the Asian markets via e&hyphen;mail and establish a very live business in terms of marketing and selling vegetables to Asia. That has increased the profit per hectare by several hundred per cent in that region alone. It is an example of what can occur when you are plugged into the Net, when you are plugged into the telecommunications revolution. In Narembeen in Western Australia there is now a telecentre serving some 1,000 people which is looking at becoming involved with a pilot project in Western Australia for telemedicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for the first time what we will see as a result of this fund is, I suspect, an enormous number of applications that will exceed the funds that are available over the five&hyphen;year period. It will enable communities to make applications&mdash;in conjunction, in some instances, with private sector enterprises. But it is not designed to subsidise commercial activities; it is designed to fill in the gaps to ensure that for the first time people do have access 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4845"> to those services they have always wanted but have been cruelly denied to them by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very successful initiative. I am delighted that we had a full house there on Friday. I am delighted that Doug Anthony is chairing the board. They will have a very difficult task in setting the priorities, but I have no doubt that when they do and as they go they will be bringing enormous benefits to rural Australia. They will very much appreciate that this government understands the needs and appreciates what opportunities are available through the telecommunications revolution.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gases is about 1.4 per cent. As Senator Hill pointed out here a week or so ago, if you closed the whole of Australia down the impact on global CO2 emissions would be negligible.

The challenge is to arrive at an outcome which can serve as a basis for future rounds of climate change negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is a balanced approach and one that is in the interests of Australia. The outcome must be realistic and achievable to ensure an effective environmental outcome. It must be fair and equitable&mdash;a viewpoint that has been taken by a resolution put before the US Congress. Targets must not impose unequal costs on countries. The economic impact on each Australian should be the same as for each American, Canadian, European or Japanese.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome must be cost-effective. There must be flexibility to achieve emission reductions at least cost. The outcome must take account of individual circumstances for each country by ensuring differentiated country commitments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, if you are asking whether this government wants to ditch its youth allowance at this point, you are clearly whistling dixie in a west wind. It is not going to happen. You may as well just accept that this government has been prepared to rejig the incentives so that incentives are there for young Australians to go into further education&mdash;into vocational training or on to university or at least to complete year 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you should understand that the kids who are now predominantly the ones looking for work are the ones who did leave school early. If you want to challenge the assumption that the incentives make a difference in that respect, then you give me the evidence that says your view is correct, because I do not believe you can do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you may be happy to have a situation where a government expresses complete indifference as to what young Australians do&mdash;where a government is indifferent as to whether someone goes on into vocational training or not and  indifferent as to whether they leave school at the earliest possible age. We are not indifferent to that. We want to ensure that young Australians understand that our strong preference is for them to stay at school until year 12 and then do some vocational training or go to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You raised the question of whether students might leave for other than financial incentives, and you raised, for example, failure. This brings us back to the very point that I raised with you last week: the incapacity of some schools to fashion themselves for all young Australians and the disgraceful situa

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you are asking if I think schools around Australia are properly addressing the needs of the 75 per cent of students who will not go to university, clearly the answer is, no, they are not addressing the needs of those students as well as they should be. With this incentive there for kids to stay until year 12, schools will have to readdress their priorities and understand they are not simply a grooming place for those who go on to higher education and university; they are there to prepare all students to have an active and useful purpose in their life and for all students to raise themselves to their full potential.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister representing the Minister for Finance to questions without notice asked by Senators Faulkner, Mackay and Lundy today, relating to information technology outsourcing proposals of the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have seen through question time today a very grudging confirmation from the Minister representing the Minister for Finance (Senator Kemp) about part of a very sorry tale which has emerged from the estimates committees over the past few weeks. It really is a tale of sloppy decision making, of careless manage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4855"> ment of public funds. It is really more appropriate to the corporate cowboy era of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important at the outset of this important debate to lay the facts on the table about what has occurred. In February 1997, the Department of Veterans' Affairs let IT outsourcing to ISSC, which is a consortium headed by IBM. The contract was worth $65 million. On 6 March this year, ISSC&mdash;unsolicited&mdash;approached the Department of Finance and proposed that the department piggyback on the DVA contract and that Finance outsource its IT requirements using the expansion provisions of the DVA contract. On 18 March this year, there was advice to the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). We found out that there was no written record of the 6 March meeting. There was no proposal in writing from ISSC. Shortly after 18 March, Minister Fahey gave his approval for continued contact with ISSC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 24 March 1997, a meeting initiated by DOF&mdash;involving DOF, OGIT and DVA&mdash;was held on the piggyback proposal. This was the first occasion on which the proposal was discussed with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In fact, when the Department of Veterans' Affairs first heard about ISSC's unsolicited approach, they asked them to stop. On 15 April there was a meeting of the DOF management board, which formally agreed to continued negotiations with ISSC. On 24 April, the minister gave directions concerning procurement. On 25 April, the Minister for Finance issued a press release called `Outsourcing of Finance IT infrastructure', referring to generating competition through multiple tenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 May, there was the first written communication from ISSC to DOF on the piggyback proposal. That was eight days after the minister had given his direction. They received written communication from ISSC eight days after his direction. At the beginning of May, of course, the Minister for Finance made a decision that, after Finance, no further piggybacking would be allowed. What a sorry tale this is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Officials have revealed at estimates hearings that at no time was it made clear to com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> panies who expressed an interest in bidding for the original DVA contract that the possibility existed for another department to be shoehorned into that contract. Apparently ISSC, alone among the potential bidders, sussed out the opportunity to grab the Department of Finance contract without any further competitive tendering at all. Without a second thought, without even consulting the Department of Veterans' Affairs, we had a situation where Finance and OGIT went straight to Minister Fahey with a recommendation that negotiations commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did Mr Fahey ask any questions? No, not at all. Did Mr Fahey insist on seeking a formal written proposal from ISSC? No, he did not. No, he could hardly wait to give this proposition the tick. Forget about the other companies who might be better placed to bid for this business, and forget about the substantial differences between DOF's processing and DVA's. What matters to the government is to outsource, downsize, contract out, cut back&mdash;and to do it as quickly as possible and at any cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say enough is enough. This proposal has been shonky from the start. It is not enough to say, `There will be no more piggybacking after Finance piggybacks on DVA.' There are many defects in this scheme, which have been acknowledged by the minister, grudgingly and tardily, in prescribing the piggyback practice. In our view, the minister should admit that this has been a shonk from the start and call a halt now to any further negotiations. I call on him to do that, and I call on the Auditor-General to be invited to investigate this incredible mess and to report to parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy President, Senator Faulkner raises the issue of the Department of Veterans' Affairs contract and suggests that it was a shonky deal. Can I just reaffirm to you that, with the issue relating to piggybacking, the approach to the department by ISSC to join the outsourcing contract with the Department of Veterans' Affairs was unsolicited. The Department of Finance's approach 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is consistent with the overall strategy for whole of government IT infrastructure outsourcing using the purchasing guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This option is merely being explored. The outcome is not a foregone conclusion and it remains subject to the demonstration of value for money. Making the process of negotiations, as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) is trying to suggest, with the ISSC subject to ministerial direction before commencing negotiations was appropriate given the size of the project and the broader policy context of the whole of government IT outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the issue of the other tenderers' awareness of the capacity to piggyback. The purchasing guidelines issued by DAS allow for piggybacking, that is, the utilisation of an open tender conducted by another agency, rather than pursue a separate open tender, if there is a similarity of requirement. The Department of Veterans' Affairs contract and the request for tender included provision for significant growth for work load volumes&mdash;100 per cent growth in the services covered by the contract within the existing pricing structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you that some of the issues that were raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article that has been referred to are an attack on the ethics of Finance officials; they are regrettable and they are without any foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did indeed ask a lot of questions, and we did not get any answers. In fact I will come to some of the answers that we got a bit later on. Let me actually read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  article that has been referred to, because I think it pretty much epitomises the performance of the minister opposite with regard to these estimates. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crass performance of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp, before the Senate hearings has enhanced his reputation as one of the Opposition's greatest assets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is certainly one of our greatest assets and he is one of the coalition's biggest liabilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the kinds of responses that we got when we raised some of these questions at the estimates hearings. I have got to say that it was the greatest show in town. It was an absolute joke. Senator Lundy asked a question about what the definition of `phased' was. For the Senate's illumination, there are two things we are talking about here. `Clean break' is when you actually pay people out; when you pay them what they are due, when you give them a redundancy payment; when you actually pay them out in relation to superannuation. `Phased' is a euphemism for basically doing over workers, transferring them from the public sector to the private sector with a subsequent diminution of benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as for the costings, which we received after quite a bit of a hoo&hyphen;ha&mdash;and I might go into that a bit later if I have time&mdash;we were told that the savings the government projected as a result of this IT outsourcing initiative were close to a billion dollars. That was in the estimates, in the PBS. We asked how these calculations were determined. It was by the phased approach, apparently, we were told. We got that after adjourning the committee and emissaries were sent to the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to establish whether it was okay to tell the Senate estimates committee how calculations that are publicly available were determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we asked OGIT, `What is the definition of "phased"?' The response was: `We can't tell you that, Senator. That is cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.' So they had no definition of the methodology which was used to determine a financial saving of close to a billion dollars. They could not tell us what the definition of `phased' was, but Minister Fahey got up in the House of Representatives and said, `This is a fantastic initiative. This is going to save the government $1 billion.' But they could not even define what `phased' was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that; the approach that they are talking about was based on a model that was used in two hospitals at DVA and then extrapolated across the whole public sector. That is how they came up with the figure of a $960 million saving. What a joke! This whole thing has been a joke from beginning to end.

As my colleague Senator Ferguson and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) said earlier, the previous government had committed itself to IT outsourcing. The Department of Veterans' Affairs are a classic example of that; their Ferntree contract went from 1992 through until this year, and has, in fact, been very successful and has saved money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been successful. The new government decided to do further outsourcing with OGIT overseeing the whole issue. The government has decided on a policy of clustering its IT work&mdash;in other words, several departments together. That is government policy and what is going on now is a pilot in this direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government went out and got a request for tender from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. All the tenderers knew, as my colleague Senator Ferguson said, that it was government policy to piggyback on open tenders. Everyone knew about that. All the tenderers also knew that the demands of the Department of Veterans' Affairs on IT were going down, not up, and that the contract was for an overrun of 100 per cent of the requirements of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. So there was a lot of room for the government to put an additional part in the cluster. That is exactly what happened. The tenderers knew that that was a possibility and that, in fact, is what happened.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Finance made the decision that they would make use of that opportunity&mdash;it also fitted into a time slot between the two lots of budget work&mdash;to go ahead quickly to use the existing contract to achieve the savings earlier than otherwise would have been available. That is basically what has happened. The Australian government is saving money in this process. It has been through proper process and OGIT supported this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at a pilot of clustering of IT outsourcing. That is what it has really been about. It has been only a small part of the eventual program by the Commonwealth government. To put it into context, we have had this small outsourcing contract by the Department of Veterans' Affairs deliberately designed to bring others in with it&mdash;an additional 100 per cent work. When the tenderers knew that the Department of Veterans' Affairs workload was going down, the Department of Finance requested and got agreement to come in and use that overrun, which was in the open contract, to bring about substantial savings within the Department of Finance earlier than otherwise would have been available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what happened. We applaud that happening and we are looking forward to additional outsourcing of IT by the government. They have headed off in the right direction and their policy of cluster work for IT outsourcing is the right way to go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to address the issue of IT outsourcing in government. Before I make some comments in that regard, I would like to note how poorly Senator Gibson has been briefed on this issue. He has made a series of statements today with respect to the actual plan and agenda of OGIT and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). Many of the statements he has made have been contradicted explicitly by officers of the department throughout the Senate estimates process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than go over the ground that both Senator Faulkner and Senator Mackay have covered this afternoon in taking note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), I would like to turn to yet 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4859"> another perspective of this particular debacle, this shonky practice, that is worthy of exploring. I would like to turn specifically to the Commonwealth procurement guidelines to which the minister referred in his reply and to which Senator Gibson also referred as being applied as some justification for the process that the Department of Finance has embarked upon in the piggybacking of their IT contract on that of DVA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to Senator Gibson's statements and to statements by the minister, there was no explicit clause in the contract with respect to DVA and there certainly was no industry understanding that that contract could be piggybacked. Yes, the minister has been correct throughout the estimates process when it was said that it was not specifically precluded, but nowhere did the DVA contract outline or identify the ability for that contract to be extended beyond that particular department, the DVA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has not only been challenged by industry but it has, in fact, solicited a suitable response from OGIT and the department, albeit a belated one. Andy Macdonald, the head of the Office of Government Information Technology, in response to a question from me at estimates, actually said that they will not be proceeding. I will read out the question and the response to get it into context. My question to Mr Macdonald was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you are saying is that it was sort of like an unintended consequence of the first stage of IT outsourcing and that the reaction from industry, I would contend, was a bit more than `That's okay' and `It was a good idea' a couple of days down the track. At least that is worthy of some acknowledgment, if not by OGIT, then perhaps Senator Kemp, by the minister&mdash;that due process was not proceeded with in accordance, certainly, with the strategy that OGIT had in mind and that in fact goes some way to devaluing or undermining the integrity of the OGIT strategy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Macdonald's response was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think I would be prepared to go that far. As I said earlier, we did not anticipate early joining of clusters, but when the proposition was made we looked at it and on balance we felt that it was legal to do so. It provided an early start, as I indicated earlier. It provided leadership. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to make a few other comments with respect to getting the process going and responding to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point here is that the justification for the Department of Finance proceeding in this way is based on a very loose interpretation and reference to the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. But the procurement guidelines that have been quoted consistently by Senator Kemp in estimates, and by Minister Fahey, are not specific. All that they provide is a discretionary clause in section 4. Quite succinctly, 4.4 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exercising discretion in deciding the procurement method.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth does not prescribe the procurement method to be used, nor does it set minimum limits on the number of offers to be sought. Requirements and market conditions vary, and the person responsible for deciding how supplies are to be procured must consider each case on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the discretionary clause that the Department of Finance have used to piggyback their IT contract on the back of DVA. There is nothing else in the procurement guidelines which provides for it. But, if you take it all in context, that particular provision must also have a direct relationship with Finance regulation 43(1) which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`A person who decides how supplies are to be procured must choose methods that will promote open and effective competition to the extent practicable.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It lists a number of examples, including advertising publicly and giving all that have the opportunity to tender the right to do so and the opportunity to do so. This has not been done in this case. It is a shonky process.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that one needs to ask today is this: why has this question not been asked of Mr Fahey, the Minister for Finance, in the lower house? Why have those opposite not been game enough to go into the lower house and ask Mr Fahey the question? They have had ample opportunity. These questions were asked in estimates some weeks ago. There has been question time after question time, but no, they have not gone in and asked Mr Fahey. They have fiddled around here asking questions; they have spent hours in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4860"> estimates asking questions. Today Senator Lundy commented, when she was describing the clause in the procurement guidelines, `That's the clause they've used to piggyback tender.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ferguson said, and I will now say it again just to make sure they hear: the tender has not been let; the tender has not been finalised; the outcome is not a foregone conclusion. Contrary to what the opposition has said, it is not a foregone conclusion. From the way they have come in here today, you would think that the deal had been done, that it had been signed and sealed, but that is not the case. What has happened is that there has been an exploration of the possibility of piggybacking the Department of Finance's IT outsourcing with DVA's outsourcing. But that has not been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did I hear anybody on the other side of the chamber come in and ask questions about the letting of tenders? When I pursued the letting of a tender for a $5 million contract with a company that was balance sheet insolvent at the time that the then government let a contract to them, I did not hear any of these people bleating then about the contract being wrong and unfair or why was a Dun and Bradstreet check not done to make sure the company was able to carry out the contract. What happened in that case? The company went bankrupt in the middle of the contract. Not one question, not one dorothy dixer did we get about that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we come in here with a potential situation&mdash;not even something that has actually happened&mdash;and those opposite waste hours in estimates and spend time in the chamber, not asking the question of the minister directly but asking the minister assisting him, over and over again, when it is not even a foregone conclusion. Talk about a storm in a teacup and making up something that does not really exist! I think that they ought to focus on more definite things. If in fact this contract had been signed, if the deal had been done, then yes, maybe they could have come in and asked some questions, but it has not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been done; it is being looked at. And it is within the procurement guidelines; it is legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those opposite do not like the idea of outsourcing; most probably that is the problem. When you look at what happens with outsourcing in the private sector&mdash;at companies such as the Macquarie Bank, Qantas, AMP, Integral Energy and, I think, the Commonwealth Bank which shortly is going to outsource its IT&mdash;you can see that they have outsourced their IT to obtain better value and to give them greater access to new technology. For example, AMP, which outsourced in 1993, in 1996 said publicly that the savings it has won have vindicated the process and have proved positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the public sector in Victoria, at least seven government agencies have outsourced. These include the State Revenue Office, which expects to save up to 15 per cent over the five years of the contract, and Vicroads, which expects to save $10 million over the same period. In Western Australia a cluster of four agencies, including the Department of Main Roads and the Water Corporation, have outsourced and are saving themselves 20 per cent per year in reduced IT costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here is clustering the outsourcing to try and gain the benefit of any excesses built into any contract. There was excess in the DVA contract, and that was what was being examined to see if the Department of Finance could piggyback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In criticising outsourcing, Labor is forgetting their own outsourcing deal regarding Veterans' Affairs when a projected $10 million was to be saved over a five&hyphen;year contract. A new improved contract has been projected to save in excess of 20 per cent. That was announced earlier this year by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott. What we are seeing here is Labor making a mountain out of a molehill over an issue which has not been decided. And that ought to be absolutely clear: it is something that is being explored; it has not been decided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite ought to look at issues that really matter. They ought to say, `Look at the things that have happened; we have had savings.' But they are not interested in that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4861"> They are interested in running down burrows, chasing rabbits and looking for things that have not actually happened. Talk about paranoia!

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently there has been considerable discussion in Australia about the role and actions of the Courts and the judiciary. At the Federal level this discussion has included aspects of the doctrine of the separation of powers, of the independence of the judiciary and of public statements by judges on matters of present political controversy. It is, however, perhaps less well known that Federal judges also make legislation, with enabling Acts providing for the judges of the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court and, at least until recently, the Industrial Relations Court, to make rules of Court for these respective Courts. These rules are subject to tabling and disallowance and, like all disallowable instruments, are scrutinised by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to ensure that they comply with its high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. This obligation is contained in the terms of reference given to the Committee by the Senate in 1932 and amended in 1979 to take into account 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4869"> the creation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate will recall that the Committee's 101st Report, tabled on 8 June 1995, reported on action by the Committee in respect of the principal Industrial Relations Court Rules, Statutory Rules 1994 No 110, which were not gazetted until more than five weeks after they were expressed to come into operation and which therefore appeared to be void for prejudicial retrospectivity. After some discussion the Acting Chief Justice advised that, to avoid doubt, the Rules would be repealed and re&hyphen;made in order to operate with unambiguous validity. This was subsequently done, with the exception of one provision which everyone seemed to agree was void. This action could not validate the earlier Rules but would at least ensure that the re&hyphen;made Rules were valid. Two years later two sets of amending Rules were not tabled within the statutory period and subsequently ceased to have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Committee is scrutinising the High Court Rules (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No 11, which amend the amounts of costs which solicitors who are entitled to practise in the High Court may charge. The Committee was concerned about a number of apparent defects in the Rules and wrote to the Chief Justice. Firstly, the Rules included a number of Notes. Notes included in Commonwealth legislation are usually regarded as illustrative or informative and not part of the legislation itself. These Notes, however, appeared to intend to provide for matters which would normally be included in substantive Rules. Furthermore, the Notes were drafted in a hybrid style which was neither legislation nor information. Moreover, one Note gave the Taxing Officer putative unlimited discretion to override amounts in some items of costs but a discretion up to a limit for other costs and no discretion at all in respect of other costs. Additionally, the Rules provided for witnesses called because of their professional, scientific or other skills or knowledge to be paid $610 a day in addition to lost earnings while other witnesses are paid only $64 a day in addition to lost earnings. This appeared most unfair. Finally, the Rules included gender specific language although for more than a decade this has not been Commonwealth legislative drafting practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Registrar of the High Court replied to our letter advising that the Notes were in fact intended to have substantive effect. This was unexpected advice because, as outlined earlier, this would not usually be the case in Commonwealth legislation which, of course, includes the Rules of the High Court. The Registrar also confirmed our understanding of the Taxing Officer's discretions. The Registrar justified the tenfold difference in costs between what he referred to as "professional" witnesses and, in his words, "ordinary" witnesses, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by advising that witnesses rarely appeared before the High Court. Finally, the Registrar advised that the gender specific language would be redressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was not satisfied with the reply and wrote again to the Chief Justice, advising that it prefers that its letters are answered by those to whom they are addressed, although the Committee was grateful to the Registrar for his reply. The Committee asked for further advice on the intention and effect of the Notes, suggesting that if it was wished to provided for the matters in the Notes as legislation, that it may be appropriate to draft and number the provisions in accordance with conventional legislative drafting practice. The Committee also asked about the reasons for the different discretions given to the Taxing Officer and about the apparently unfair provisions for costs of witnesses. The Committee advised the Chief Justice that, in order to preserve its options, the Committee had given a protective notice of disallowance of the Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's letter was again answered by the Registrar, despite the Committee indicating that it would prefer to have its letters answered by the Chief Justice, because the enabling Act provides for the judges of the High Court, rather than the administrative staff, to make the Rules. The Committee was surprised by this, although we quite understand that the Chief Justice would wish to distance himself from the matters which the Committee raised. The reply was, however, positive in that it advised that a present review would most likely recommend a complete revision of the relevant parts of the Rules which would take into account the Committee's concerns about drafting style. On behalf of the Committee I will be writing to the Chief Justice for the third time about other aspects of the Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 presently before the Senate provides that the Principal Legislative Counsel may provide assistance in drafting Rules of Court if the relevant Chief Justice seeks it. These provisions are appropriate. In the meantime the Committee understands that no statutory provision is needed for the Office of Legislative Drafting to assist the judges when they legislate. For instance, during the scrutiny of the Industrial Relations Court Rules the Acting Chief Justice of that Court advised the Committee that officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department had offered to assist the Court to re&hyphen;make the Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scrutiny by the Committee of the present High Court Rules and the earlier scrutiny of the Industrial Relations Court Rules illustrate the need for supervision by the Committee, on behalf of the Senate, of delegated legislation made by judges. In these cases the Rules did not comply with the standards which the Senate could reasonably expect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4870"> and action by the Committee has at least partly alleviated the situation. In this context any discussion of the separation of powers usually includes reference to the related doctrine of checks and balances between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. Here it is clear that it was useful and appropriate for the Parliament, which in practice means the Senate, to provide a check and a balance for the High Court judges in their formal legislative role.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4870"><TITLE>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="4870"><TITLE>Statement</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 November 1996 I reported to the Senate on behalf of the Committee about its scrutiny of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which will make numbers of changes to the ability of Parliament to scrutinise and, if the Senate wishes, ultimately to disallow legislative instruments. I reported that, following considerable correspondence with Ministers, several meetings with the Attorney&hyphen;General and government amendments of the Bill in the House of Representatives, the Committee supported the Bill, subject to a number of important exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has continued its correspondence with Ministers, sending or receiving a further 14 letters on this matter since I last reported to the Senate, with more which I intend to send shortly. Unfortunately three of the four major defects in the Bill still remain, with the responsible Ministers advising the Committee that they will not sponsor government amendments to remedy them. The first defect is a provision for the Attorney&hyphen;General to issue conclusive certificates that an instrument is or is not legislative. These certificates would be unreviewable on their merits and not disallowable. The Attorney&hyphen;General had argued that such certificates are not legislative in character, but are merely opinions. If that is the case the Senate should have the capacity to express a contrary opinion, and hence such certificates should be disallowable. The second defect is that the Bill excludes instruments providing for national schemes of legislation from parliamentary disallowance. The third defect is that the Bill excludes quarantine proclamations from disallowance, even though breaches of these proclamations incur penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fourth defect related to instruments made in respect of Commonwealth employment. There was some progress in this area, with the Minister undertaking that government amendments would address some of the Committee's concerns although, as I will discuss later, problems remain in one important area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government amendments of the Bill as before the Senate have now been drafted. The Committee wrote to the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon Daryl Williams, as soon as the amendments were prepared, asking for a copy. The Attorney responded at once, in the helpful manner which, as I have reported previously to the Senate, has assisted the Committee in its deliberations on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government amendments are relatively brief and are mainly of a type which would not attract the concerns of the Committee. There are, however, two defective aspects of the amendments which the Committee wishes to draw to the attention of the Senate, both of which dilute the scheme of the Bill in relation to parliamentary control of legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first problem is that the Bill exempts from disallowance all legislative instruments (apart from regulations) made under the key parts of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act 1958 </EMPHASIS> dealing with the control of the arrival and presence of non&hyphen;citizens and with important aspects of the administration of that Act. It is fair to say that without the parts which are exempted the Migration Act would be effectively inoperative. The exempt control parts, for instance, deal with immigration status, unlawful non&hyphen;citizens, visas, the "points" system, immigration clearances, search and detention, detention centres and deportations. The exempt administration parts include, among other things, obstructing persons administering the Act, tampering with movements records, offences in relation to escaping from custody, commencement of prosecutions, jurisdictions of courts and review of decisions. In addition, there are numbers of exempt administrative matters which deserve special mention. These include provisions under which the Minister may give general policy directions, exercise a "special" power to refuse or to cancel a visa or to declare a person to be an excluded person. These matters, of course, include the most sensitive areas of immigration and many of them affect personal rights of the most basic kinds. Under the government amendments any legislative instruments made under these provisions will not be subject to parliamentary control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments made under parts of the Migration Regulations will also be exempt from parliamentary disallowance. The Migration Regulations are actually much longer than the Migration Act and include exempt provisions relating to, among other things, adoption, criminal detention, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4871"> domestic violence, visa cancellation and giving medical treatment by force to a person in detention. Here again these provisions affect basic personal rights and legislative instruments made under them will not be disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee draws the attention of the Senate to these exemptions relating to migration as a further instance of the dilution of a fundamental principle of the Bill that Parliament should have full control over legislative instruments. In this context the Committee recalls that on 20 September 1990 the then Deputy Chairman, Senator Bronwyn Bishop, made a statement to the Senate on behalf of the Committee on quasi&hyphen;legislation, tabling the Procedures Advice Manual of the then Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The Manual was, or perhaps still is, the quasi&hyphen;legislation used to administer the Act and the Regulations on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. The Manual consisted of 195 booklets of some 3,300 pages in total, as amended by 41 policy control instructions. The cost of the complete Manual was about $300, with special folders to keep the booklets, which could be bought separately, costing another $100. Much of the Manual or its present day equivalent would be genuinely administrative  in nature and thus not appropriate for parliamentary disallowance. On the other hand, however, it seems that portions of it would come within the definition of legislative instrument in the Bill. As such these will be subject to all of the procedural safeguards of the Bill, including registration and tabling, except for disallowance.  The Committee suggests that there may be a case for providing for disallowance as an additional parliamentary safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other aspect of the government amendments which the Committee draws to the attention of the Senate is the effect of proposed changes to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Act 1903</EMPHASIS> , the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Service Act 1922 </EMPHASIS> and the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. </EMPHASIS> The provisions affected deal with remuneration and conditions of service of, respectively, members of the Australian Defence Force, of the Australian Public Service and of the holders of public office, including among others judges, permanent heads of departments and members of statutory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of the Defence Act and the Public Service Act appear to provide for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny and control of determinations affecting members of the ADF and the APS, which will be deemed to be disallowable non&hyphen;legislative instruments. The Committee would prefer that these be brought under the general umbrella of the Bill, but the provisions do recognise the rights of Parliament. Indeed, the existing safeguards are improved by requiring determinations to be tabled within six days, instead of the present 15 days, of making. They also provide for the Senate to defer disallowance for six months. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does, however, have concerns about proposed government amendments to the Bill which will affect the Remuneration Tribunal Act. The proposed amendments to that Act implement long&hyphen;standing undertakings given to the Committee by successive Ministers that a defect in the Act would be corrected. The defect is that there is no time limit in respect of a requirement that the Tribunal give a copy of each determination to the Minister, following which the Minister must table the disallowable determination.  These undertakings followed the discovery by the Committee that in one case the Tribunal had waited for nine months before giving a determination to the Minister. The government amendments require the Tribunal to give a determination to the Minister within seven days of making.  This amendment is appropriate. Unfortunately, there are other significant defects in the Remuneration Tribunal Act, which are not addressed by the amendments and which mean that Tribunal determinations are subject to less effective parliamentary scrutiny than legislative instruments subject to the Bill or disallowable non&hyphen;legislative instruments. The Remuneration Tribunal Act still only requires tabling within 15 sitting days of receipt by the Minister, rather than the new standard of six sitting days. More importantly, that Act still requires that any disallowance must take place within 15 sitting days of tabling, rather than the established time, recognised in the Bill, of within 15 sitting days after notice which may itself be given 15 sitting days after tabling. The Bill also provides for a House to defer consideration of a disallowance motion for up to six months, which will not be an option in respect of Tribunal determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote earlier to the Minister about these defects and we have now received a reply. In his reply the Minister advised the Committee that it would be "unfair", to use the Minister's expression, for the judges, permanent heads of government departments and others affected by the Tribunal determinations, to be subject to the "uncertainty" associated with the extension of parliamentary scrutiny of "such significant remuneration outcomes". At the same time the government amendments affecting our ordinary servicemen and women and lower level public servants extend their present "uncertainty" by up to six months while shortening the onset of the uncertainty from a possible 15 sitting days to a possible six sitting days. In other words, the Minister has advised that it would be unfair for those to whom the Minister refers as "the most senior office&hyphen;holders in the Commonwealth sector" to be subject to greater scrutiny of their remuneration, while it is apparently acceptable and even desirable for the same amendments to provide for additional parliamentary oversight of the remuneration of the lower levels of Commonwealth employment. The Com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4872"> mittee was surprised by this advice, which on its face appears to breach principles of equity and fairness and to fly in the face of Australian egalitarian traditions. On behalf of the Committee I will write to the Minister asking for a detailed explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime the Committee draws to the attention of the Senate the government amendments to the Bill affecting instruments made under the Migration Act and Remuneration Tribunal Act as two more instances where the principles of the Bill are diluted and Parliament is denied its proper scrutiny role.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4872"><TITLE>Treaties Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="4872"><TITLE>Report</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled includes two chapters on treaties tabled on 18 March and 13 May 1997, together with a progress report on the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. This is the eighth report the Committee has tabled since September last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treaties considered in the first two chapters are routine, but mention should be made of the agreement with New Zealand about the Joint Accreditation System we have with that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Agreement deals with a body which was established to meet the demand for an accreditation system for providers of quality management systems and product certification services. The objective behind this accreditation system is the attainment of national and international recognition of Australian and New Zealand producers, auditors, consultants and trainers functioning within conformity assessment structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were concerned that the system does not include a formal review mechanism to evaluate the success of its efforts to enhance exports. We have therefore recommended that such a formal mechanism be established. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since beginning the inquiry into the Desertification Convention, we have held three public hearings and one inspection. Honourable Senators will perhaps recall that this Convention has been the subject of some controversy, and that Australia has not yet ratified it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not yet tabled a National Interest Analysis (NIA) on this Convention. We understand that further consultation is required with the States and Territories and with other interested organisations before an NIA can be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that, in this situation, there is no alternative for us than to keep the situation under review and to reopen the inquiry when and if an NIA becomes available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to mention another matter briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent speech, the Attorney-General referred to last year's reforms ensuring Parliament had a `well-defined and effective role' in the treaty-making process. He was also kind enough to refer to the `pro-active manner' in which this Committee has carried out its role in the new process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our First Report was tabled on 9 September 1996 and the Government Response was tabled on 14 May 1997. To date, the Government has not responded to the remaining six reports, although we understand two other responses will be tabled tomorrow. Nevertheless, the Committee is disappointed at this relatively slow rate of response.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CGT exemption: disposal of small business assets on retirement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill implements the Government's election commitment to allow small business taxpayers to claim an exemption from tax on capital gains made on the disposal of some or all of their active business assets if the proceeds are used for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CGT retirement exemption will be welcomed by thousands of small business operators. Owners of small businesses often need to reinvest earnings into their business to sustain growth and increase profitability. These individuals are sometimes not financially able to contribute to superannuation on a regular or even occasional basis. This measure offers a way in which those individuals can place 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accumulated capital gains into the superannuation environment without making regular contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers eligible for the CGT retirement exemption are individuals conducting business as sole traders or in partnership, and companies and trusts where there is a controlling individual who is also an employee of the company or trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principal residence exemption from CGT</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer, in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, announced measures to extend the principal residence exemption to assist homeowners, and beneficiaries and trustees of deceased estates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the qualifying period for the capital gains tax (CGT) exemption on disposal of an inherited house from 12 months to 2 years. This will assist many trustees and beneficiaries of deceased estates by giving them more time to dispose of the deceased's principal residence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide a partial CGT exemption for trustees and beneficiaries of deceased estates where the deceased never used the dwelling as a principal residence but beneficiaries of the estate do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions will also treat a beneficiary or trustee who acquires a dwelling as a result of a death as having acquired the dwelling at its market value on the date of death if it was wholly the principal residence of the deceased at the time of death. Also, where a person's principal residence is first used for income producing purposes, its market value at that date will be used as its cost base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments recognise that taxpayers often experience record keeping and compliance problems when disposing of a dwelling that has been used for income producing purposes either for part of the period of ownership or during a period prior to inheritance. The amendments will ensure that taxpayers do not need to keep records of costs incurred before a principal residence is first used for income producing purposes or inherited by them. This will simplify the tax treatment in the majority of cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Subsidiary company liquidations and capital gains tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the capital gains tax provisions of the act to reduce a capital gain or loss otherwise realised on the cancellation of shares on the dissolution of a company which is the wholly owned subsidiary of another company. The provisions apply where consideration for the disposal of the shares is equal to the market value of assets distributed in specie to the shareholder company by the liquidator as part of a final distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will ensure that duplication of gains or losses will be avoided as far as possible in these cases.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gains and losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes several amendments to the income tax law in relation to capital and revenue losses. These measures were announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments include provisions relating to the offset of current year capital losses, the correction of anomalies in the loss and bad debt provisions relating to companies, the insertion safeguards in the same business test contained in the capital loss provisions, and the tax treatment of payments made in consideration for the transfer of capital and revenue losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these previously announced amendments, the bill proposes to amend the capital loss transfer provisions to give the Commissioner of Taxation unlimited time to amend the assessment of a transferee company in certain circumstances. The Commissioner already has this power in relation to the analogous revenue loss transfer provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Depreciation of lessor's fixtures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another measure in the bill will ensure that a lessor of depreciable plant or articles under a chattel lease is treated as the owner for taxation depreciation purposes where that leased equipment has become a fixture on another person's land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, only the owner of the land is the owner of any fixtures on the land, including plant and equipment that may be leased. Technically, that means a lessor may not be entitled to depreciation in respect of leased plant that becomes a fixture on another person's land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will result in a more consistent treatment of taxation depreciation allowances for capital expenditure on leased plant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Treatment of payments made under the firearms surrender arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will implement the announcement made by the Treasurer on 24 July 1996 concerning the tax treatment of payments made under the Compensation for the Surrender of Prohibited Firearms Guidelines issued by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. These guidelines were issued as a result of the meeting of State and Territory Police Ministers regarding uniform gun laws held on 10 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will ensure that no income or capital gains tax will be paid in respect of the compensation payments received under the arrangements by taxpayers who are not gun dealers and who used prohibited firearms either in their business or for private purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will provide two outcomes for gun dealers . They will ensure that there will be no taxable income in relation to a prohibited firearm during the income years when it was held as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trading stock. They will also exempt from tax compensation payments received for the loss of business caused by the prohibition of certain firearms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 December 1996, the Treasurer announced that the Government would move amendments to the R&amp;D tax concession to ensure that companies in partnership could not recreate undesirable syndicate like features.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, the bill ensures that limits on core technology deductions that came into effect on 23 July 1996 will apply to companies in partnership in the same way as to other companies. One of the worst aspects of syndicated R&amp;D related to the immediate deduction of expenditure on overvalued core technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also authorises disallowance of deductions of R&amp;D syndicates, where an extension of the syndication period has been granted but the syndicate has breached a condition of that extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the bill makes minor corrective measures which ensure that amendments to the R&amp;D provisions made by Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 3) 1996 apply as intended.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill implements the Government's election commitment to provide a rebate to a person who contributes to superannuation on behalf of a low&hyphen;income or non&hyphen;working spouse. To be eligible for the rebate, the spouse's assessable income must be less than $13,800.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate is calculated as 18 per cent of contributions up to a maximum of $3,000 in contributions. This limit is reduced where the spouse's assessable income exceeds $10,800.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend some aspects of the taxation laws in relation to family tax assistance. The changes are technical in nature, to ensure that family tax assistance is properly delivered to the people who are intended to benefit from the measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will correct some anomalies in the way the law currently works. Firstly, taxpayers with primary production income and a special income component, such as a capital gain, will be able to reduce the rate of complementary tax (if any) by an amount representing family tax assistance, in circumstances where family tax assistance benefits exceed the ordinary tax liability. This will put these taxpayers in the same position as other taxpayers who are liable to pay complementary tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, in the existing law, entitlement to family tax assistance increases the rate of further tax on uncontrolled partnership income. The law will be amended to ensure this is no longer the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the complementary tax provisions in relation to family tax assistance will be adjusted for taxpayers with reduced tax&hyphen;free thresholds (such as new residents and full&hyphen;time students entering the work force for the first time).

The legislation is due to be debated&mdash;and it will be because the Greens do not have the numbers in here&mdash;this afternoon. It is a matter that requires a lot of deliberation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In November last year, the opposition in fact established a Senate references inquiry into the Brew report and the future role of the Commonwealth in the rail industry in Australia. The major findings of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which were tabled in May this year, were that while the Brew report provided an adequate analysis of the financial position of individual AN business units that by itself does not provide a proper framework for the development of rail policy. I must say that Mr Brew made it very clear, in evidence that he gave to the committee, that he did not presume that it did. He said a number of times in evidence to the committee that his job was to simply assess what AN's financial position was and to develop options fundamentally for selling it up. He did not have a brief for advising the government on any kind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of coherent rail policy for Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Senate committee came to the conclusion that the November 1996 rail package contained very little new funding for the rail industry. In fact, the government's rail reform package of 24 November provided virtually no new money for the Australian rail industry despite the minister's claim that the package was a $2 billion reform measure. Other than the $112 million for redundancies and $20 million for regional adjustment, the remainder of the package was either for existing Commonwealth liabilities or, in the case of the track authority, money already budgeted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee found that the Commonwealth had not provided any adequate funding for track upgrading, will minimise the value of assets realised at the sale and will run down the value of the Commonwealth's rail assets. The Senate committee also found that NR should not be sold, in any event, prior to the expiration of the NR agreement in 1999 and that before proceeding with the sale process the Commonwealth should develop a coherent land transport policy framework taking into account financial, economic, social and environmental goals and providing medium&hyphen; and long&hyphen;term road and rail investment programs in all major corridors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 13 May budget saw a further cut of $80 million over four years to the budget of the proposed track authority. The Senate committee heard a significant body of evidence that the pre&hyphen;budget allocation would be inadequate for the purposes of providing Australia with a decent interstate rail network. The coalition of course is now committed to the expenditure of $175 million for the track authority compared to the $370 million which was committed by the former Labor government. This shows their significant lack of commitment to this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns that the opposition had to this process were well and truly brought to the attention of the Senate committee in the public hearings that that committee held. As I said before, the principal objection that the opposition has to this legislation is that it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4878"> devoted principally to a sell up of the asset without any kind of coherent policy framework for the Commonwealth's future role in rail services in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I arrived in the Senate in 1993 I have been speaking about the importance of rail. It was in the fuel tax debate in October of that year that I outlined some of the reasons the Greens WA feel rail is important. They include the fact that per tonne of freight rail uses roughly one-third of the fuel used if that freight had been carried by road. Given the huge distances involved in transporting freight from the eastern states to Western Australia and even from Sydney to Melbourne or Brisbane, shifting long&hyphen;haul freight from road to rail would help our greenhouse record quite a bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, just shifting one&hyphen;quarter of the freight now travelling by road between Melbourne and Sydney onto rail freight services would reduce CO2 emissions for the transport sector by 10 per cent. It would cut it by 20 per cent if we could get half the road freight into rail. Not only that, by reducing emissions, we would reduce the estimated cost to Australia for air pollution from $787 million, according to the information I cited back in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would use a fraction of the space that roads do and dramatically reduce accidents. The train fatality rate is only 11 per cent that of trucks and we would avoid the stupidity of horrific accidents like the one a few years ago when a road train hauling grain had a brake 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4879"> failure coming down the hill into Perth from Mundaring and ran through a light and several cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course government seems set to go the other way. In the time since I initially quoted these figures, rail funding has declined. Rail services have been wound back. We have had massive campaigns on behalf of road funding like the infamous `fix Australia: fix the roads' campaign. We have seen the Premier of Western Australia approve bringing road trains right into the city limits of Perth. In Queensland, I now understand they are supporting road trains with three  trailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government raised the fuel taxes on rail in 1993 and then hit it with a massive increase from 6c to 32c&mdash;an increase for rail fuel of 26c per litre! The government claimed this was for environmental reasons, to prevent the use of dirtier fuel. The rail services use exactly the same fuel; it is just reclassified from fuel oil to diesel fuel. The fuel itself remains the same. In fact, the level of what is acceptable for sale as diesel has gone down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence is overwhelming that from an environmental standpoint it is preferable to have at least long&hyphen;haul freight go by rail. From a health standpoint it is better. From a land use standpoint it is better. From the standpoint of the amenity of towns, such as Northam, Southern Cross and so on, it is better. From the standpoint of savings on the cost of building and maintaining roads it is better. From the standpoint of paying for health services and paying for by-passes to get the stream of trucks off the main streets of small towns it is better. In almost every sensible, practical sense it is better to have at least long&hyphen;haul freight on rail instead of road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Short&hyphen;haul freight also has advantages. There is no reason not to have a good distribution system. Evidence from the rail industry is that the trunk routes operate much more profitably when they are fed and feed into a distributed regional rail network. In many, if not most, places where we can displace freight from road to rail the environment and community is the winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, in Western Australia we have logs and mineral sands going by road through all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the beautiful small towns in the south west&mdash;places people go to get away from traffic and from the bustle of the urban environment. In Bridgetown there is an incessant stream of log trucks. In towns like Bunbury we have mineral sands trucks driving through suburban streets, leaking radioactive sand that blows onto the verges and against the houses lining the roads. The routes can be traced by geiger counter. The union says that they should be travelling by covered railway cars. Why listen to the unions? Why think of health when there are a few cents to be made? The fact that there is a rail line nearby just makes the situation less comprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For shorter distances, particularly in more built&hyphen;up areas, the use of electric rail is practical and studies on passenger rail by the Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Murdoch University indicate the greenhouse emissions from electric rail are less per passenger kilometre than for either road or buses and substantially less when we talk about light rail systems. They also have the advantage of being quiet and keeping emissions at the power plant instead of in urban streets. They are currently using coal rather than scarce liquid fuel but they can be converted to renewably sourced electricity in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the problem is that we see roads as some sort of free good in our society. Rails cost money and the cost of maintaining a rail network is fairly easy to quantify and assign to the rail carrier. The cost of maintaining a road network, on the other hand, is seen as a social cost, something used by everyone&mdash;private cars, buses, business vehicles, trucks and road trains. It is used for many purposes: tourism, going to work, doing private business, going to parties, long distance transport, cruising through urban centres on weekend evenings, and haulage. We assign the cost of the rail system to the trains. We do not properly assign the cost of roads. We might be able to look at the money the Commonwealth puts in specifically for roads, but road funding comes from general transfers to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states spend money on roads, and local shires spend money on roads, and this in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4880"> cludes things like forced resumption of lands for highway building or upgrading. Then, there are the contingent costs such as the establishment and maintenance of a traffic network, the system of lights and signals. There is the cost of policing all those individuals making individual decisions. What percentage of police time is spent on traffic related duties? All that is part of the expense of roads. Of course, there are studies that have been done on this in other places. I know there have been studies in relation to Western Australia. I know there have been extensive studies in the United Kingdom and related areas. I am sure there have been studies in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many accidents are there? How many health related issues, lung problems, lead problems, problems with new additives like benzene and problems with ozone and photochemical smogs are there? What about the costs of establishing parking spaces, costs to business, costs to the texture of our city centres and costs in terms of creating urban deserts? All of these are costs of favouring roads over rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am left in a fairly invidious position. I firmly believe it is in the best interests of both people and the environment of Australia to actively pursue a strategy of support for rail as a transport form for freight and passengers, for urban and rural communities, for short&hyphen; and long&hyphen;distance transport. I think we need to move away from roads and cars. At the same time, I do not believe that the ALP in government was particularly supportive of rail. This government has a particular hatred for rail, eclipsed only by its hatred of anything to do with Australian national shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such a context, rail is always presented as an expense. Increasing capitalisation of rail by government is, these days, unthinkable. It is nearly impossible for rail interests within government to seem to have as much of a claim as the road lobby, so rail will always be under&hyphen;represented. People in the departments must feel it is almost a lost cause when they come to their minister and then to cabinet, if they do these days, with proposals for spending on rail.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, in the case where governments are not pulling their weight in relation to developing, creating and recapitalising rail, there might be people genuinely interested in rail and the prospect of reversing the decline of rail. There might be investors with a commitment to such a reversal where we could see potentially a reversal in the decline of rail use. It might be the case that rail could be better under a private sector, but you need to have, as Senator Collins suggested, some sort of policy. We have not seen that. We are being asked to sign a blank cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no guarantee that what we will get is a good bidder, one committed to an extensive and growing rail system. There is no guarantee that such a bidder will win. There was a suggestion at the time of privatisation in New Zealand that private rail interests should simply close down all the branch lines and stick to the backbone route. That is the kind of thing governments are doing. In this particular case, the buyers found that the backbone was fed by the branches and so they did not close them. But who is to say that that particular company is typical? In the United States, historically road, fuel and petroleum interests have purchased tram systems just to close them down. Those decisions are now being reversed, but we have no guarantee that a similar kind of thing will not happen here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to think of ways that we could encode an obligation on a buyer to keep branches open and services running to ensure that the rail network remains at least as extensive as it is now. We have tried to think of how we could put a requirement that the buyer work for an objective of displacing road freight into rail. We have tried to think of how we could guarantee passenger services are maintained and that road and rail container terminals are the world's best. We have tried to figure out a way to draft a requirement that the long distance passenger trains like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS> are maintained as affordable overland passenger trains and not just tourist attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time that we have had available in the context of this bill and the way the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4881"> government is breaking up parts of this system, to put such requirements into law would be extremely difficult. Unfortunately, it is proposed to sell Australian National piecemeal, with the biggest parts being the Tasmanian network and the South Australian network. We still do not even know what will happen with Track Australia. If and when it is properly established, it will probably be sold along with National Rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there might be little opposition in the long run for the sale of the railways. This decision should not be rushed. I will continue to say that the best thing would be for government to take a long-term view, a proactive position, and work to shift long haul freight to ship and rail. It would be very much in the interest of Australia in terms of reducing our vulnerability to oil price changes so we could not put our hands up bleatingly in the international arena and say, `Pity us. We're so vulnerable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the petroleum products that we all need to consume at the moment, we could reduce that dependence. We could reduce our greenhouse emissions and address the real problems facing the world, particularly the ones likely to impact on Australian agriculture and fisheries. We could reduce dependence in terms of working positively to create a world where the choice does not need to be car ownership or isolation and disempowerment. We could reduce dependence in terms of general health and amenity and the reduction of a myriad of external expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Brown has some amendments that he would like to put to this bill, but there is a proposal from the ALP that the bill is taken for further consideration and that we ask the government to look to see exactly what policy it is pursuing before rushing into this. I do understand the distress that is occurring within this industry in relation to decapitalisation, running down of capital, and the running down of the ability for rail freight and passenger rail to compete effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the distress that is occurring, but I also believe that we would not be acting responsibly as a Senate unless we had a bit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more information upon which to make a decision as to whether or not Australian National is to be privatised and on what basis Australian National is to be privatised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate opposition to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R217">Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997</XREF>  in its current form, and to make some comments in relation to it. First, there seems to be a trend in the pursuit of legislation by this government to leave a lot out of the bill and in the power of the executive. Senator Margetts, in effect, has touched upon that aspect of this bill in her indication of support for Labor's amendment on the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the debate on the Reform of Employment Services Bill, we have seen an indication that the government will use other legislation and executive power to implement its policy, if the bill is not passed in the form it desires. In relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill, we have seen legislation which goes far beyond the expressed intention of the government in relation to its policy on work for the dole. And, in this case, we see a bill which allows for the sale and winding up of the Australian National Railways Commission, the sale of its assets, and the empowering, effectively, of two ministers with the authority&mdash;without reference to the parliament, as I understand it&mdash;to decide upon the track access regime for this country and the maintenance regime for that track, and to place all of the arrangements that are integral to its continued operation in this country beyond parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, in relation to the legislative package that this government is pursuing, we have an alarming trend which is reflected again in this bill: a desire to avoid parliamentary scrutiny and leave matters in the hands of the executive. Of course, it can be said that oppositions complain about, and governments like, the situation where matters are kept within the control of the executive and beyond parliamentary scrutiny. I think it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4882"> is fair to say that it is not necessarily a good thing for this country to have its parliamentary executive running the country, without proper reference to parliament. There will always be a debate about where the line starts and finishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this case, I think we are talking about one of the most important aspects of this country's economic base: its transport infrastructure. As part of that, rail infrastructure is critical, given the future and looking to the 21st century of this country in relation to its trade and its internal relationships&mdash;the relationships between the states. We have here a bill which seems to be proceeding from a point of deciding to sell an asset and then deciding upon policy later. This, as I say, is a concern which underpins my concern about the whole of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the impact of this bill and that which it will have on the whole of the rail industry, I want to emphasise even further the impact it is likely to have on the state of Tasmania, the state that I represent in this chamber. With this legislation we see a lack of any specifics as to how it will deal with the question of creating a track authority for the future. But with the state of Tasmania, the situation is that there is no intent to protect the permanent way, the basic track, in the state of Tasmania; there are no guarantees that that will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, for some time this government has been telling the people of Australia that the long&hyphen;term security of the track is ensured, because the management of the track will be handed over to the proposed national track authority. That has not been set up in this bill; it is a matter that has been left to the ministers. There is no such authority; there is no such proposal for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this matter, the Senate references committee, in its report on the Brew report, on the continuing role of the Commonwealth in the Australian rail industry, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth proceeds to sell Tasrail&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is the Tasmanian part of Australian National Railways&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commonwealth should guarantee the continued operation of the railway, including provision of capital investment funds to maintain its modernisa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion program. This would compensate Tasmania for its effective exclusion from the benefits of the proposed track authority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say that I have been somewhat concerned by the way in which the need for these sorts of guarantees were dismissed, firstly, in the Brew report; secondly, by the government; and, thirdly, by the cavalier way in which the Tasmanian government has dealt with this matter. The Tasmanian government has simply been satisfied, as it were, with letting the market provide. It has said, `Sell Tasrail, and the market will provide us with a solution. We don't need any formal guarantees, we don't need anything in black and white, we don't need anything in this bill. We just want the asset sold; we don't want to take any responsibility for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate inquiry makes it clear that Tasmania is disadvantaged by that position. It needs guarantees of the continued operation of the railway. Also, it needs the provision of capital investment funds to maintain its modernisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent estimates program allowed me to ask some questions of Australian National in regard to its Tasrail operation. AN made it clear that basically, without the debt repayments that are allocated to its annual performance, Tasrail will be operating on a break-even basis; it is not a money losing proposition. That is, with a track infrastructure that needs some further work and given another couple of years of appropriate capital investment, the rail system, I believe, will be operating profitably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also recommended that this government, the federal government, pursue the option offered in the Brew report of eliminating the AN debt in Tasrail and returning the system to the Tasmania government. This government has indicated it is not going to do that&mdash;and that is probably because the Rundle government in Tasmania has indicated that it does not want the railway, it does not want to take on the responsibility of running the railway, it does not want to take on the responsibility of guaranteeing the maintenance of an operating railway system in Tasmania. It wants to wash its hands of the matter, just as this government wants to wash its hands of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4883"> the rail system in Tasmania and leave it to the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can argue that perhaps the market will do it better. Perhaps it will. But the other side of that question is that perhaps it will not. Perhaps it will not wish to continue operating. Perhaps it will only seek to operate the most profitable sections of the rail line. If that is the case&mdash;and that is a possibility in relation to the operation of railways in Tasmania&mdash;we could see a greater amount of traffic on Tasmania's roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of investment in the road system in Tasmania over the last 10 to 15 years. In some areas I would have to say that the road system is reasonable. It could do with some upgrading from time to time. If you increase the heavy vehicle usage of the road system, history has shown us that that system will deteriorate rather quickly. We see that some sections of the roads have been badly damaged by heavy traffic in part because they were not properly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made comments elsewhere about the inactivity of the Tasmanian government in relation to pursuing the correction of that situation and the funding of the rebuilding of those sections of road. If, as inevitably it will happen if you cut down on the rail system in Tasmania, there is more traffic on Tasmanian roads, there will be more damage. I believe it is quite short-sighted of the Tasmanian government to find itself in a position where it may require additional funds to maintain its roads because of its stance taken in relation to the sale of the Tasrail system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mainland Australia, through this government, has been given the appearance of the commitment to maintain rail infrastructure through the national track authority. We have not even been granted that. We simply do not know what the future will be for track operation in Tasmania. In any case, this bill does not give us any guarantees on rail infrastructure. As I said, those matters are missing from the bill. We do not know how the track maintenance regime will be guaranteed, what access obligations will exist or how the Commonwealth will ensure funding. Indeed, we know very little about the future of the track system in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do know is that in the last budget this government cut the amount of money allocated from $370 million to $185 million&mdash;not the $175 million that the minister announced in his press release immediately after the budget. In addition, again from my state, there is no safety or regulatory framework in existence when the rail network is sold&mdash;if it is to be sold&mdash;under this bill. That is an important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we hand the currently regulated system back to a private operator in an environment where there is not an existing non-government safety or regulatory framework in place? Surely that is a matter which is a priority prior to the effecting of the sale under this legislation. This bill does not address that. This government has not addressed that, and neither has the Tasmanian government. The Tasmanian parliament is in recess for three months and it will be rather difficult for it to pass any legislation while it is not sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect which I will touch on briefly is the potential for further job losses in Tasmania. It has been said that there have already been job losses with Australian National and with Tasrail. A lot of jobs have gone in this area. The fact is that a lot of jobs have gone in a lot of industries. In this case, there are no guarantees that the level of employment in a privatised industry will be anywhere near the level of employment which currently exists around Australia and, in particular, with Tasrail in Tasmania both now and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of further job losses in Tasmania cannot be emphasised enough. If there is a significant impact with that closure, it will be on top of the significant impact on the Tasmanian economy, particularly in the north&hyphen;east of the state where unemployment is running at around 11 per cent and is likely to increase with recently announced closures of manufacturing and service industries in the north-east of the state. There is nothing in this bill that will assist us here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the involvement of the Australian people in the decision making process through this parliament, in my view the government does not have the right to take that process away. There are also issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4884"> that need to be addressed with regard to the entitlements for the workers of the Australian National Railways. In the recent Senate estimates inquiry, I asked questions about both the superannuation scheme for those workers and the denial of redundancy payments to workers who had been injured whilst employed by Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers at Australian National in the past have been denied access to redundancy payments on the basis of their entitlement to workers compensation. Whilst AN have reviewed this policy, we are still waiting for confirmation that all workers who have left AN since the closure announcement who have been victims of a workplace accident or injury will be treated the same as other workers and receive their entitlement to redundancy from AN&mdash;in particular, circumstances that I raised with the chief executive officer of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AN principal superannuation scheme ignores the issue of redundancy as it does not allow for full vesting for employees until they have achieved 15 years service under that scheme, as I am informed. If full vesting were granted, I am led to believe that some 320 employees would receive a more equitable package. As I understand it, the superannuation scheme would be left with about a $5 million surplus if they do not change the scheme's rules so as to provide full vesting. That full vesting would be provided for within that surplus if it were allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report commissioned by the minister recommended that the Tasrail operation could be handed to the Tasmanian government with appropriate adjustment to financial assistance grants. It would appear that this recommendation, however, was deleted from the version of the executive summary which was initially handed down. I am wondering why that happened and whether there was some discussion between the two governments before it occurred. If that is the case, I wonder how appropriate and how principled such an action is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens are opposed to the privatisation of the national rail system. I, in particular, am opposed to the privatisation of the Tasmanian system. The idea behind this is that in some way or other private enterprise can run these systems as a better service to the public than the government can, but there is a lot of global experience to show that that is not the case. I am amazed at the arrangements being offered to private enterprise which, as things stand, are not being offered to the state government of Tasmania if it takes over Tasrail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasrail carries 16 per cent of the state's freight. It has not had passengers since the late 1970s, but that option should remain open in an age in which the clean, green and clever direction is the job prospective and economic prospective direction for Tasmania as we move out of the age of hydro&hyphen;industrialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasrail was handed from the state Labor government of Eric Reece in a very, I think, short-sighted move&mdash;or at least coming after a long period of neglect under successive Labor governments in Tasmania&mdash;to the Whitlam government in the early 1970s. Just before that, the same Premier, Eric Reece, had taken the train ride from Strahan to Queenstown on the Abt railway, which had a cog system up the centre because of the steepness of the grade. The idea had been borrowed from Swiss engineers and Swiss mountain railway systems. But there was no future seen for this railway with the closure of the smelters at Queenstown and the emergence of other options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are just three decades down the line and there are groups of people and businesses in Tasmania working to involve state government and anybody else they can to raise $20 million to put the Abt railway back, because it would be a magnificent attractant for the 100,000 tourists a year going to Strahan to visit the mighty Macquarie Harbour and Gordon-Franklin river systems, which previous Labor and Liberal govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4885"> ments wanted to flood&mdash;you might remember&mdash;at the start of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How short-sighted that, for the want of being able to look ahead a little, that railway system was pulled out. Now people are trying to raise $20 million to put it back in, because it would be a good thing to capitalise on Tasmania's wild and scenic reputation internationally. It would be a good thing as far as job creation and economic prosperity for the depressed west coastal region of Queenstown is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are in a situation where the government, through this legislation, is likely to sell off the whole of the Tasrail system for the same amount&mdash;about $20 million. That is one basic estimate. What extraordinary short-sightedness. What a failure to learn from history. What a propensity to repeat the mistakes of the past. What an indictment of the short&hyphen;sightedness of the material politics that predominate in this place and, indeed, in most chambers of parliament around this country and around the world in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the Tasrail system, it has, like other rail systems, had to compete against the road system, which has been hugely financed and assisted by serial governments at state and federal level. Massive amounts of money have subsidised the rail freight system. Where Tasrail needs to put aside a few million dollars each year to continue the upgrade of its lines and, hopefully, to move towards realignment of the system as well as upgrading of rolling stock, it cannot get it. But governments have no trouble in subsidising the average heavy transport on the road to the tune of somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 per annum. Billions of dollars go into the road system, not to provide for the needs of you and I in our cars, Mr Acting Deputy President MacGibbon, but to provide for the wear and tear of heavy road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a situation where, when I asked the minister for reasons why a brand new section of the national highway system near my home in Liffey in Tasmania was suddenly being dug up and resurfaced recently, the answer was, `Well, yes, that is costing $X million because the laboratory got the strength of the building materials wrong.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the laboratory did not get wrong was the access onto that highway system off the Oaks Road at Bracknell, which they had forgotten to put in and, at great expense, were putting in after the event of the road being built. What they appeared to get wrong&mdash;the minister might cavil with me on this&mdash;is the building of a major distributor near Deloraine across to the new system. Then there was a decision within 24 months to undertake a new configuration of the road system which warranted a new distributor. They pulled out the old one. There was a very high embankment system across the Meander River flats for some kilometres, but they pulled it out. There were massive works to remove the whole new road and put it a few hundred metres across to the east.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There we have millions of dollars being spent on fixing up a road system that should have been fixed in the first place, and it almost goes without comment. But if the rail system happens to ask for some millions of dollars to fix up its rolling stock or its track, there is an outcry about public subsidies. We have got this extraordinary system whereby, if it is for the roads and the big transport companies using the roads, billions of dollars can be put aside and that is not seen as a public subsidy. But if a much smaller and more modest amount is to be set aside to ensure that the rail system is up to date, improving and competitive, it is not the people so much as the governments&mdash;the competing political parties&mdash;that cry foul and say, `This system is not working properly. It is running at a loss. We had better do something about it. Let's privatise it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the Tasmanian rail system. On the most recent figures that I have seen, it is roughly in balance, with a $22 million income and a $22 million debit. If my figures are not wrong, some $4 million or $5 million of that is set aside to pay the interest on accumulated debt. In this legislation, the government is proposing to sell off that rail system minus the debt. It does not take Einstein to look at those figures and realise that the government is saying to private enterprise, `We will give you a $4 million to $5 million profit&hyphen;making enterprise straight 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4886"> off. You will be able to say, "We are running this at a profit whereas the state couldn't."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the Greens come in. We say, `If you are going to sell it off to private enterprise and exculpate their debts, let us put it back to the state government as a public concern. Let us put it back to the people of Tasmania and take those debts out and we will instantly have a rail system, working on freight, that is making $4 million to $5 million a year.' That sounds like a good thing to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Foley MHA, the Greens spokesperson on transport in Tasmania, is working at that end of the line to get the minority state Liberal government to see that this is not a debt&hyphen;making problem but a profit&hyphen;making asset if it is to be handed out of the federal arena and out of Commonwealth ownership free of debts. From there, there is no doubt that there needs to be upgrading of not only the rolling stock but also the management system in Tasmania. Looking at the figures, it has not passed my notice that, since Tasrail was handed to the federal authorities in about 1975, the numbers of people in the employ of Tasrail have fallen from something like 1,700 to something like 175. Here again, we have got part of the reason why Tasrail's books look so promising. Tasrail has been scaled right back&mdash;or `downsized', which I think is the common parlance for getting rid of jobs in both private and public industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can see again that it has been made ripe for handing across to private enterprise, which has had the hard job done for it through the numbers being scaled down to make the profit line look better. Tasrail ought to be just as ripe for a state government to take it on, with or without the redundancies&mdash;leave that optional for the workers&mdash;with the expertise available to make sure this system stays in public hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to give further reasons, besides the financial ones, as to why it should stay in public hands. I doubt that there is going to be any caveat in this sale to private enterprise, if it goes ahead, that says, `You must keep the  current Tasrail system as it is. You can't close components of it.' It is very important that we understand that, without such a caveat, we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to see further wind&hyphen;backs in the Tasrail system and further situations in which, a few decades down the line, people will be gnashing their teeth and saying, `If only we hadn't pulled that lump of rail out, what a great tourism asset it would be.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that is failing at government level in Tasmania, and has been for some decades, is the ability to see this change in the economic direction Tasmania must be taking. Stand up on the line just west of Burnie Central and you will see it slowly rusting because it has been out of use since its single freight purpose was brought to an end 12 months or so ago. Better still, if you drive along the road that is somewhere near that line, you will recognise that you are in one of the best coastal pieces of scenery as far as rail access is concerned anywhere in the world. That line then runs through to Ulverstone and on to Devonport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People sing the praises of the rail trip from San Francisco through to Los Angeles and down through Santa Barbara, but on Tasmania's north coast we have something that is better. Indeed, it is so close to the sea that in places there have been breakwaters built to prevent high seas in times of storm washing across the railway line and washing it out. It is a magnificent piece of coastal railway if you have got in mind scenery and tourism in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the folk from Wisconsin regional rail&mdash;one of the potential buyers&mdash;were here last week, I pointed out to them the potential on that rail because it is very important that they go and look at it if this legislation gets through and they are successful tenderers&mdash;not with a view to pulling the railway line up but with a view to new utilisation. Sadly, I have to admit that other than by the Greens in Tasmania there is very little of the vision that would see that line being put to the prospective use that it has been. Sadly again, maybe it does take people from elsewhere to come along and see that potential and to capitalise on it before the opportunity is irrevocably lost by the ripping up of the rail service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not make the mistake of Eric Reece and the Abt railway line. Let us see Tasmania 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4887"> as having special potential not only in the area of freight but also in the area of scenic and tourist potential with the existing rail set&hyphen;up. It is magnificently placed for that but it is going to take a new vision if that is to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, I had a good yarn with Wisconsin rail the other day and I understand that it is basically a freight enterprise. It has passenger interests in New Zealand and Canada but that is not its major purpose. I would be concerned that whoever does take over Tasrail looks at the real potential for introducing scenic transport as a complement to Tasmania's major job creator for the future, and that is its internationally outstanding wild and scenic beauty. One only has to see the full trains in summer, when they occasionally run from Hobart to Mount Field so that people can enjoy both steam rail and the scenic amenity there, to understand how popular it is domestically and how easily it could be converted into an international and interstate enterprise for the creation of jobs and the stimulus of the Tasmanian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by shorthanding, if you like, the Greens' alternative to this legislation. There are two components. First, we believe that Tasrail should not be sold as a component of the national rail system but should be divested from the Commonwealth, if it must be, as a discrete entity, because it is a discrete entity. Secondly&mdash;and I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to this end&mdash;if it is to be sold divested of its debts, therefore in a profitable configuration, the Tasmanian government, on behalf of the Tasmanian people, ought to be first offered that option of taking it back in the interests of Tasmania and the wider potential uses for rail&mdash;its long&hyphen;term viability with new options to the traditional ones of carting coal, carting logs to woodchip mills and in general carting freight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has gone through a long and depressing phase but we are now entering a new phase full of options for Tasmania. The Greens believe that those options should be investigated and are best enhanced by Tasmanians, working through the Tasmanian government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose the legislation as far as its impact on Tasmania is concerned. I will be moving constructive amendments at the committee stage. I hope that the government will see them in that light and support them. If not, I hope that the other components of this Senate will support the option of Tasrail going back into the hands of the Tasmanian people as the Commonwealth moves to divest itself of Tasrail, but without the debts and therefore as a profitable enterprise, to some other agent. Let that agent be the Tasmanian people. Let that new owner be the Tasmanian people and not private enterprise from somewhere else which will have a much more constricted view of the opportunities, potential and needs of rail in the future of Tasmania.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this very important debate about the proposed sale of Australian National with a little sadness because Australian National and the services that it provides to outback New South Wales are of the utmost importance. I have spoken about them here before and I will continue to speak about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saddened also that in the debate in the lower house, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), whose electorate in New South Wales contains a significant part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> rail link, chose to talk a lot about Port Augusta. Port Augusta is not in the seat of Parkes&mdash;Broken Hill, Parkes, Condobolin and Ivanhoe are in the seat of Parkes and they are places that are very concerned about what is going to happen as a result of the sale of Australian National. The concern relates to guarantees that cannot be given, guarantees that services like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> will not continue. That is of vital importance to people in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some ideas floated that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> could become the equivalent of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Train</EMPHASIS> or some of the other exotic tourist train journeys of the world. This ignores the fact that the majority of tourists to this country come from South&hyphen;East Asia and Asia. They are on a very short time frame&mdash;about a week or maybe 10 days&mdash;and, as a result, train journeys that are two or three 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4888"> days long are not part of their itinerary. It is different for those who are backpackers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, in conjunction with the state service, runs an integral public transport service to outback NSW. We know that it is a vital link for tourism and that hard work has been put into its development. This service is important for tourism but, as I keep repeating, it is an extremely important public transport link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was brought home to us when the committee, of which I am a participating member, held hearings in the city of Broken Hill. Sure, the mayor of Broken Hill is a Labor Party member and, sure, the Labor vote in Broken Hill is about 70 to 72 per cent. But even the chamber of commerce was opposed to the privatisation of Australian National. Chambers of commerce are not normally known in this country as being mad keen supporters of the Australian Labor Party or the anti&hyphen;privatisation position, but that is the position of the chamber of commerce in Broken Hill; they also oppose the sale of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why people are opposing the sale of Australian National is that nobody can give a cast&hyphen;iron guarantee that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and other transport services are going to remain on the western line. There are grave concerns that those services will be re&hyphen;routed through Melbourne and Adelaide. Whilst we have no problems with people in Melbourne and Adelaide having a rail service and being part of this service, the people of Broken Hill, Ivanhoe, Menindee, Condobolin and Parkes are very concerned about what the impact on them will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke last week in another debate about the fact that, when there is rain, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and the line between Ivanhoe and Broken Hill is the only land transport corridor available. The roads are gravel; and it is hardly gravel because it is black soil plain country. It is the black soil mud that sticks to you. You stick to it in the dry and it sticks to you in the wet and it does not need a great deal of wet to stick to you. These are the sorts of things that people have to contend with. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Ivanhoe have a small hospital facility but, if they require hospitalisation for significant problems, their nearest public hospital is Broken Hill, over 300 kilometres up the track. They have the Royal Flying Doctor Service which evacuates people from Ivanhoe to Broken Hill, but they are not able to evacuate the relatives of those people. So Ivanhoe relies upon both the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and the state rail service that took over from the Silver City service which was reintroduced by the Labor government in New South Wales last year. They have to rely on that to get them to Broken Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Menindee is another small community. These communities have been railway towns and have provided significant services and support to the railways in this country for over 100 years. The number of people employed on the railway in those areas has certainly decreased with the advent of diesel and the phasing out of steam. There is no longer the need for the water refuelling stops to be strategically placed and the journeys&mdash;thank God&mdash;are faster. Therefore, there is less need for workers but it is still a very important service to Menindee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> brought 27,000 tourists into Broken Hill and it has been estimated that that expenditure is around $6.8 million or 80 full&hyphen;time jobs. Broken Hill is a town whose history is steeped in the mining industry but, as with all mining communities, the ore body eventually runs out. Over the last decades, the number of people employed in the mines has gone down from 4,500 to 700. There are now 1,100 people employed around Broken Hill in the tourist industry, so you can see that tourism is of vital significance to the people of Broken Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourist industry in Broken Hill is beginning to devise packages that dovetail in very well with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and with the state rail train so that people can spend three or four days in the Hill and go out and see the outback, and it really is the accessible outback. Not far from Broken Hill is Silverton, which is a significant area for film production. Just past Silverton is the Mundi Mundi Plain. When you stand at sunset on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4889"> escarpment on the Mundi Mundi Plain and look west, you just see red dirt. You see the desert; you see the harsh interior of this country. This is something that, in the last financial year, 27,000 tourists were able to avail themselves of. A lot of these were Australian tourists who do not want and cannot afford to be on trains at the high priced end of the market. They are a wide variety of people, including backpackers. We know from the figures that have been done that this is the number of people who actually arrived on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, because the Broken Hill Tourism Board is a very well&hyphen;managed and vibrant board and they can tell you where their tourists are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is vitally important that people take cognisance of the fact that these trains do have a valuable contribution to make to this country. Even in New South Wales, which is often thought of as being Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, we have significant areas of isolation and remoteness. We have significant distances, and when you get out towards Menindee and the Hill, you find that you are joining with areas in northern South Australia and the east of Western Australia. There is not a great deal from Broken Hill until you get to Kalgoorlie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me about this package to sell off Australian National is that in the rail reform package $112 million was set aside for redundancies and so forth and $20 million for regional adjustment. The rest of the $2 billion package was for existing liabilities or money that was already budgeted. This year's budget cut $80 million over four years to the proposed track authority. The government has now made a commitment to that of $175 million, as opposed to the $370 million that the previous Labor government was offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just indications as to why the people of Broken Hill and those areas do not feel secure about the future of Australian National. They see no guarantees and they see cuts to expenditure. That, for them, is a very worrying situation&mdash;of course it is a worrying situation. These isolated communities have every right to be worried. As I said, the Indian Pacific is for the people of Broken Hill, Ivanhoe and Menindee. It is a public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transport service. It is not a service that is there so that people can choose whether or not to use it. If people do not use the train, what are they left with? They are left with the option of flying. If they want to go to Sydney they can fly with Hazelton from Broken Hill direct to Sydney. The full air fare is over $700. There will be occasions when they can get discount fares, but $450 is the usual fare. If people wish to go to Melbourne they can fly, but they have to go via Mildura. Of course, sometimes the only way to get to Sydney is via Adelaide or via Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are long trips involving many hundreds of dollars. They are well beyond the means of a pensioner, and there is a significant aged community in Broken Hill. With the downturn in mining, people have moved away. The younger people have moved away; the older people have chosen to stay. The people living in the Broken Hill area still like to go and visit their families who live away from them. That is very important to them. If they have not got a train to go on and they cannot afford an aircraft fare, what are they left with? They are left with bus travel. They can catch a bus that connects with the XPT at Dubbo. To do that, they have to leave Broken Hill at 3 a.m. in the morning&mdash;a great time&mdash;and face a nine&hyphen; or 10&hyphen;hour road journey. Of course, the buses have also got to miss the kangaroos and the emus. There is a fair number of them out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the pensioners in Broken Hill&mdash;and I have spoken to many elderly people in Broken Hill&mdash;do not like bus travel. They like train travel. When they are doing a journey of that significant length they need to be able to get up and move around. They need to be able to use the toilet facilities, and they find this easier on a train. There is also the problem of access. People find there is a marked difference between getting on and off a train and getting and on and off a bus&mdash;a huge difference. They find getting on and off the train very easy. The train station at Broken Hill has a very good ramp. You can just about drive right up to the station platform. People can walk up the slight incline onto the station and walk straight onto the train. An immense number of elderly people have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4890"> complained to me about the difficulty they have getting on and off buses. That is one of the things that the people of Broken Hill do not want to do. They want to use the train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you cut any services to Broken Hill I think it is fair to warn you that you will receive a frosty welcome which will certainly highlight to the rest of Australia just what you have done to the people of Broken Hill and how you may have made them more isolated. Look at what they did when the Silver City Comet was taken off the rail line. The Silver City Comet used to run from Parkes to Broken Hill several times a week. The service was cut by the Greiner conservative government in New South Wales. The law&hyphen;abiding citizens of Ivanhoe, a small rural community, put their four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicles across the rail track and held up the train. When the train got to Broken Hill it was somehow commandeered and kept at the station. It was then placed in a museum. Anybody visiting Broken Hill for the next six years or so was told, `That's the Silver City Comet that got stolen off us. That's the service we lost.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of thing that they will do, and they will do it very vocally. They will certainly make sure the people of Australia know. If the government even puts at risk their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, their public transport, it will certainly be accused&mdash;quite rightly, I think&mdash;of neglecting the concerns and interests of remote Australia. As I said, it is remote Australia out there. It is the accessible outback. People there are working hard to overcome the difficulties of living in a remote area and the downturn in the mining sector. They are looking to improve their tourism potential&mdash;and they have plenty, believe me. The Brushmen of the Bush, some of the best artists in this country, are out at Broken Hill. There are probably more art galleries per square kilometre in Broken Hill than anywhere else in this country. This is because of the beauty of the place, the stunning grandeur and the fact that it evokes in these artistic characters such incredible dynamism and an ability to display and express what they see and what they feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of years ago the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> service dropped back to one a week. When 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the service was increased to the usual two there was a significant growth in the number of people who travelled.

In evidence to the committee, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major marked increase we had in the use of trains by tourists visiting Broken Hill commenced when the second IP service was commenced in about 1993 or 1994. Once that second train was on the track it really improved our passenger performance out of that area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to speak on behalf of South Australian industry and those South Australians who work in the railways. Many rail workers and their families are watching with a great deal of concern as the Australian rail system is used as part of an ideological experiment. Yes, there can be no doubt that this is an experiment. There are no guarantees that selling AN and privatising the entire industry in due course will improve the employment circumstances or the future of rail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supporters of the sell-off cannot seem to explain how it will benefit the railway communities of my state, nor can they explain how it will benefit rail in the long term. The Port Augusta council supports the sale; yet I see no evidence that a private owner would maintain the Port Augusta workshops or keep AN employees in their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill before us empowers two ministers to determine the fate of rail in Australia. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) are going to be in the position to determine what happens to any assets and what ultimately happens to Australian National itself. This Senate will be handing to these two ministers virtually total power over the Australian railway system. I say that we must not allow such an expansion of the executive power which will limit our ability to stand up for the people who elected us. This legislation empowers the ministers to override existing legislation and prevents the full use of the Senate's powers of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report showed us how commercial considerations can be used as an excuse to hide the government's activities from the public. This process must be transparent&mdash;too many people's futures depend on it. The Senate references inquiry, established by Labor, into the Brew report and the future of Commonwealth involvement in rail made 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some very important observations and findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry discovered that, whilst the Brew report had provided adequate analysis of the individual businesses that make up AN, it did not and could not provide a guide or framework to the future development of rail in this nation. Indeed, Labor is of the view that no major decisions can be made about the development of the rail industry unless there is a comprehensive analysis of the whole sector. Further, Labor believes, as did the Senate inquiry, that there must be a land transport policy framework that takes into account all factors which relate to the use of road and rail. There must be a long&hyphen;term approach to take into account the possible investment that may occur as well as the needs of agricultural, transportation and manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 24 November, the government launched its rail reform package but, despite the claim that this was a $2 billion reform measure, only $122 million was actually new money. In the style of the South Australian Olsen Liberal government, we see the Howard government announcing spending that has already been announced. The inquiry was critical of this package. On top of the limited financial support for rail there were also a number of other concerns that the inquiry had. These include issues relating to the funding for the upgrading of track and to the value of the Commonwealth's rail assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry also found that National Rail should not be sold in any event prior to the end of the National Rail agreement. But this is clearly a risk with this government's current policy and mentality. In the last budget there was a further cut of $80 million over four years for the proposed Track Authority. This organisation was already going to begin life without enough funds to fulfil its role as the guardian of our basic rail infrastructure. Labor was committed to giving $370 million to Track Australia; the coalition have cut that expenditure to $175 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not told us how much AN is going to bring, if it is sold. The lack of understanding of what the sale actually means is concerning. The myths that are being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4892"> created about what it will do for rail are even more concerning. Selling AN is not a fix for rail in Australia, particularly in the current environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can understand the despair of some workers about the instability of their jobs and their kids' futures that leads them to support a sale. No-one can blame workers for looking towards a positive development in rail, but the government is not offering positive changes with this legislation. The Shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Tanner, attempted to ensure that the parliament maintain some control over this process. In his amendment at the second reading stage, Labor indicated the conditions under which rail policy and this debate must be developed. We will again move this amendment in the Senate. Those conditions are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, and as I previously mentioned, we want to see coherent policy which takes into account the entire rail industry and infrastructure. Secondly, we want to see agreements with the state governments involved about the future of their respective rail industries and the role that they will play in rail. Thirdly, we want to see a labour market adjustment program for displaced AN workers and a better regional adjustment package. A measly $20 million is just not enough. Fourthly, Labor wants the maintenance of all existing passenger server operations, as well as travel concessions. The community must not suffer with the loss of services or increased unfairness when it comes to public transport costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, we want the government to live up to its recent rhetoric about apprenticeships and ensure that all apprentices continue to be employed, at least until the end of their contracts. Sixthly, we want the South Australian and Tasmanian governments to establish safety and regulatory arrangements for the rail industry. Seventhly, we want all employees who have left AN due to work related illness or injury since the announcement of the rail package last year to be offered redundancy pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Labor wants AN to ensure that the superannuation arrangements are fair for workers who are part of an AN principal scheme. We want to see any surplus in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme distributed to workers and not paid to the government. This scheme does not have full vesting of employer contributions. Workers are treated as though they have resigned, even though they have been compulsorily retrenched. These are the things that greatly concern us about the sale and its immediate impact on jobs and rail infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of particular concern to Labor relates to the track authority, as was originally proposed by Labor in government but which has also been a part of the government's policy. The importance of this matter is evidenced by Labor's attempt to amend the bill to ensure the development of an effective track authority. We will continue with our pursuit of these guarantees during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of AN is supposed to see the transfer of interstate mainland track to the track authority. However, the bill does not ensure that this happens. We assume that the new authority is to be established soon, but the bill does not prevent the sale of interstate mainland track, nor does it even define what interstate mainland track is. The public must be assured that the major lines that will be the basis of economic development are protected from the most unsatisfactory possibility of private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that much of rail infrastructure should be protected from the sell&hyphen;off process. An obvious situation is with the Alice Springs to Tarcoola line, which will be an essential part of a future Alice Springs to Darwin rail line. But there are other important lines which must be protected&mdash;the Whyalla to Port Augusta line, which is essential to BHP's steel operation, and national rail's steel freight business. This line will be essential to the development of new industries in Whyalla, and as a South Australian I know how important this transport option is to the development of potential new industries in the Spencer Gulf region and beyond. There are other South Australian lines that must be protected as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor finds itself in a position where it cannot support the passage of this bill. It does not address the concerns of the communities and workers concerned. It does not give a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4893"> vision for rail in Australia. It does not even come close. We are in a situation where the planning by the government has not been done. Labor has given the minister plenty of opportunity to expand the investigation into the rail industry, but he has chosen to do nothing. He has not even been to visit the workers in Port Augusta, where his decisions will most probably have the greatest single effect on a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want security for workers. We want continuity for apprentices. We want proper support for regional Australia, not pocket money. We want people to be at the centre of this decision, not blind ideology.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are not willing advocates of the privatisation of public assets. We have been staunch critics of the ideological bias which has blindly driven the privatisation agenda in Australia. For more than a decade, Labor and the coalition have voted together&mdash;time and again&mdash;to sell&hyphen;off, contract out and downgrade public sector assets and services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, we have stuck to our principles and consistently voted against privatisations which have not demonstrated a clear, net, long-term public benefit. We have opposed the sale of contracting out of community services, of hospitals and of power and water services. We voted against the sale of Qantas. We voted against the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We voted against the sale of Telstra. We voted against these privatisations because they were not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key problems, of which we have been repeatedly critical, is that Australian governments, both state and federal, have forged ahead with privatisation with very little consideration given to the alternatives or to the medium&hyphen; to long-term community and economic consequences. Another strong concern of ours has been the consistent underpricing of public assets. Australia has lost billions in the process of sale which has undervalued their assets. Underpricing of public assets has been one of the hallmarks of privatisation in Australia. It happened with the Commonwealth Bank, with Qantas and with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. What 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it has meant is that a relatively small number of people, the new owners, have made windfall gains at the expense of all the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third concern of ours is the risk which privatisation means for community service obligations. These are genuine concerns which must be addressed and which we would like to see dealt with in this bill. The Democrats reject the economic rationalist mind&hyphen;set. This is a mind&hyphen;set which sees no value in the community, in society, and where there is no need for social or community interests to be upheld or protected by governments. The world of the economic rationalist is one in which governments only exist to deregulate, privatise and withdraw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are not, however, opposed to greater efficiency in the delivery of services. Nor are we opposed to privatisation where it delivers real social and long-term economic benefits. What we are opposed to is seeing privatisation as a goal in itself. It is a fundamental flaw to see privatisation as inherently a good thing. Privatisation is simply a means to an end&mdash;that is to say, it is only appropriate when it furthers the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we first need to decide is what sort of social and economic benefits and services we want to deliver to the community&mdash;that is, we must define the public interest and then we must carefully explore whether or not privatisation will deliver those benefits and services. It is for this reason that my colleague and fellow Democrat Senator John Woodley, when he chaired the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into the Brew report and the continuing role of the Commonwealth in the Australian rail industry, said about privatisation that he felt it contributed to the corporatisation of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Australian National Railways Commission we believe there is a case to be made for privatisation. When previously in government, the Labor Party presided over the slow and steady decline of our rail industry and the decline of AN. I am aware that there were enthusiasts for rail within the then government but they did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4894"> have the ear of the Treasurer or of the cabinet and ultimately rail continued to decline. As a consequence, the ALP effectively destroyed AN during their term in government and desperate changes are unfortunately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is now dire. Morale in AN is at an all-time low and good managers have disappeared because governments have insisted on treating rail as a business rather than as a service&mdash;what is more, as a short&hyphen;term business. They have convinced everyone that debt levels are high. Yes, the cost is high, but so it is for schools, hospitals, roads and all our other services. The way in which rail is structured and managed has meant that debt is indeed now an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN has effectively been destroyed and driven into the ground. Both this and the former government are responsible. In our view it has been broken, and, like Humpty Dumpty, the pieces cannot be put together again. Clearly, therefore, something needs to be urgently done. Clearly, a revitalisation of rail is still needed&mdash;on economic grounds, on environmental grounds and on community grounds. Because of the state AN is in now, we believe that the sale of some of AN's assets may be warranted&mdash;where an injection of capital funds and managerial expertise can provide a much needed boost, especially if jobs are to be safeguarded and especially if rail is to start to grow at the expense of the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a position that we are not alone in reaching. The Public Transport Union have made it clear that they want AN sold. Many of the workers at AN have made it clear that they want AN sold. Key rail organisations, in particular Rail 2000 and the Australian Railways Association, have made it clear that they want AN sold. They have accepted that the way AN is and the way it is managed and is funded will mean its continued decline unless it is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the Democrats are therefore prepared to consider a sale, but we can only support a sale that is clearly in the public interest and will deliver a net economic and community benefit. I have said there is a rationale for the sale, because the alternative that this government has threatened us with is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complete closure and failure of the rail network. However, the government has attempted to rush through a sale without properly working through the issues, engaging in adequate consultation or establishing an appropriate framework for the industry. It is an exceptionally complex issue&mdash;and all of us in this chamber understand that&mdash;but the government has not addressed the complexity in a manner which gives any of us confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which has sought to legislate in terms of rail by press release rather than through the parliament. The ridiculous sale timetable that has resulted tells the story&mdash;and we are dealing with such a complex issue&mdash;when expressions of interest closed in mid&hyphen;April. That is about two months ago. The sale timetable left little time for prospective buyers to lodge suitably detailed and thought through submissions. It put them under undue stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Final offers had to be lodged by early June, giving selected bidders only a few weeks to work on their submissions. We are talking here about submissions that involve very substantial amounts of money and very substantial commitments. One bidder, preferring to remain anonymous, was reported as saying that it was ridiculous to ask bidders to prepare adequate documentation in such a short space of time. It was neither commercial in its speed nor helpful to those who might be the salvation of our rail industry. Another person questioned why the sale was being rushed through when the new owner cannot and will not be operating on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the question of how government dealt with the sale. The sale bill was not tabled in the House of Representatives until 14 May 1997 after expressions of interest had been called for. It should have been tabled last session. The Senate has been put under undue pressure once again to try to deal with a bill with terrific ramifications in a very short space of time. If opposition parties had been given more and adequate time to examine clauses it could have avoided the need for getting an exemption from the cut&hyphen;off motion. It might have also resulted in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4895"> far more cross-party support for fundamental reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also needs to be pointed out that neither the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), nor the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) nor their representatives in the Senate have sought our opinion or bothered to consult directly with us. We, amongst the other six parties in the Senate, are responsible for the passage of legislation. How the government and this minister can expect to manage their legislation in the Senate when they do not consult with the parties concerned in advance of the legislation beats me. This minister makes a practice of this sort of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, it was only recently that the government realised that complementary legislation had to be passed by the South Australian parliament. The South Australian bill is yet to be tabled in that parliament because they have to wait and see whether this bill is passed. As a consequence, the Senate is put under that pressure as well. This is not management; this is incompetence and such incompetence should be recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also approached rail reform more generally in an inadequately structured and inadequately planned fashion. Let us consider some of the issues. Firstly, the sale is being rushed through while key rail reforms, including establishment of a National Track Authority and including much needed funding for track upgrading, have been deferred. What does it say for a government, which should be dedicated to infrastructure development and jobs, when it has deferred both those issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A meagre $175 million over four years was promised by the government for upgrading of track, yet they announced that this had been deferred. In contrast, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics had recommended $3.2 billion over 20 years, not $175 million over four years. Such large expenditure is essential, especially if the interstate tracks in Victoria and New South Wales are to be upgraded to acceptable standards. This contrasts hugely with the approach to road, which easily gets billions of dollars expendi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ture and on which the government has a fixation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is the existing community service obligations&mdash;obligations which the government simply refuses to acknowledge. The AN interstate passenger services and the Tasmanian freight operations are, in our view, community service obligations&mdash;that is, they are loss making activities financed and funded from the budget. That is a common approach to all services of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no guarantee that funding for subsidised fares will continue. In fact this government simply chooses to bury its head in the sand. When I asked the government on notice last year to provide me with details of all AN's community service obligations, they sent me a response saying that there are none. That is a very strange matter. I appreciate that the community service obligation has a particular meaning in legislation but, in the broader sense of those words, community service obligation is the obligation you have to the citizens of this country to provide an essential service, yet you do not do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern with this bill is that it enables all the tracks to be sold. It is no good having that power and then saying that you do not intend to exercise that power. Frankly, the Senate would be most unwise to trust this government with such an approach. The government has said it will sell only the intrastate&mdash;that is, the South Australian and Tasmanian tracks&mdash;and not the interstate track, which is to be owned and managed by a new National Track Authority based in Adelaide. But what guarantee have we that this will occur and why does the bill not expressly say that? Why does the bill enable absolutely everything to be sold? Is it deliberate deceit? Is it an oversight? What is the reason for it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the tracks and associated infrastructure, such as terminals, are a natural monopoly and, in our view, should be retained in full public ownership. I am aware that last year Labor agreed to the lease of the airports&mdash;in my opinion to their shame, and against which we voted&mdash;which were also a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4896"> natural monopoly. I hope this time they will look at the track in an entirely different fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are prepared to agree to a sale of some aspects of rail but conditions are required. We are happy for the government to redefine its role in rail, but we will not support a government seeking to abrogate its role. Government must take an active position on the future of rail and on the future of its land transport strategy, which it does not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments will guarantee that a National Track Authority is established and will be based in South Australia. Those amendments are a repeat, if you like, of the government's original commitments. The authority will own and manage the track and associated assets and it will be backed up by legislation guaranteeing that parliamentary approval will be required before those track and associated assets can be sold off. We will also be seeking a guarantee that desperately needed funding for track upgrading, as promised by the government, is restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the commencement date of the bill should be when the Commonwealth government has reached agreements with South Australia and Tasmania on funding assistance for development of their rail infrastructures. We believe that the bill should provide a labour market adjustment program for displaced AN workers. Some of these, of course, are issues that Labor has advanced. We believe that the South Australian and Tasmanian governments should put in place safety and regulatory arrangements for the rail industry before the transfers take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that Australian National should demonstrate that all employees who have left since the announcement on 24 November 1996 not voluntarily but as a result of work related illness or injury should be offered redundancy payments. We believe that Australian National should alter the trust deed of the AN principal scheme to allow full vesting of employer contributions to all employees that have left or leave after 24 November 1996 and to ensure that appropriate adjustment payments are made to those who have already left AN's employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want to see a repetition of the Qantas scandal. We want to see that the employment and training of apprentices is guaranteed until completion of their apprenticeship contracts, and that should be a sale condition. We believe that existing passenger services and concession arrangements should be guaranteed for at least five years as a condition of sale. It is appropriate that the government ensures that, in the transition period, rail's customers are not left in the air whilst any private or public owners find their feet in the new conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose that, rather than the sale, the government should consider a long&hyphen;term lease of the Tasrail and South Australian Freight tracks and associated infrastructure, but that, regardless of whether it is a sale or lease, the state governments should have the right of first refusal. They should have the right to make the decision as to whether they wish to run their own rail infrastructure and under what terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that funding for track upgrading should be restored to the level promised by the government, which was $175 million over four years. We think that should be effective immediately. We would like the government to spend a great deal more, but we are not the government, so we can only ask them to spend what they have in fact agreed to spend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the government should agree to hold a public inquiry to get a cross&hyphen;party approach to this complex and vital issue and should table an integrated land transport strategy in both houses of parliament by 1 July 1998. You cannot progress rail unless you have a view on pricing, on access, on competition, on the integration of systems, on customer services, on community service obligations and so on. That requires government to produce a land transport strategy on economic, environmental and community grounds. We believe that the exemption of the bill from the Legislative Instruments Act 1997 should not go ahead. We think they should refer back to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to speak briefly about the points raised by the Labor Party in its second reading amendment. Those points are good ones. They are ones the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4897"> must address, but we do not believe that they are good enough to delay the bill. We believe those points should be included in the bill where they can be, but they must not be used as a means to defer or delay the bill. We believe the concerns raised in the second reading amendment can be accommodated, whilst still passing the bill. We would make the commencement of the bill dependent on those issues being addressed by the government. Accordingly, with regret, whilst we agree with many of the points being made by Labor in the second reading amendment, we will be opposing it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hundreds of thousands of people in Australia have, to their credit or even detriment, been workers for railways or the PMG's department, or both. I am one of those.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have to say that this matter has been a matter where I have had to put aside my emotional attachment, if you like, to the railways. This attachment is part of our family tradition. My grandfather happened to be the boiler attendant at the Finke on the early part of the track. I come from a railway family and was born in a railway town, Quorn in South Australia. It is no longer a railway town. It has not been for a considerable period of years, although there is a good tourist railway chugging along that neck of the woods. I recommend anybody to go on it. I have an attachment. I worked for some little time on the transcontinental railway in the 1950s. As I say, one needs to put aside the emotional attachment that one has if one is to make a decision and to contribute to this legislative debate. I hope that, to the extent that I am able, I have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decision made by the previous government in 1993 to allow all of AN's interstate freight business to be transferred to the National Railways Commission, I believe, put the Australian National Railways Commission on the skids. The review of the Australian National Railways Commission and the National Rail Corporation in 1996, out of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which came the Brew report, pointed to the extremely serious financial and operational position of ANR and, to a lesser extent, that of NRC. Brew reported that the position of ANR was so serious as to warrant shutting down significant parts of the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of this particular matter, I here interpolate that, whilst my primary interest is in the state of Tasmania, I nonetheless feel I have an obligation to South Australians and, indeed, Western Australians. In relation to Tasmania, the Brew report went so far as to suggest that, if short&hyphen;line operators could not be found, the operation should be totally closed down. It would seem to me that successive governments have failed to provide an efficient and viable rail system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the deregulation of freight transport in Tasmania has seen a substantial drop in the tonnages on Tasrail. Under Commonwealth government ownership, there has been a huge decline of employment in Tasrail; it is down now to 240 people. This is a far cry from the time when there were thriving workshops in northern Tasmania. I knew quite a few people in the workshops in northern Tasmania; in fact, in the days of the Trades Hall and the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, I eventually got the ARU back into the fold. There were very significant contributions made both in southern Tasmania, and in the north and the north-west coast. I remember very fondly one of those unionists who was the among those who were the backbone of the Devonport Trades and Labour Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view of the Tasmanian government clearly is that the sale of Australian National should proceed. That also is the view of those unionists with whom I have spoken and&mdash;I am quite well aware of this fact&mdash;it particularly is the view of a number of unionists who are working in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not, and will not, support this bill, unless a number of issues relating to Tasrail employees and rail infrastructure are resolved. I hope that they have come to that resolution in the last week; as I understand it, they are nearing that situation now. I have been given certain undertakings and assurances by the government in this regard. My concerns are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4898"> that, should the sale of Australian National proceed, the Commonwealth should face up to its obligations in regard to all Tasrail employees. It should ensure that the track is left in good condition, and that environmental remediation be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the outstanding matters which will affect some AN employees relates to superannuation. This has been referred to, I think, by almost every speaker who has spoken in the bill's second reading debate. In this respect, alterations need to be made to the trust deed of the AN principal scheme to enable full vesting of employer contributions. Otherwise, some employees facing redundancy will be severely financially disadvantaged. I am advised that the ANR Commission is to consider this matter at its meeting this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, I hope that the proposed privatisation of AN will result in an efficient, competitive, dynamic and reliable rail system in Tasmania and South Australia. I am aware of the fact that it is the view of persons who know the situation intimately in Tasmania that the Tasmanian railways are in danger of imploding. It is of vital importance that rail transport continue as an option in Tasmania for Tasmanian businesses. It is suggested that, if this bill is not accepted and does not go ahead, the outlook is very, very grim indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to the sale of public monopoly assets. But, of course, the question of monopoly does not arise in respect of AN because there is competition&mdash;road competition and sea  competition&mdash;from the north-west coast through to southern Tasmania. That is not often adverted to. In fact, the continuance of rail in Tasmania, in my view, is absolutely vital for the future development of the state and for the future alleviation of the burden on the Tasmanian roads system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of major investments are being considered in the mining and manufacturing industries in Tasmania which may well rely on the existing rail infrastructure and an efficient operating rail system, which private enterprise appears to offer&mdash;well, that is what they are saying. It is vital for the development of an integrated sea, road and rail transport system to service the needs of the Tasmanian community. Several potential operators have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> already indicated that there is the potential to increase the amount of goods carried on rail and to move tonnage off the road system. As we from Tasmania all know, the Emu Bay railway, operating in the west and north&hyphen;west of Tasmania, has demonstrated that the rail system can be operated efficiently in Tasmania for the benefit of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further area for development is tourism&mdash;and, of course, tourism is vital to Tasmania. A number of operators conduct historical tours, including the Tasmanian Railway Preservation Society operating in the Derwent Valley. They are, of course, seeking to improve these tourist services, and I would be very pleased to see a boost along for those particular services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the reasons that I have given, I am keen that an efficient, competitive, dynamic and reliable system be maintained both for my state and for the operation in South Australia. If the sale of AN as proposed in this bill is the only way to achieve this, provided the Commonwealth meets its obligations, including its obligations to existing employees, and ensures the good condition of track and rolling stock assets, I am inclined to support the second reading stage of this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you're the ones who want the legislation through.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do. I think there are a couple of things that need to be said. Firstly, I want to thank all the speakers who have participated in the debate. I did not have the privilege of hearing them all directly in the chamber, except for Senator Harradine, but I did find Senator Harradine's comments very sympathetic, particularly to the workers, and very understanding of the difficulty that would be faced by the workers and those who hope to rely on efficient rail services, particularly in Tasmania and South Australia, if this legislation does not go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4899">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly observant of the fact that Senator Harradine had consulted because, in many respects, it has been very puzzling to me to hear statements made by politicians claiming that they know what the workers think or that they have a view on the subject or that somehow they have not had enough time to form a view on the subject when clearly Senator Harradine, with all his manifold responsibilities, is able to consult and to ascertain what the true position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the Democrats are claiming that they have not had sufficient time to consult on the matter. This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives some six weeks ago. It was foreshadowed as long ago as last November. An inquiry into the sale has been before the relevant Senate reference committee. That is what I think makes very hollow claims by people like the Greens and Senator Brown that there has been a lack of consultation with the workers. The Greens did not attend any of the reference committee hearings nor have they contacted by letter or by phone the minister for transport in Tasmania or I suspect the minister for transport in this place regarding the future of Tasrail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Democrats making similar complaints, we know there have been very extensive representations made by the workers. There is one letter that I thought summarised the way in which this exercise has proceeded. It is addressed to senators and ministers, it is dated 28 June and it is signed. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an employee of Australian National, I wish to register my disgust at the proposed blockage of the sale by Labor and Democrat parties. I have been trying to register my disgust with these parties for the last two weeks, both state and federal, but have been fobbed off each time. The two Democrat senators offices have said they don't handle this, talk to Senator Woolly [sic] in Queensland or Andrew Murray in Perth. Meg Lees office was a bit understanding, would pass my concern on to Senator Woolly [sic]. Stott-Despoja's office wasn't interested at all and told me to talk to Andrew Murray. I have twice rung her office to voice my concern. Both times I was told to talk to someone else. I have spoken to Lindsay Tanner's office in Melbourne but got little response from them as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well. I have tried Mike Wran's office as well and was told someone will call back.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor in this state have said workers don't want the sale to go ahead, but who have they talked to because, believe me, no-one has bothered to talk to me or my co&hyphen;workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That I think is pretty typical of the response that has emerged from the workers themselves. For those who purport to have the workers' interests in mind, I did run through this in the Senate last week. It is quite clear that a number of the leading spokesmen, including the state secretary of the Public Transport Union, have warned that any delay to the sale would cause unneeded hardship and grief for the workers. Len Scharenberg of the Australian Workers Union was interviewed after the visit of Lindsay Tanner to Port Augusta. Again, I made it clear in the Senate what he thought of the outcome of that visit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least he's been there; the minister for transport hasn't.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble is they wanted Mr Beazley to go there, but Mr Beazley would not go there. Instead he muzzled Mr Tanner. One is entitled to suspect that Mr Tanner himself is a bit perplexed as to why he has been giving riding instructions to oppose this sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have you been there?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not have direct responsibility. I have been there in the past but not in regard to this issue. The important thing is that the people in Port Augusta in particular, the residents of South Australia in general and the residents of Tasmania simply cannot comprehend why those who purport to be close to the workers are not consulting with the workers and are doing something that is quite inimical to the workers' interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think that has now been flushed out. It is quite clear what the workers' view is. They are very keen to see this legislation go ahead. I note what Senator Harradine said about various undertakings and assurances. I do not have personal knowledge of those, but I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4900"> assume that those negotiations have been proceeding and that he is justified in having confidence that the meeting of the ANR Commission later this week will endorse the full vesting of employer contributions. On that basis, the concerns that have been legitimately expressed will be resolved. Then we are left, essentially, with the question of whether or not this is going to salvage an industry which clearly has been going backwards as a result of inaction over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think I need to add any more to the debate. Hopefully, I have demonstrated that not only are the arguments very compelling but those who purport to oppose them are not consulting the workers and, therefore, are not representing their interests. The truth of the matter is that the workers themselves want the sale to go ahead. The future for those workers themselves does depend on the sale and the injection of private sector enterprise and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all share Senator Harradine's aspiration for an efficient, competitive, dynamic and, obviously, successful rail service. Again, I think one could only agree that the outlook would be very grim indeed if it did not go ahead. In fact, all of the organisations and the workers themselves who are calling for the sale to proceed are under no illusions about what their prospects would be if it did not. So, on that basis, I trust that we will be able to see this bill through the parliament tonight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through the chair, Senator Alston, I suggest you do not use that sort of tone with me. This bill should have been dealt with in the next session. The Australian Democrats agreed to facilitate your and your government's incompetence, to exempt it from the cut&hyphen;off. We were advised as such late on Friday. We gave the instruction to Dr Laing early this morning. She has to deal with the entire chamber's requests. We do not have loads of ministers and departmental advisers sitting around in the background to assist us. Your minister&mdash;and I guess you particularise that sort of attitude&mdash;has failed to consult with us once in months of this bill's presentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the chair, Senator Alston, fortunately that is typical of only some of your ministry. Other members of your ministry are quite capable of, and competent in, negotiating with and dealing with minor parties that have a resource situation and a stress situation that is totally unlike yours. So earlier this morning the final agreement on the amendments were given to Dr Laing, and it is not her fault that she has the workload she has. About 20 minutes to half an hour ago, they were finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston if you are not capable, sitting there with four advisers, of dealing with this issue then perhaps you should make way for somebody who can. I am sitting here alone with one adviser behind me and I can cope. The Greens sit there with one adviser behind them and they can cope. Senator Harradine, whom you smoodge over to, can cope. Through the chair, what is the matter with you that you cannot cope when you have four advisers? Senator Collins can cope; he has the experience to do so.</PARA>

I say to Senator Murray, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it is not the minister or me who are being inconvenienced; it is, rightly or wrongly, to all intents and purposes&mdash;this is the difficulty of it because there are three pages of these amendments&mdash;the Australian Democrats who are being inconvenienced. I have to say that I was getting somewhat agitated, not that it is my business, wondering where the Democrat amendments were. When I made my own inquiries I was told that they were coming. Senator Murray was originally listed as the second speaker and did not speak in that time slot. I assumed that that was because the amendments were being pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inconvenience is not with respect to the minister or to anyone else. It is that we have three pages of amendments. I may be minded to support most or indeed all of them but with respect to the chamber and the way we process legislation I am a little concerned about trying to do this on the run when we have only just been presented with them. If it was a single paragraph amendment it would be different, but there are three pages of them.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I apologise again to all parties within the Senate for the late circulation of these amendments. Amendment No. 1 is quite self&hyphen;explanatory, I think. It is an attempt to broaden the consideration by government of a number of issues which we think are essential to the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our belief that there is no substantial financial consequence to this, although many amendments will have a financial consequence. We have asked that the bill not commence until the day after which agreement has been reached between the Commonwealth and the states of South Australia and Tasmania on funding assistance for the development of rail infrastructure in those states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do that deliberately, because rail matters so much to those states that we feel that they have to move forward on the basis of certainty and of understanding what the arrangements are between the three governments. We hope that there would be a meeting of minds and they would be able to accelerate that approach, but we believe it is essential that that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of our amendment No. 1 refers to a labour market adjustment program being `implemented for the employees of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commission who have been made or are to be made redundant as a result of the sale or transfer of assets of the Commission.' My understanding, Minister, is that some of that process is already under way and it merely formalises what we would regard as good labour practice in those instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third section of the amendment asks that `the States of South Australia and Tasmania have enacted legislation in accordance with the Inter&hyphen;Governmental Agreement on Rail Safety', because we think that is an essential component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part of the amendment relates to those employees who have ceased to be employees of the commission since the announcement on 24 November 1996, not voluntarily but as a result of work related illness or injury. We believe that they should be included in a redundancy package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last amendment says that the trust deed of the Australian National principal scheme should have been altered `to allow full vesting of employer contributions to all employees who cease to be employees of the Commission or who have ceased to be employees of the Commission since 24 November 1996 . . . '</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recognise in there some of the elements of Labor's second reading amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not agree with these amendments. The first part relating to an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states of South Australia and Tasmania is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4907"> simply far too broad. Our commitment is to contribute in a financial sense to interstate arrangements but there is no commitment to provide funds in respect of intrastate infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as (b) is concerned, it is couched in very wide terms, so `a' labour market adjustment program really tells you nothing and you always have the nightmare of deciding precisely when it would come into effect or who makes the judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same goes, I think, for the states of South Australia and Tasmania enacting legislation. As far as `all persons who cease to be employees' being offered a redundancy payment is concerned, that again is something that is a matter for the commission, and it has indicated, I think, sympathy for that approach.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with the superannuation `full vesting of employer contributions', that is a matter for the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the principal concern has to be (1A)(a). We are committed to providing $20 million by way of a regional adjustment package to both South Australia and Tasmania. This effectively calls for us to go beyond that, and that simply cannot take place. But it would certainly be premature, given that the actual impact in regions is not yet clear and it is really asking for a blank cheque.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I really feel that the Senate is owed by the government some indication in respect of that particular matter.

I do feel that the committee would appreciate a more fulsome indication by the government as to what is likely to happen. I suppose it cannot say what the commission is going to do, but as I understand it the commission is going to consider this matter at its meeting this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the government may not be able, strictly speaking, to speak on behalf of the commission. Nevertheless, it ought to have a fairly good idea as to what the commission is likely to do and it ought to be able to tell the committee what is likely to occur.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment deletes proposed subsection A and simply leaves subsection B. This means that, in effect, the offer would be made to the Tasmanian government before a general offer for public sale to the private sector of Tasrail. That offer, moreover, would be on the same terms as is proposed to the private sector so that the Tasmanian government could consider taking back ownership of Tasrail and that ownership would be free of debt and encumbrance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important prospect for Tasmania. In Tasmania, both the government and the Labor opposition have not, to date, been keen to take back the ownership of Tasrail. Part of the problem there has been the prospect of the indebtedness and the need for continuing capital investment. But if the debt is taken away from Tasrail, on the figures I have&mdash;which show a $22 million income and outgo for the last year&mdash;there would be a further $5 million income over outgo, because the servicing of the debt would no longer be required. In other words, we have then a profitable concern with a considerable transfer of moneys from servicing debt to upgrading rolling stock and line. This makes it a very much more attractive proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that at least the offer should be made to the Tasmanian government first. I know the government will be considering taking on Tasrail with the ability it has to look at the wider public interest. If that fails, this amendment still allows for the government to then proceed to offer Tasrail to the private sector. So there it is: an offer to the Tasmanian government, then the possibility of private sector sale if that is not successful.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the government cannot support this amendment. The state government in Tasmania have made their position emphatically clear. It certainly would not in any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4909"> shape or form fit in with the approach they wish to pursue. They have seen what happens when there is government ownership and involvement and they are very keen indeed to have the private sector take its turn. There is no way this could work therefore we are opposed to it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that matter: that was presuming that Tasrail was going to revert to Tasmanian government ownership with the debt encumbrance and certainly not be transferred back to Tasmania, as this amendment would have it. Whatever the advisers might say about this, the fact is that the Greens, who hold the balance of power in Tasmania, are very strongly in favour of this. They are negotiating with the government. The government has not closed the door. The opportunity needs to be made available for this offer to be taken up or turned down by the Tasmanian government in light of this amendment, which has not been discussed in its final form with the Tasmanian government, passing the Senate. It would not get in the way of a sale to private enterprise if Tasmania turned down that option, but that option should be there. The government ought to offer that option. I am hoping to convince the committee that that offer ought to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that we are handing to Tasmania the option of Tasrail in a profitable circumstance, not in a money losing circumstance. That is what the government intends to do as far as private enterprise is concerned. In this situation, the Tasmanian government would take Tasrail and it would be able to put its profits in coming years of around $5 million&mdash;and I am being conservative in my estimate&mdash;into the continuing upgrade of the rail system and the rolling stock which has been under way for some years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Tasmanian government turns down that offer then it can go for sale to private enterprise. It is a two&hyphen;step option. If the minister believes that the Tasmanian government is not going to entertain this option then he should have no fear of it. In light of the amendment as it stands and the work that has been done to develop this option for Tasman 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ia, I recommend strongly to the committee that it should be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that it is a small system. It carries 16 per cent of the freight in Tasmania. It is basically a carrier of the resource extraction industries in Tasmania, but it is also important to small business. It is more important than ever as the shipping facilities are concentrated on the northern seaboard of Tasmania. A lot of the shipping that was once done out of Hobart is now being done out of the northern ports and therefore depends on either road or rail traffic. This rail option should be available in public ownership as a profitable enterprise, in the terms of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned that the track kilometerage be kept as is because there are sunrise options for the use of that track. In this age Tasmania's service industry, small businesses and design based industries are those which are providing the jobs and creating the economic stimulus in Tasmania. The old resource extraction industries are sadly losing jobs and are no longer the prospect for Tasmania that they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasrail is critical to the design of a different future for Tasmania. Tasrail in the hands of government becomes an instrument for redesigning Tasmania's away from the old age of hydro-industrialisation and job shedding heavy industry and towards the range of small business and sunrise industries of the future. Before the dinner suspension I spoke about the great mistake that was made when the Abt railway on the west coast was closed and how a consortium of people is now trying to raise $20 million to bring that railway back into being. Here we have the prospect of the whole of Tasrail being sold for $20 million, according to the lowest valuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am underlining the importance of giving the Tasmanian government this option to think about before we sell Tasrail across to private enterprise. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past but make Tasrail an option for the implementation of the prospective alternative industries that Tasmania has for the future, and as a profitable concern. In this legislation the government is offering it for sale as a profitable concern. Let us give it back to the people of Tasmania as a profitable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4910"> concern to upgrade the rolling stock and upgrade and realign the track to continue this as a profit making, stable employer and a fundamental part of Tasmania's strategic design for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

The fact is that the track cannot be ripped up or closed down. If that were to occur then the ownership reverts to the state. Expressions of interest were called for in April.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dry gulch. That would be worse than doing nothing. It would be to throw the whole process into disarray.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government can get itself into difficulties by pre-empting the passage of legislation through this parliament, but that is its fault. The Senate cannot be coerced by the fact that the government has decided that on the basis that it might get legislation through here it has proceeded towards the implementation of the outcome of that legislation as it wants it to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the business of the Tasmanian government having turned this down. I say that they have not. But even if they have, let me point out the reality of politics in Tasmania. The Labor Party and the Greens have the ability to put legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through the Tasmanian parliament if that is necessary. That puts the Tasmanian government in a very different situation. It does not, as a minority government, have the ability to take a cavalier approach to dismissing the sale, the acquiring of Tasrail in a profitable circumstance. It simply cannot do that. I can tell you that if we pass this amendment there will be legislation in the Tasmanian parliament to have it adopted. That will put the heat on the Tasmanian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the acceptance or otherwise of this offer in Tasmania is a long way from being a matter of dismissal by the government of the day, even if it did decide in the wake of an amendment here that that was its option. I put it to the Senate that we should allow this option. If the Tasmanian parliament turns it down, if the Tasmanian government is so short-sighted as to turn it down, so be it. Then we move over to the sale to private enterprise option, which is the government's base motive here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, let us put it back to the Tasmanian government and, indeed, to the Tasmanian parliament whether or not it will take Tasrail as a profitable enterprise with all the prospects that it has in front of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to pick up the minister on some of the statements he made about the Tasmanian government not regarding the potential profitability for Tasrail without the debt. It is interesting that, even if there were a sale with something like a $20 million price tag, anyone would consider it profitable or try to sell it if what the government is saying is that the Tasmanian government does not regard it as potentially profitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a rather odd thing to say, one would think, unless the government is planning to pay someone to take Tasrail away. It is potentially profitable if you put it on the market and expect at least $20 million. I do not know whether they are intending to run it down or would run it down if they were in that situation.

This seeks to avoid such a circumstance where any new employer, or even an old employer, could discontinue an apprenticeship contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of that amendment refers to existing passenger services and concession arrangements affected by the proposed sale or transfer to be continued for not less than five years after the date of sale or transfer. We recognise that that would impose a cost on government. We have not been able to do the costings to establish exactly what it is. But we are of the opinion that any private or public owner to whom sale or transfer has been made may struggle for a while to find their feet in terms of exactly how they will run the service and exactly how they will operate the service. Consequently, we think that existing customers, existing citizens serviced by AN, should continue to be looked after. So that is the purpose of the second part of amendment No. 9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the amendment styled 3A, on sheet 578, is to ensure that the right of first refusal is offered to any state, prior to the transfer or sale of any assets. In a sense, that mirrors but widens to all of Australia the intention of Senator Brown's amendment, which is simply to ensure that public ownership can be contemplated by states where their parliaments are of the opinion that that is appropriate. I need say no more than that, I think.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the genuine nature of Senator Murray's amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997. My purpose in rising very briefly tonight is to emphasise the need to get a resolution from both Houses, if amendments are going to be necessary, before the end of this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think few people really appreciate the run-down nature of the Tasmanian rail component of the Australian National Railways package. There is a degree of urgency. The staff levels are such that in many areas, in terms of the complement of people who are now running that service in Tasmania, there are specialist skills missing. If this drags on, I submit there may not be a railway to sell. The down&hyphen;sliding and degrading of operations are such that it is a major concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our state, of course, the Tasmanian railways are the major hauliers of bulk products&mdash;logs, cement, coal, and all those sorts of things&mdash;and our roads are just not up to that standard. So, while people might have agendas as to who should own what and what should happen, I would submit that time is of the urgency. While often in this chamber bluff and counter-bluff is part of the showmanship, part of the attempt to win, I would say that, if we want a railway in our state, we must make sure that we do not delay it too long, otherwise events might overtake us.</PARA></SPEECH>

As far as the Deomcrats' second amendment is concerned, for all the reasons that I advanced in relation to Senator Brown's amendment, together with the fact that this goes further&mdash;in other words, it really requires a direction in respect of the sale of any assets, not just the bulk quantity of assets, and it is also located within a state so it is more specific&mdash;it is not acceptable to either government, on my advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4913">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Senator Murray's amendment 9(a) is concerned, a working party has been formed to oversee the ongoing management of apprentices. Also, direct contact has been initiated with various group training schemes to identify alternative employment opportunities for apprentices. The new owner is expected to employ some, and there are a number of other employers and organisations who have indicated a willingness to take over the training of additional apprentices. I can assure the Senate that both Commonwealth and state governments will be seeking to ensure that young people who have not completed their apprenticeships will not be disadvantaged by the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of 9(b), passenger services and concessions, the sale of the passenger business to inject private sector expertise is expected to lower costs, to better meet the needs of travellers and to provide the best guarantee of continuing passenger services. Even so, my colleague the minister for transport has announced the government's intention to consider other options for the services, if AN's passenger business is not sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already provided $5.1 million for passenger concessions in the 1997-98 budget as well as similar allocations being provided in the forward estimates for this purpose.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is one of the most important amendments we have dealt with today, because one of the strongest criticisms we have of the government's approach to rail is that they have failed to develop and put before parliament and the people of Australia an integrated land transport strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We deliberately use the words `land transport strategy' because you cannot in a country of this size, with the diverse and sophisticated economy that it has, consider road and rail separately. They need to be considered together. They need to be considered in terms of their pricing, access, their taxation regime, integration, competition principles and many other considerations. It is for that reason that the Australian Democrats believe there should be an obligation on this government to put before the parliament and the people of Australia their view, their vision and their plans for a land transport regime in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our further view that that should include a process of public consultation. I have listened with great interest to many of the things that Senator Bob Collins has said in a number of committees over time about transport. I am of the opinion, having listened to arguments such as he puts and arguments such as we and the Greens put, that you would have strong cross-party support for a full consultation process to arrive at a land transport strategy which would do Australia proud as it goes into the 21st century. Accordingly, I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we commence debate on the appropriations legislation. It is traditional that the debate on appropriations deals with wide&hyphen;ranging matters that senators deem important, arising particularly from the budget strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I indicate that the Labor opposition in the Senate will be moving a second reading amendment that will contain a number of points. It will go to the issue of the 1997 budget and its doing nothing for jobs, which is currently the nation's most overwhelmingly important economic and social problem. The second aspect of the resolution will go to the squandering of a significant opportunity for this country to introduce a reasonable level of superannuation retirement savings, which was promised by Labor and also promised by the government, and which this government has failed to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the resolution will go to the continuing assault on families, the elderly and the needy. Fourthly, the resolution will draw attention to the mindless and counterproductive cuts affecting the quality and decency of life in Australia and harming our international reputation. Fifthly, it will deal with the cuts and their destructive impact, which do not meet the exaggerated expectations that the government has created in respect of the size of its deficit reduction and its projected future surpluses. Sixthly, it will deal with the general overall lack of shape, direction and vision in this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want firstly to make some comments in respect of unemployment and the lack of any significant focus on the creation of jobs in this last budget. What was immediately apparent from the budget speech was that unemployment rated only one mention. In contrast, if we read the section devoted to primary industry, we find that quarantine, which I would be the first to acknowledge is an important issue, rated five mentions. Unem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4916"> ployment rated one and that really did put into perspective the overall approach of this government to unemployment, job creation, industry policy and to various important regional initiatives that should be contained in a budget if we are to do anything about the increasing unemployment levels in this country. I know that was the first big failure in respect of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is the one of private saving and retirement incomes. The approach taken in this budget, as I have already mentioned, failed to deliver on the commitment of the government to 15 per cent contributions into superannuation, into retirement incomes. There are some important economic aspects related to this, which include a consequent increase in private saving, reducing our dependence on foreign investment and our ability to buy back the farm. The third theme, which is touched on in our second reading amendment, is that this budget does nothing for struggling families. In fact, in many areas it makes the plight of low income earners and the elderly particularly worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer, Mr Costello, predicted last year that he would bring the unemployment rate down to 8&frac14; per cent. Instead, it has risen to 8&frac34; per cent and it is still going higher&mdash;it was 8&frac34; per cent at the time of the budget. We have nearly 250,000 people in Australia who are now unemployed for the long term. The economic growth forecast for the next year, despite the pick&hyphen;up in the world economy, is projected to come in at just 3&frac34; per cent. That is still under the four&hyphen;plus per cent which Mr Howard and every other leading economic commentator accepts is necessary for unemployment reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another 16,500 Public Service jobs are likely to go in the coming year. As I referred to earlier, there are no job creation schemes worth the name, no restoration of the labour market programs which were savaged last year and which are so crucial for job readiness and skills training, no regional programs worth having and, just for good measure, a further squeeze on export promotion spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn in some detail to the issue of the so&hyphen;called `savings initiative' announced in the budget, and some issues 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> related to budget announcements on superannuation. Firstly, it is important in this context to draw to the attention of the Senate a problem that Australia shares with the rest of the world. An interesting report&mdash;an ABS survey of family trends in Australia&mdash;was released last Friday, I think it was. Amongst a range of significant social and economic statistical data, the report confirms the ageing of the population. I suppose it is obvious to all of us that we are getting older. As I look around the chamber the reaction of some of my colleagues makes that more than obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a deep&hyphen;seated concern and fear in the Australian community, and quite rightly so, about the ageing of our population and the consequences that will flow. I drew attention earlier to the ABS family data that was released last Friday. In 1986 just over 10 per cent of the population was over the age of 65&mdash;1.7 million people. In 1996 it was 12 per cent&mdash;2.3 million people&mdash;over the age of 65. It is projected that in the year 2021 17&half; per cent of the population will be over the age of 65. That is just over four million people. By the year 2051&mdash;even beyond my life expectancy&mdash;23 per cent, six million people, will be over the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia shares this trend with the rest of the world, albeit our population is not ageing as rapidly as the population in the rest of the world for a number of reasons, including the fact that we have had a significant migration program. This government's approach in that area will be interesting to see. It can only have one effect and that is a more rapid ageing of the population over the next 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the central failings in the budget was the failure to deliver on the committed retirement savings that were promised by Labor, and also by Mr Costello on a number of occasions prior to the last election and even prior to the delivery of this budget. In fact, he committed himself to the extent of delivering the financial commitment to retirement savings in the 1996 forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we get? Instead of the 15 per cent contribution, the government co&hyphen;contribution on top of the superannuation guarantee, what did we get? We had a repackaging of at least 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4917"> part of the funding that was supposed to be delivered into Australian workers' retirement incomes. It was repackaged in the form of a savings initiative that Mr Costello promised during the 1996 election campaign would `knock your socks off'. They were his words to describe what he intended to do with this savings initiative. The Treasurer has delivered on their savings policy that was announced in the election platform and funded it by failing to deliver at all on the three and three, known as the co&hyphen;contribution payments to Australian workers' superannuation. He has taken the money from that area, moved it over to a so&hyphen;called `savings rebate initiative' and for good measure thrown $1 billion of the money into a Federation Fund, a slush fund to celebrate Australia's Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is not against celebrating the federation of this country; it is a historically important event for this country. But is it worth $1 billion? Is it worth $1 billion effectively transferred out of Australian workers' retirement income? That again highlights the priorities of the government&mdash;failing to deliver to Australia's retirement incomes but delivering into a $1 billion fund to celebrate the centenary of this nation. When we look at the ageing population and the worrying economic and social problems that are going to result as a consequence of this, I know where Labor would much rather spend its money and that is in taking care of that significant economic and social problem and certainly not putting $1 billion into a federation slush fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings rebate initiative really knocked everyone's socks off because it disappeared almost overnight as far as the economic commentators were concerned, and deservedly so. In fact, I well recall the words of former Senator Stone, a former head of the Treasury. I did not have the `good fortune' to be in the Senate when he was a senator but I note that he commented that this savings initiative was bordering on irresponsible. It has been universally criticised&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;by a range of Australian commentators. In fact, it was hard to find one economic expert who had a good word to say about the so&hyphen;called savings initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Prosser will get it and, if it was not capped at $450, he would get it a number of times over. He would get it as a result of his existing investments. I have drawn to the attention of the chamber that we will all get it because we are contributing into a superannuation fund which is very generous, as we all know. We automatically get the $450 rebate as a consequence of our superannuation contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said to the chamber before, I am sure that, as a consequence, Senator McKiernan, Senator Foreman and my other colleagues are all going to dash out and boost their superannuation savings because of the incentivation of this $450 rebate that we are automatically going to get.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Incentive and choice get a very heavy run by this government and we well recall their attempt to reinvent the English language by introducing the word `incentivation'. They are attempting to reinvent the GST in order to at least provide some cover from the very poor response to the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get back to this savings initiative, even if you have $5,000 worth of non&hyphen;superannuation saving&mdash;and that is a very large sum for an ordinary working family&mdash;you get a tax rebate of&mdash;wait for it&mdash;72c a week. Most battling families in Australia just do not have the disposable income to save $5,000. In fact, all the statistics show that a significant proportion of people earning less than $35,000 are negative savers. They are up to their necks in credit card debt, and it is going to be a long time before they can collect the 72c a week if they accumulate $5,000 worth of saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the area of superannuation, if Australian workers put $1,000 a year into personal superannuation contributions, the rebate is worth $3 a week. This initiative is worth $3.7 billion over the next four years, and that is $3.7 billion that would have gone into the retirement incomes of ordinary working Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of the non&hyphen;payment of what was known as the government co&hyphen;contri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4918"> bution, a person in their mid&hyphen;30s on average weekly earnings will lose around $110,000 from their final retirement income package. This will be the result of the government's abandonment of this scheme. Not only that, in the budget paper savings document there is no modelling of the increase in private saving that will result from the so&hyphen;called savings rebate proposal. It is not a surprise to the Labor opposition that that modelling is not contained in the document because there will not be any increase in saving. In fact, there is a strong argument that there will be a decline in public and private saving because the cost of this measure to public saving will outweigh any net increase in private saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had in the budget was an acknowledgment that private saving will increase, not as a result of this rebate measure but as a result of Labor's superannuation guarantee. We will be pursuing the government ferociously on this issue of the lack of increase in private saving as a consequence of this rebate measure. It is economically irresponsible and it will reduce total private saving. At a time when we need a crucial injection of funds for investment, for creating jobs in Australia, for buying back the farm and for reducing our foreign debt, the government has initiated a policy which will not meet those very important economic criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of other extensive initiatives in the budget in relation to savings. I have touched on the savings rebate. There is also the issue of choice. `Choice' and `incentive' are the in buzz words for the government and particularly Mr Costello. We have over the last nine months seen a significant debate about the taxation of superannuation&mdash;the so&hyphen;called 15 per cent surcharge&mdash;and there will be a lot more to come once everyone starts getting letters from the tax office and from their funds notifying them that they have got to provide their tax file numbers or they will have to pay this new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not, frankly, seen anything yet in respect of the government's breach of its election commitment not to introduce new taxes. My prediction is that, when it comes to superannuation and the issue of choice, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government ain't seen nothing yet because this issue of choice holds some very significant problems&mdash;not just for employees but for employers&mdash;as to how choice is exercised. The eight million employees in this country will have to make an informed choice from five products. It will be interesting to see how Australian workers will cope with having to sit down and choose their investment vehicle and make choices about administration charges, fees and charges, returns on investment, et cetera. It will be just as interesting to see how employers handle this and I notice that already the Small Business Association is critical of this measure. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I know that some of them are highly embarrassed. That is sad enough in itself, but it is what the budget does to the community that is of real import in this debate. It is very disappointing that not one government senator, not one National Party senator and not one Liberal Party senator, other than the parliamentary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secretary, is going to rise to their feet and seek in some shape or form to defend what Mr Costello put forward in his statement last month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interjection came forward which I am happy to take: `They're probably watching the cricket.' I am certainly not watching the cricket, and the people on this side of the chamber are not watching the cricket. They are here participating in the debate on the budget, on the estimates of government expenditure for the next financial year. Why would they be watching the cricket? I suspect it has probably been  rained out anyway. None of us are lucky enough to be over there because the parliament is sitting. Why would we be over there watching the cricket? The cricket is taking place in another place. It is not here in Australia that such a thing is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on to some of the detail that is contained in the budget. To some extent Senator Sherry embarrassed me in his comments which preceded mine. Senator Sherry embarrassed me by talking about the savings rebate provided in the tax reduction. I as an individual am going to benefit, thanks to Mr Costello, to the tune of some $450 per year&mdash;indeed, every senator in this place is going to benefit by virtue of the fact that we are members of the parliamentary superannuation fund. Many of the people that we represent do not come anywhere near getting the benefit that is set out in that savings rebate. Senator Sherry quite rightly pointed out to the chamber Mr Costello's words when he brought down this particular so&hyphen;called initiative that was going to `knock the socks off' all of us. Indeed, it has knocked the socks off him because very few are talking about it now. I suggest that is one of the reasons no government senator&mdash;not one government senator, other than the parliamentary secretary in closing the debate&mdash;is going to debate this budget here in the Senate chamber tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry also made mention of the fact that whoever drafted the speech that Mr Costello made in the House of Representatives last month forgot about jobs&mdash;they  forgot to mention unemployment. They did 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4920"> mention it a couple of times at the beginning of the speech and again at the end of it, but there was no emphasis at all on jobs in Mr Costello's statement&mdash;no emphasis whatsoever. That is another reason the government ought to be embarrassed. Indeed, the government is embarrassed about the shape of their budget. Looking at the government's promises in last year's budget about jobs, they forecast an unemployment level of 8&half; per cent. Since then, they have had to revise that figure to 8&frac34;per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the figure coming down, the figure is going up. More and more Australians are now finding themselves out of a job. Perhaps the full impact of the budget that we are debating in this chamber tonight has not yet hit. But it is not doing very much for jobs, because what are we finding in the latest round of figures? Instead of it being the predicted 8.75 per cent, the figure of employment has now gone to 8.8 per cent nationally. It is on the increase. The greatest concern of all is the trends and where they are leading. The trends are going up. It does not appear that the government has any answers to that problem. As a matter of fact, it would appear that it is quite the reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this document that we are debating here tonight the government is quite openly stating that some 16,500 Public Service jobs are actually going to go&mdash;a further 16,500 public servants are going to lose their jobs under the initiative of this government. It is no wonder at all that the budget statement contained so little reference to the matter of jobs, to the matter of employment, of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be&mdash;or one had suspected that there might have been&mdash;some government senators who would get up in this place and defend the budget. I am bitterly disappointed that none of them has sought to do so. If they had, they would have sought to make some comparisons between what the state of affairs was when Labor was in office and what it is now in the area of the Australian economy. Well, they are not here for me to perhaps correct the record of misrepresentations that some of them might have sought to put down.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put a few statistics on the table before I get into some other substantive matters that I want to address in this wide ranging debate. The rate of growth in the Australian economy when Labor left office in March of last year was five per cent per annum. The current rate of growth under the coalition is now&mdash;annualised to the six months to December 1996&mdash;only 1.9 per cent. The average rate of growth in Labor's last term of office was 4.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average rate of employment growth in Labor's last term of office was 2.9 per cent. The average rate of employment growth in the coalition's first year of office&mdash;that is, to March of this year&mdash;is one per cent. The current rate of growth&mdash;and this is the really disturbing part of it&mdash;at April 1997 was zero per cent, no growth whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average number of jobs created each year in Labor's  last term of office was 225,000. The number of jobs created in the coalition's first year in office&mdash;that is, to March of this year&mdash;was only 90,000. The number of full&hyphen;time jobs created in Labor's last year in office was 110,600. The number of full&hyphen;time jobs lost in the coalition's first year in office, to March of this year, was 6,400. The number of full&hyphen;time jobs lost since the 1996 budget was 34,300.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the figures on unemployment before, but it is worth repeating them. The unemployment rate when Labor left office in March of last year was 8.5 per cent. In April of this year the rate was 8.7 per cent&mdash;a clear indication that things are getting worse for those people who do not have jobs. It is now, as I said, 8.8 per cent. The 8.7 per cent represents an increase in the number of unemployed people under the coalition government of 31,500 people&mdash;31,500 human beings. And there is not one government senator who is prepared to stand up in this chamber tonight and even seek to defend that appalling record. I have news for the government senators opposite. We will continue to raise this, not only in this place but outside where it really matters, out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further area on which I want to address some thoughts in tonight's contribution is within the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio. I am 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4921"> very disturbed that the Senate on 23 June 1997 does not know the details that will be contained in the agreements that will be entered into between the Commonwealth government and the governments of each of the states and territories on the matter of the delivery of legal aid services in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators would know that the agreements that are currently in place will expire&mdash;at midnight, I suspect&mdash;on 30 June, and a new regime will begin on 1 July 1997. What are the details of that new regime? I would like to be able to report them to this chamber here tonight, but unfortunately I am not able to, because the government have not released the detail. Despite rigorous questioning through a Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and later through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the government have kept the details secret. Why are they keeping them secret? That is a secret that they will not tell the parliament of Australia and they will not tell the people of Australia. Eventually, I suspect, the detail will come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other disturbing areas within the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio that I want to address some questions to. I would have liked not to have had to address these in a party political atmosphere, but by virtue of the response that was given to me by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), representing the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), to a question I asked here on 27 May this year on the matter of cuts to the Australian Federal Police, it has become a party political issue, or indeed a government&hyphen;opposition issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I addressed a question to Senator Vanstone relating to what was happening in Victoria and to comments by the Victorian Police Commissioner, Mr Comrie, who was reported to have stated that Victoria was awash with heroin, indicating that our barrier controls were not working. I questioned the minister as to why the government had cut $37.6 million from the budget of the Australian Federal Police over the last two years, with the latest cuts expected to see the loss of over 100 Fed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eral Police jobs. The minister very unkindly attributed some inappropriate comments to me in her attempt at responding to the question&mdash;attributions that I refuted in asking a supplementary question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my supplementary question I drew attention to the appalling situation that we find in Perth where young people are falling over from overdoses of heroin at the rate of one per week. They are overdosing on heroin which is readily and freely available in the streets of Perth and indeed in the surrounds of not only our high schools but also our primary schools, so much so that some individuals in the community want to have heroin free zones around our schools&mdash;an admission of defeat, in my opinion. Senator Vanstone, because I mentioned that, accused me of having a cheap shot. I was not intending to have a cheap shot and I do not intend to attempt to score any cheap shots here tonight. But I will persist,  because on Thursday of last week, 19 June, the front page headline in our newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, was, `Heroin kills boy in State hostel'. The article starts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old youth has died of a heroin overdose. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is bad enough in itself. It is even more appalling when you find out that that overdose occurred in a Justice Ministry halfway house in Bentley, a suburb of Perth. The situation in Perth at the moment is really disturbing, as I have been told it is in some other capital cities of Australia. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  goes on&mdash;I want to quote only small parts of it&mdash;to tell us that there were 1,701 drug overdose cases in Perth last year, 588 of which involved heroin. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first three months of this year, ambulance officers were called to 1,300 drug overdoses, putting Perth on track for more than 5,000 cases for the year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is appalling. Like it or not, governments&mdash;both at the state and the Commonwealth level&mdash;have to accept some responsibility for those appalling statistics. The Western Australian government tell us that they are seeking to address the problem. They have set up a parliamentary committee to look at it. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4922"> Only last week, on Thursday and Friday, did we find that the chairman of the parliamentary committee and the Premier have got different views about what the parliamentary committee is about. The Premier states that it is a wide inquiry. The chairman&mdash;a part-time parliamentarian&mdash;said that it had very narrow terms of reference. We find out today that the terms of reference are going to be broad. The Premier has obviously pulled the chairman into line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman is Mr Chris Baker, the member for Joondalup in Perth's northern suburbs. A couple of weeks ago it was reported in the same newspaper that he was a part&hyphen;time lawyer running his own business at the same time as being a parliamentarian on quite a reasonable salary, which is going to be benefited by this $450 savings rebate that has been announced in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way in the world that governments should be cutting the funds to law enforcement officers when statistics such as those that I have been reporting to the chamber are about. Last year the funds to the National Crime Authority were slashed. The authority has got huge problems in carrying out its day-to-day functioning. Last year it was cut by $11.3 million over three years. But this year there was some increase; they got some of the money back, but not all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to put on the record that things are not all bad. The NCA have had some victory. Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported that 15 kilograms of heroin, said to be worth about $15 million, had been seized. I commend the NCA for that and indeed commend all law enforcement officers right around Australia for what they are doing to protect the people of Australia, especially the youth, from the insidious drug addictions that many of our young people are afflicted with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the debate on the appropriation bills I want to speak on the issue of process&mdash;a subject that is of absolute importance to the fairness with which this society is conducted, to the justice that is administered, to the way our laws are made and to the wellbeing of society as a whole. What I mean by process 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is the machinery that is put into operation and the way that machinery is put into operation that is necessary for us to produce our laws, our government and indeed anything that is worthwhile in our community. The board of a private company, for example, must go through proper process to see that the shareholders are properly dealt with. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, as chair of a very important committee that deals with corporations in this place, would know the importance of this process to the proper administration of any company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal first of all with the process that goes on within parliament itself. One of the great problems we face as a parliament is that the executive has ascendancy over the parliamentary process, which is not good. I want to deal with that. I think there is insufficient protest on the part of parliamentarians to stand up to executive power. I mention in that context that Senator O'Chee, the chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, is in the house. He has the conviction and the courage that enables him and his committee, which is a very good committee, to stand up to the excessive use of power by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter what party is in power, the same problem will be there. The task of ministers remains much the same no matter what their political colour. Whether the person who is leading a department is from the ranks of the coalition or the Labor Party, he or she must see to its good administration and the same sorts of pressures are brought to bear on him or her. Often during estimates a minister, no matter from what party he or she comes, will say, `The particular party you belong to, Mr Questioner,'&mdash;Miss Questioner, Mrs Questioner or Ms Questioner&mdash;`did much the same sort of thing or something worse.' That does not seem to me to be a proper answer to the proposition that has been put. Ministerial problems ought to be teased out. There is executive power that must be restrained. They are the issues, not what colour party the questioner is from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the Baxter report has been accepted by the government. That report contains recommendations which will affect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4923"> the departments that directly affect us as senators and our colleagues in the House of Representatives. There is no need for me to go into this in any detail because everybody here knows about it. There are now five departments. As far as we can understand, there is a suggestion that they be rationalised, which is the word that is used these days to indicate that there are going to be changes and that things are to be brought down to lower levels, at least in terms of numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is that, as far as I know&mdash;and I stand to be corrected&mdash;the President, the Speaker and the clerks do not know what those recommendations are. I do not know and, as far as I understand it, no parliamentarian knows what is in those recommendations. It seems to me extraordinary that a plan, a report, a program should be discussed and perhaps agreed upon without any effective input from the people it is going to affect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem in this case is that it is parliament that will be affected. The parliament is the one body in Australia that is elected by all people of voting age. It is the one body that everybody in Australia votes for. They do not vote for the government. They vote for the members of parliament. Depending on the combination of numbers that are so returned, the executive is elected. In some cases, members of the executive are elected by members of that parliament and in others they are appointed by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary that a body like the parliament should not be master of its own destiny. That is a very worrying feature in this regard. It is the driving force for seeing that proper process is administered and the running of the country and the government is properly checked. It seems to me quite extraordinary that the executive, the creation of this elected body, this parliament, should dictate to the parliament what should go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The symbolism of that is very bad. It bears out the sort of thing that Justice Brennan, Chief Justice of the High Court, said when he was a justice of the High Court. When he delivered a lecture to the Law Society of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Capital Territory on 7 August 1990 he said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The theory of responsible government which made the fate of an Executive Government dependent upon the confidence of the Parliament was, so to speak, turned on its head by the political dependence of the majority members of the Parliament on the Executive Government. Policy formulation became primarily an executive function. As the pressure on legislative time intensified, a virtual monopoly over initiatives for legislation passed to the Executive Government. The influence of Ministers in debate, whether in the party room or in Parliament, was enhanced by the support they could command from the public service. These developments virtually destroyed the Diceyan theory.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A little later His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the wind of political expediency now chills Parliament's willingness to impose checks on the Executive and the Executive now has a large measure of control over legislation, the courts alone retain their original function of standing between government and the governed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what happens when parliament does not exert the sort of force that it should. The parliament takes it up and then you get the unfortunate situation that you now have when people criticise the courts and, in my view, quite unfairly take the High Court to task. The High Court must carry out its function. That function is made much more difficult because the parliament does not exert itself as it should. Here is the latest example where you have a suggestion that the support that is to be given to parliament is to be arranged in a way that is to be decided by government without, it seems, any effective input from the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if the departments running the parliament were not running well, that would be bad enough. But when you look at the outstanding service that is given in this place by a variety of departments&mdash;including Hansard, who makes sense of what is otherwise a fairly doubtful system of English expression that a lot of us use in this place, and the people who give us security and attend upon our needs&mdash;it is even more amazing that we should be in a position to give away that ability to control our own destiny. If the administration of those services that are needed to make this place run properly are put outside of it, then we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4924"> lose control. The immediacy of service is what is needed and what we should insist upon having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are paid well. When I say `well' I mean that we are paid well in every sense&mdash;we get generous allowances. But we are also paid by people who are attendant to our needs, who make sure things are kept in order and happen on time. People who run the committees are quite outstanding, and so it goes on. In the context of the appropriation debates, I would like to emphasise the need for us, as parliamentarians, to keep control of our services and at the same time pay tribute to the very good services we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our problem is the fact that we are in parties. That is only proper and right. I think Edmund Burke said that if you were not a party person you did not have any proper political beliefs. That may well be so, but I think running parallel to that, in any event, is the proposition that if it is proper and if it is right that we operate as a parliament then we should fill that demand. I think there are ways in which that can be done. As I said, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is one example of that and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is another. It is something that we ought to have regard to. William Blackstone, when he was writing on the English constitution in 1765, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is highly necessary for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the executive power be a branch, though not the whole of the legislative. The total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny; the total disjunction of them, for the present, would in the end produce the same effects, by causing that union against which it seems to provide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was saying that there is a proper place for the executive and a proper place for the parliament and the balance between the two should be attended to. I am not sure whether that it is being attended to at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue of process that I want to talk about, and it is this: there has been much debate about the legal proceedings in which Mr Elliott and others have been involved. I do not want to go into the rights and wrongs of that debate except in so far as it concerns the court before which those pro 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ceedings were taken, the Supreme Court of Victoria, constituted by Justice Vincent. There has been some inference at least that he was not as ready for the task as he should have been. That is absolutely wrong. He is an outstanding judge and applied the law as it should be applied. I am a person that admires the National Crime Authority. I think it has done great work over the years. It has been headed by some outstanding people and the present person heading it is certainly of outstanding ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People go on trial. Some are acquitted and some are convicted. That is done according to the process. The result is not the issue, but the process is. On this occasion, Mr Justice Vincent saw that the process had not been carried out in accordance with the law. That is no criticism of the National Crime Authority. It simply means that, on the facts before the judge, a particular outcome developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to read a quotation from the judgment of Pearse v. Pearse. That explains it much better than I can. This sets out the sort of philosophy that is contained in cases like Ridgeway, which we have dealt with in this place. The judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise than advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against the solicitor, who, in the cause between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton, had acted or proposed to act in the manner which Lord Eldon though it right to prohibit. Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely&mdash;may be pursued too keenly&mdash;may cost too much.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is certainly a most eloquent description of what process, in this case in terms of the law, is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that a judicial tribunal in proper accordance with the law allowed or disallowed certain evidence does not go to the issue of whether he is a good or bad judge. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4925"> The issue is whether or not he applied the law correctly&mdash;and, in this case, Mr Justice Vincent certainly did that&mdash;and upheld in the highest tradition that great philosophy of the law which has served us so well in this country and which served England&mdash;the place we got it from&mdash;so well before that.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think you should be laughing over there given your government's record on defence contracts. I would like to point out that fact&mdash;that the previous government did not deliver, Senator Bishop, on this matter. The Prime Minister, John Howard, has now finalised negotiations on the lead&hyphen;in fighter contract with British Aerospace. This was widely reported not only in England but also in Australia. That is considerably important because the people in the Labor Party in our area have been talking down the region for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted tonight to see on the ABC news a five&hyphen;minute feature of this particular proposal. The feature showed the Prime Minister in the base in the north of England. It showed models of what was going to be built in Newcastle. It showed&mdash;and this is the important thing that has happened this week&mdash;that the Prime Minister has finalised this contract and the contract is now ready to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sign. Up to the present, the contract going ahead was subject to signing. As we know, in any commercial arrangement, it is not until you get people signing on the bottom line that it is secured. The project could have been lost at any point in time up to now to the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has sealed the deal in the north of England. This is something which Labor, throughout its 13 years of government, was totally unable to achieve for the Hunter. Throughout the 80s and 90s we were constantly let down, usually due to Labor deals with different states. There was a need to prop up the Bannon government in Adelaide, so the submarines went to Adelaide. There was a need to prop up the Kirner government in Victoria, so the Anzac frigates went to Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Newcastle could not even take a trick with a smaller operation, like the marine sea safety centre. Under Labor, that was lost to, of all places, Canberra, which is over 100 kilometres from the sea. We have a sea safety centre on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin; one would have thought coastal Australia would have been a more appropriate location. I am delighted to inform the Senate that this Liberal government, due to the efforts of a number of people, including my colleague Bob Baldwin, MHR for Paterson, has been able to deliver on this project, whereas previous ALP members in the area, like Peter Morris and Bob Brown, have failed dismally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to outline some aspects of this very vital defence contract that is coming to the Hunter. The Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, and British Aerospace officials will tomorrow sign the contract for the lead&hyphen;in fighter project. Thirty&hyphen;three Hawk 100 lead&hyphen;in fighter training aircraft will be provided under this contract, and they will be replacing the ageing Italian Macchi trainer fleet. This new fleet of lead&hyphen;in fighters will commence service in the year 2000, and they will have a service operation life of 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is great news also for the Hunter, because the maintenance projects will take place over those 25 years in the Hunter. There will be work on construction commencing in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4926"> September 1998; there will be $850 million spent on the project; there will be 130 workers employed during the construction phase of the project; and there will be 150 people employed during the building of this series of planes in the Hunter Valley. The majority of the planes&mdash;21 of the 33&mdash;will be built in the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project is coming on line at a time when BHP is starting to phase down in the area. The phase-down over 1998-99 will be replaced with a number of things. Already Warwick Parer has been to the Hunter and announced the coal projects that are about to come on stream in the next two years. Now this week under this government we find further good news for the Hunter, as this government signs this contract and brings the region even more work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing about this type of work is: it helps to build a new base for the Hunter Valley. We have been a coal and steel based economy. What has happened now with a number of projects is that we are starting to move towards the aerospace industry and have in train a number of high-tech defence contracts, the lead&hyphen;in fighter project being the latest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Maurie Rudd, who is the leader of the AWU in Newcastle, says that there are many BHP workers who will have the skills to take up these jobs, particularly in the construction phase. Also, my colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone was in Newcastle two weeks ago announcing retraining money for industries to take up from BHP people who have certain metal and technical skills and convert them into employees for other industries that are successful in the Hunter at this stage. This sort of project could be extended to include people for retraining out of BHP into work in high tech defence industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be ongoing employment from this work over a period of 25 years. The announcements made by the Prime Minister in the UK will have a very positive effect on the Hunter. The Prime Minister has put the area of Newcastle and the Hunter on the world stage as a region capable of doing vital defence contract work. The PM has virtually shouted from the rooftops that the area of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Newcastle and the Hunter is being repositioned as a hub and centre for high-tech defence industry. Above all, the PM has responded to the closure by late 1999 of BHP in Newcastle with some real projects that will take the region forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision is a cornerstone of the commitment of actually repositioning the Hunter economy. To the people of the region, it looks and sounds more credible than Labor's rear&hyphen;vision approach and demands that BHP stay in the steel industry. The ALP's approach to this matter, I feel, has been absolutely disgraceful; it has been backward&hyphen;looking. It has not been useful for the city, and it has not helped develop the image of the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what this government is doing is positioning the Hunter to move forward to the next era of industrial development, which is in defence and high-tech industries. I commend the government for this decision. It is endorsing the Hunter as a very vital part of Australia's industrial infrastructure in regional Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4926"><TITLE>Health: Women</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to speak about the issue of women's health. We on this side of politics are very concerned about the fact that the national women's health program is being systematically dismantled. This is of great concern to women throughout Australia. But tonight, I want to focus on another issue. It is an issue often avoided by many parliamentarians&mdash;particularly, I have to say, male parliamentarians. So I am hoping the four male parliamentarians who are at present in the chamber will listen very fairly carefully to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue relates to a headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> entitled `Horan welcomes abortion clampdown plan'. I am referring to the Queensland health minister, Mike Horan. Surely only a male minister could make such a statement. I would like to go through some of the things he has said. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health Minister Mike Horan yesterday said he hoped the number of abortions performed in Queensland would be "dramatically reduced" and abortion clinics shut down through a Federal Government committee proposal. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4927">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know how he expects to do this when he is not prepared to put funding into sex education, or family planning, or children by choice. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Horan said the proposal that abortions be performed only in public and private hospitals could lead to abortions becoming "a rarity" and stop Queensland laws being flouted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, I do not know whom Mr Horan talks to. It is well known, and a recent National Health and Medical Research Council report revealed, that one in four Australian women face an unwanted pregnancy at some stage in their reproductive lives. That is a fact, and I do not know how Mr Horan thinks he can dismiss this reality. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Horan said he would establish a ministerial advisory committee comprising medical specialists and administrators to consider the federal report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no mention of consumers, no mention of women; just medical specialists and administrators. I would have thought he might consult with consumers. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If the federal proposal leads to a system where abortion, in the overwhelming majority of cases, stops, we are interested," he said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is all very well in politics to make grand statements that you think a section of the electorate may agree with. I respect that there are many people in the electorate who do not agree with abortion. That is their choice and their right to have that view. I respect that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I equally respect the view of those women who, when faced with an unwanted pregnancy, choose the option of termination. Women, in consultation with their partners, in consultation with their doctors, should have that right to choose. Every opinion poll conducted in the last 10 years or so has shown an increasing number of people&mdash;men and women, rural and city voters&mdash;who believe that this is the case. It is similar to the debate we had in relation to another sensitive issue about differences in opinion relating to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of women's right to have access to safe termination of pregnancy is one that I feel very strongly about. Many years ago in Tasmania a friend of mine only had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to a backyard abortion and that ended with tragic results. She was never able to bear children. Another case at the same time was that of a young woman who tragically died. I do not want to see my daughters or anybody else's daughters go through the experience of being forced to go to unsafe, unhygienic backyard abortionists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a minister who is responsible for health. Let us face it: women's reproduction is a health issue. It is not a question of moralising. It is a question of personal choice and a question of each individual being free to make those decisions in a safe, hygienic environment. I respect the right of people who have different views from my own to have their choice. It is important that they equally respect those women who have a different attitude to termination of pregnancy to have that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to Minister Newman, who has made her views very clear on this subject. I praised her privately at the time, and I now publicly praise her for her stance in relation to women's rights in this matter. I think the time is coming when women in this place and women around Australia will have to say some fairly straightforward things to some men in the community and some men both in this chamber and the other chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask men who are uncertain about debating the termination of pregnancy to ask themselves two questions. First of all: how many unwanted pregnancies have I personally been responsible for? I do not want to know the answer to that question. That is a personal question for men. I would not dream of asking them that question because it is a personal matter. It is in the private domain. Before male parliamentarians in this place presume to make decisions for women, they should ask themselves that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question I think they should ask themselves is: how many women in my family, how many of my staff, how many of my friends, my constituents and my colleagues have had to face an unwanted pregnancy in the last six months, 12 months, five years or 10 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a normal part of living for one in four women throughout Australia. It is time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4928"> we stopped moralising about a matter that is facing women and their partners and their families and their doctors every day of the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, whenever you try to talk about women's reproductive rights, women's access to reasonable and safe health services in regard to termination of pregnancy, if that is their choice, I am afraid too many men in parliaments&mdash;and, let us face it, there is still an overwhelming monopoly of decision making by men throughout Australia and, indeed, throughout the world&mdash;say, `Oh, no, I don't want to talk about abortion. Oh, no, I don't approve.' If they don't approve, if that is part of their religious belief, that is entirely their choice. But I ask those two questions not to be cheeky, not to be rude, not to try to put any individual on the spot, but simply to say that unplanned pregnancy is a fact of life. Men and women have a responsibility in this regard, and too often it has been the women who have had to cope with unwanted pregnancy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to an article that appeared in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> , my home town paper, on Saturday, which was written by Mr Phillip Coorey. His article was about Dr Robert Weber, formerly the chief executive of the multifunction polis's Australia-Asia business consortium. In relation to Mr Weber, the journalist said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The highest paid public servant in South Australia&mdash;who received almost $1 million in salary and benefits from the multifunction polis in less than three years&mdash;has quit and left the country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The consortium is estimated to have cost South Australian taxpayers millions of dollars. This is no small amount of money and would have funded, and still could fund, significant and much needed projects directed at research and development relevant to South Australian business and industry. In fact, the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics on the future of the MFP recommended that further 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding to the MFP site be terminated. Perhaps this offers us one way of ameliorating to some degree the plight that higher education and research institutions are in at the moment; that is, if we were to redirect some of that funding where it is badly needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multifunction polis was an idea hatched in 1987 by the Japanese government with the assistance of former Senator John Button. The previous Labor government cut funding to universities and to research institutions, such as CSIRO and various universities, yet vigorously promoted the MFP as the leader in the development of international science and technology. From the very beginning, that particular proposal was criticised by the Australian Democrats as well as a number of key and leading academics. One of the principal grounds for that criticism was that the MFP was using resources that should have been spent on both basic and applied research within Australian universities and other research institutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the very beginning, in many respects the MFP was a fairyland, and any suggestion to this effect to government ministers at the time by the Australian Democrats and others was met with derision. The former government, in fact, maintained at the beginning that no government funding would be spent on the MFP. It was to be privately driven. But, for 10 years now, both the federal government and the South Australian governments have poured money into what can only be described as a face-saving exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early years, the federal government maintained that the MFP would be the largest development ever undertaken in this country and that, by concentrating resources into the MFP, this facility would stimulate Australian industry and the economy. At that time, I might add, many coalition senators thought the MFP was a mirage. Unfortunately, they did not support the attempts by my predecessor, Senator John Coulter, when he moved amendments in appropriation debates back in November 1991; that is, that the roughly $4 million allocated by the government in that budget to the MFP be removed. His motion was not supported by the opposition at the time. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4929">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the original MFP document, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry included a proposal to build a 2.1&hyphen;kilometre high mountain with a runway for launching linear rocket vehicles into orbit. Both federal and state governments, including the South Australian government, have spent considerable sums trying to convince the public that the always ill-defined MFP was a profitable and productive way to spend the public's taxes. In fact, I recall that it held a number of expensive conferences, costing something like $1,000 for two days. That was on one particular occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Bannon government in South Australia spent $150,000 on a public relations firm to convince South Australians and other taxpayers of the particular worth of the MFP. It employed several chief executive officers, and now the latest million-dollar man has quit without achieving his stated goals, leaving behind a program which spent $2.2 million of taxpayers' money in 1994-95 and 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's achievements were a tour of Malaysia, which failed to sign up any businesses, and an intention to join two university business schools and do some planning. So it is really remarkable now how unwilling governments, politicians and many bureaucrats are to admit that they have made a mistake and how a lot of public money has, in fact, been spent on defending the indefensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few years, two projects have been promoted as the achievements of the multifunction polis: the cleaning up of the polluted Gillman site and the building of a group of energy efficient and novel energy technology&hyphen;using houses in North Haven. The Gillman site was a success, but it did not require the expensive backing of the MFP. This site is now suitable only as a sink for northern Adelaide's storm waters. Several university departments, together with soil engineers and a few earth movers, would have had the same effect and, of course, much more cheaply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the two houses in North Haven, they are not a serious attempt to address the urgent need to develop more energy efficient housing for Australian conditions. Firstly, the houses 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were not built by the MFP but by a private builder. Not one has eaves to protect the walls from heat gain or loss, and solar water heating is absent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One house has a geothermal heating and cooling system that circulates water through a deep pipe underground and, inside the house, uses this constant&hyphen;temperature water as a heat sink for a reverse cycle refrigeration system to heat and cool the house. This system is unusual in Australia and may not hold promise of more energy&hyphen; and cost&hyphen;efficient housing. To find out, it would be necessary to monitor over a year or more every aspect of the energetics and economics of the system. But no monitoring equipment has been fitted into this unit and there has been no analysis of energy saving. This is simply window&hyphen;dressing for the uninformed and the uninitiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the report by the Bureau of Industry Economics recommending that funding to the MFP be terminated, the failure of the MFP to deliver any of its promised benefits and the considerable employment cost with no identifiable benefits, it is time in light of all these concerns for the government to realise the mistakes that have been made&mdash;in part by its predecessor, and I do acknowledge that&mdash;and to divert any funding that might otherwise go or have gone to the MFP to our universities and to institutions such as the CSIRO. These are the organisations that can deliver on the research and development necessary for the future wellbeing of this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4929"><TITLE>Australian National University: Student Association</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, I can understand the concern of the Labor Party because their people were directly implicated and involved in this matter and, when they hear the contribution I am making 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4930"> this evening, they will see that the suspicions previously stated now appear to have been confirmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised this matter on two previous occasions, on 3 October 1996 and on 5 February this year. In my contribution on 5 February this year, I made the suggestion that it would be appropriate for handwriting experts to be called in to determine the link between certain individuals' handwriting and ascertain who in fact was responsible for what has now been determined an attempted fraud of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have followed this saga would be aware that 146 ballot papers were spirited into the ballot box without having been appropriately cast by individual students. The attempt to put the wad of ballot papers into the ballot box was found out, and the scandal has now been referred to as `Wadgate' because of the wad of ballot papers that were found. The papers were all neatly folded together in one big wad, and when the ballot box was opened it was found that the ballot papers were still together so they were able to be quarantined from all the other votes that were cast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so, they were able to be kept and my suggestion of 5 February this year has now been taken up. I have been advised that handwriting experts were called in and that a positive identification has now been made, according to my source, with a Mr Daniel Jenkins the person who was found to have committed the fraud in any event. I understand that this is a huge development in this case. I understand from my source that the testing has been done by an eyesight test and also by pressure tests, and that the conclusion of the experts is that it is a very distinct handwriting and there is nothing to convince them that it is not different from the person who was suspected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can indicate that this handwriting analysis was not undertaken as part of a police investigation. However, having said that, I know that the ACT Attorney&hyphen;General has written to the Australian Federal Police asking them to inquire into this matter. I understand that in recent times the Australian Federal Police have accepted the suggestion and will now be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undertaking their own investigations into this fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise these matters in the context of the people and persons involved, and it is quite clear that all 146 of these ballots were cast for the Labor Party candidate for the post of president of the student association. It appears that at least some others were involved but who we are not sure of. Nevertheless, it was designed to gain an election result and to pervert the course of democracy. Of the people involved in this, I note that Mr Jenkins rejoices in the title of vice&hyphen;president of the Labor Club on the ANU campus. So, despite having been found to have committed this fraud on his fellow students, he remains as vice&hyphen;president of the Labor Club and was being promoted as such on campus during the orientation week early this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this same group of students that is now trying to promote the affiliation of the ANU with the National Union of Students. I simply want to say this evening to the students at the ANU, `Be very careful of those people promoting affiliation with the National Union of Students.' When you consider the lengths to which they are prepared to go to effect a local student election result, one wonders what they would be prepared to do to gain effective control of the National Union of Students, which undoubtedly is an organisation that plays on a bigger stage, has more money, has more power and would be seen as an even greater stepping stone for those seeking to embark upon a political career. I would say to the students at the ANU that they would be well served by remaining out of the National Union of Students. Indeed, a former National Union of Students executive member, Mr Brad Woods, said on 8 August 1992 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . NUS has an appalling history of fraud and failure. It has funded left wing extremist causes and violent demonstrations.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  Higher Education Supplement of 10 January 1996 told us that the ALP, and the unity faction in particular, dominated the NUS. Mr Jenkins, as I understand, is a member of the ALP unity faction. So it appears that since Mr Woods made his comments in 1992 not much has changed within the political culture of those who support the National 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4931"> Union of Students and who are seeking to have the student body at the Australian National University affiliated with the National Union of Students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to be hoped that this matter will proceed further, with the ALP taking some responsibility in seeking to discipline Mr Jenkins, and also that the university administration will take the matter further. It seems unfortunate that the university has not been prepared to involve itself to the extent that it should. I compliment those who were involved in having the ballot papers analysed with another sample of handwriting to ascertain the author of the signatures on the back of the ballot papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is a very sad and sorry reflection on elements within the student movement at the ANU that, first, they engage in this sort of behaviour and, second, that the person involved in that sort of behaviour is allowed to continue as a vice&hyphen;president of the Labor club on campus and that that same organisation is shamelessly now promoting the National Union of Students on campus as the way to go for students. It is quite obvious that the motivation of these individuals is shamelessly selfish; that they want to gain their political careers and gain access to the bigger student stage&mdash;but, of course, at student expense. Their motivation has been exposed by their involvement in this fraud and their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inability or unwillingness to take any suitable and appropriate action to deal with that fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased this evening to be able to indicate that my suggestion of handwriting analysis has been taken up and that the results that I have indicated tonight have come forward. I am also pleased to have been told that the Australian Federal Police are investigating the matter. The only thing that remains to be said is that the students at the Australian National University would be very well served to steer clear of the National Union of Students, especially those elements promoting affiliation, who have been involved in such scandalous conduct.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.25 p.m." PAGE="4931"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.25 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
