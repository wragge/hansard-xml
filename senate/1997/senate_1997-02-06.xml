<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being, members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from The Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated, `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational service was ` July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their country on active service overseas.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator Calvert</NAME><FROM>(from 33 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>
<PETITION PAGE="224" TOTAL.SIGNED="5" PRESENTERS="Childs, Sen Bruce" NAMEIDS="IF4"><TITLE>Repatriation Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="225"> eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>

I am not making a very partisan comment here, but I think the ball has now been dropped on two occasions. I appreciate there may be reasons for that, but I urge the government to get its act together on this. Yesterday, I had to cancel a meeting because I was informed legislation was coming before the Senate. Having marched people out of my office, I found that, in fact, a different bill was being brought forward for debate. I do not think that is good enough.</PARA>

What we&mdash;and, I think, all parties in the Senate&mdash;require, and what is ordinarily the case, is some consultation about these changes.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This relates, I presume, to the additional information received&mdash;volume 5 of the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee&mdash;concerning questions placed on notice in October last year. Frankly, the estimates processes have revealed just how deplorable the state of affairs is within the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We have seen that this government has embarked upon a policy to reduce outlays for this department in terms of overall government expenditure from about 11 per cent of whole of govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="234"> ment expenditure to nine per cent in the forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In practice, what that means is that, for schools, universities and employment programs, there has to be a remarkable, dramatic drop in the level of service provided by the Commonwealth to the Australian people. We see in today's newspaper the impact of that in terms of the Australian National Training Authority. I noticed the answers to questions have been highlighted here. The government has now run into great difficulty in trying to administer these cuts in a manner where they are seeking to hide the true impact of the cuts from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For school students in Victoria, the Victorian education department has highlighted, through the arrangements made last December, that independent school students will get the equivalent of about $1,700 each from Commonwealth government vocational studies, but state school students will get only $300 each for vocational studies. That is the way in which programs are being administered, and the impact in terms of vocational education and training is a decline in expenditure totaling some $137 million over the forward estimates period. That directly relates and impacts upon the services provided by the Commonwealth for students, for Australian citizens throughout this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state in particular there are a whole series of measures now being undertaken to disproportionately allocate funds for private schools and private interests in particular and a slow, creeping privatisation of the functions of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in such a manner as to provide a disproportionate share of resources to private interests. So we see the downgrading of the public education system and the downgrading of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for the public sector in this country. That will have long&hyphen;term detrimental impacts on the economy and culture of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just about the economic impact; it is the social impact that I am fearful of. I am concerned that the Australian National Training Authority has sought, of course under government direction, to distribute moneys in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such a way as to give unfair advantage to private interests and private schools in particular. That could be no better expressed than in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> this morning entitled `School Funding Gap Revealed'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Export Control (Hardwood Woodchips) (Monitoring Fee) Orders (Amendment), Order No. HW1 of 1996, made under regulation 3 of the Export Control (Orders) Regulations, made under the Export Control Act 1982, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the information of the Senate, the effect of the change to regulations which the government has before the Senate is to reduce the levy on export woodchips which is raised in order to fund the woodchip export monitoring unit, otherwise known as WEMU. The woodchip export monitoring unit was established because of the now two decades old controversy over the environmental impact on forests in four states of Australia by the export woodchip industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unit was set up in 1995 under the Labor government. It was funded by a 12.6c levy on each green tonne of woodchips being exported out of the country. The aim was to raise $660,000 a year to fund WEMU. The woodchip export monitoring unit's function is to ensure that, amongst other things, the environmental safeguards which governments at a state and federal level want put in place will in fact be carried out. But the reality is that, in the two years of its functioning, the woodchip export monitoring unit, despite that funding, has not been able to carry out the task set for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the basic reasons that it has not been able to carry out the task is that it is underfunded. It has only two staff. Those two staff have not had on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground experience with forestry matters. They certainly have not been personally involved in the conservation issues raised in Victoria, New South Wales, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="235"> Tasmania, Western Australia and which potentially will be raised in Queensland now that the government has decided that export woodchipping from Queensland will be allowed to proceed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of this unit, which is integral to the monitoring of this most contentious of environmental issues for the whole nation of Australia, needs to be increased. It needs to have a much bigger staff allocation and, above all things, it needs to become visible in the job of monitoring export woodchipping in a way that it has failed to do so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, instead of increasing the minuscule levy that is on export woodchipping to facilitate WEMU being properly able to do its job, the Senate has before it a change in regulations that would actually decrease the amount of money. What is proposed is that the levy be decreased from 12.6c a unit to 11.2c a unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the government has already issued licences for 6&frac14; million tonnes of export woodchips to come out of Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia destined for Northern Hemisphere countries, principally Japan.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you do the calculations on that almost unprecedented level of export woodchips coming out of our native forest, you find that it can be expected that, under the existing very tiny levy, $787,000 would be raised. Under the levy proposed by this change in regulations, only $700,000 would be raised. In effect, the government is cutting the revenue expected from this levy by $88,000 this year. I submit to the Senate very strongly indeed that there needs to be a five or tenfold increase in the levy if this unit is to be able to do anything like the job expected of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not just an off-the-cuff statement. During the estimates committee hearings last year Senator Parer, when questioned about WEMU, indicated that he had no knowledge of its existence. Unfortunately, he is not here to talk about that at the moment, but I hope he does come into the chamber. When we spoke to the departments involved it seemed that they had very little knowledge. It was not until the second day of the committee hearings that we could get somebody from this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> export monitoring unit to come before the Senate estimates committee to explain what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we did find out that when it came to Tasmania at least that the woodchip export monitoring unit was failing to do its job. It failed on a number of bases. First of all, its existence was not known to key departments within the Commonwealth. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had failed to pass on to it information about breaches of woodchip conditions in Tasmania. Likewise, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories had failed to pass on to the woodchip export monitoring unit critical information about breaches of regulations in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Citizens who are concerned about the impact of export woodchipping on our high conservation value native forests do not know that WEMU exists. They do not know that there is a place within the Commonwealth orb to which they can address their complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we asked WEMU what it had done to let people know that it is the place to which complaints should go, we found that it had done no advertising whatever. There had been a press release, which, so far as I know, got no coverage. In fact, WEMU has failed to become recognised as the place to which complaints about breaches of woodchip regulations and woodchip proper practice, if there is such a thing, can be sent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give some instances. A very comprehensive document listing series of breaches of forestry practice was sent to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet by Mr Andrew Ricketts from Reedy Marsh near Deloraine in Tasmania. These included breaches of stream side reserves, logging in places where it should not have been allowed and so on. In fact, in Tasmania, the Forest Practices Board, the state instrumentality, had confirmed these breaches, yet its counterpart in the federal arena, the Woodchip Export Monitoring Unit, knew nothing about these breaches. They told me at the committee that if a breach had occurred, they would know about it. But when asked about this extensive range of breaches confirmed by the authorities at state level in Tasmania, they had no knowledge of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="236"> it at all. There was a complete breakdown and failure because they are unfunded and effectively hamstrung by the pittance which the Commonwealth allocates to them to do an enormously important and key job in trying to settle the contention about export woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it came to a breach of the law and the illegal logging of national estate forests on the east coast of Tasmania by the nation's biggest woodchipper, North, WEMU again seemed to have no knowledge and certainly no ability to act. The total outcome from this breaking of the law, whereby North went in and logged national estate forests on the east coast, was a smack on the hand through a letter from the minister. In other words, it was nothing much at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Nimmitabel in New South Wales in 1994, on the property of Mr Chris Graham and family, Harris&hyphen;Daishowa moved in without the owner's permission&mdash;this block was bought specifically to protect 60 to 70 hectares of old&hyphen;growth forest&mdash;and illegally logged this private land for woodchipping. The company has since accepted liability without prejudice and offered to pay the equivalent royalty of $15,000 for this unique and irreplaceable forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot tell the Senate the anguish of the Graham family, who put aside what was for them a big amount of money to protect what was for them a wonderful, magnificent piece of forest. They went down there one day and found that Harris&hyphen;Diashowa had gone in on their land illegally and logged it. They wrote to the national minister for forests, Mr Beddall, but got no reply. In 1995, they wrote again to his department, providing maps and full details. This was after WEMU, the Woodchip Export Monitoring Unit, was established by him. After persistence, they were told that the department had lost the file. Certainly there has been no action from WEMU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened there is a total travesty of those people's rights and the conservation values of those forests. It was a complete failure of the expectation that WEMU would be able to do its job of monitoring the environmental impact of the voracious export woodchip industry in Australia's high conser 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vation native forests. I might add that it is an impact beyond just the word `forests'. It is an impact that, as we have seen with the East Gippsland forest agreement in the last few days, is going to continue to erode vital areas of habitat for rare and endangered species of flora and fauna. It will continue to erode forests of inestimable value. We will continue to see a massive confrontation between the conservation movement and the export woodchippers who have been licensed to cut down Australia's native forests at the greatest rate in history at a time when we have less left than ever before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A specific federal body has been set up to be the interface for the concerns of millions of Australians who do not want export woodchipping. According to repeated opinion polls, 80 per cent of Australians do not want export woodchipping of our wild native forests. This industry is making extraordinary profits out of these publicly owned forests. Surely that federal body ought to be adequately financed from the sale of those forests. Surely it should be visible to the public. It is neither of those things. Here we have the government wanting to cut the measly amount of money that goes to funding this critical unit by $80,000 plus in the coming year. It is something that the Senate should not allow. We are not in a position to increase this levy, but if we were, that is what we should be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reiterate that there will be record levels of export woodchips taken out of this country in the coming years. The industry is going to make a killing, with billion dollar profits. It is surely not going to do any harm to increase what is at the moment, if you look at freight on board sales of woodchips, a one 1,000th levy on the money the woodchip companies get from the sale of these public forests so that there can be some adequate monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the government is going to argue that it is cutting the fee because there is a component of self&hyphen;regulation involved here&mdash;the companies are going to do an audited report each year themselves. That is not going to satisfy me, I do not think it will satisfy some of the honourable senators sitting very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="237"> close to me and it is certainly not going to satisfy the public. They are not gullible enough to believe that this industry, with its record of breaches of forest codes, unlawful illegal logging, destruction of private citizens' forests, and destruction of habitat of rare and endangered species, is going to be self&hyphen;regulatory. The public is not going to believe that this industry will in any way be self&hyphen;regulatory if that is going to get in the way of it making money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time we took a stand, at least on this neutral ground of having an umpire which has got the strength to do the job it was purported to be able to do. It was a good thing that it was set up&mdash;I congratulate the previous government for that&mdash;but we have found that, in its two years of operation, it simply is not well enough funded. The government, with that two years of experience tucked under its belt, should be giving this critical watchdog unit the profile it requires and the ability, not only to take in information that is handed to it willy&hyphen;nilly, but the ability to go out in the field and investigate complaints independently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideally, this should properly be an independent statutory authority so that it is able to independently act to make sure that in the coming years proper process is not infringed, as it is being repeatedly infringed in the logging of forests for woodchips by the eight woodchip companies which are licensed in this country. Properly also, there ought to be some division between its function as watchdog and police of what is going on in the forests and the judgment at the end of the day as to what it can do. These functions are all wrapped up in one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that we now know that WEMU is failing because it does not have the capacity to do a job that is much bigger than the one it is able to do on this shoestring budget. Two people, unknown even to other departments within the Commonwealth, completely unknown to the wider public, are expected to do the critical job of ensuring that these huge woodchip companies which are working in huge areas of forests are monitored. I think I saw the figure the other day: eleven football fields of forests in East Gippsland alone are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being cut each working day, and East Gippsland is only part of the suite of forests around the country being logged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is not going to go away. The contention will get worse as more and more forests are cut into. I would think for its own defence, for its own public kudos, the government would want to strengthen and improve the capability of this referee&mdash;this umpire, if you like&mdash;in the form of the Woodchip Export Monitoring Unit. So it is a little bit rich for the government to put before this chamber changed regulations which will actually decrease the amount of money going to this underfunded, understaffed and incapable unit within the federal bureaucracy. If the government does not want the unit to function adequately, then it should abolish it and put the money to some other use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit that there is no place, given the increased export woodchipping of the coming years and the increased contention there will be about the destruction of forests and contentious wildlife habitats, for a scale&hyphen;down of the puny watchdog function that the Commonwealth has put in place. It needs to be reviewed, greatly expanded and much better funded out of the enormous profits that these woodchip companies are making at the expense of the public interest and this nation's great forest environment heritage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I start by saying that the government does not accept the motion before the Senate today&mdash;notice of which was given by Senator Brown&mdash;and, moreover, that the government does not accept many of the assertions that Senator Brown has made today. But that is nothing extraordinary, in that we do not accept many of Senator Brown's assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just outline for the Senate briefly what this debate is about. It is about a regulation setting a level of charge&mdash;it is not a tax, it is a charge&mdash;which is required to be paid by woodchip exporters to meet the cost of a monitoring operation. I am very glad to have in the chamber two distinguished former chairmen of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. They would understand the point I am making that, where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="238"> a charge is made, a charge cannot be collected in excess of the cost which is sought to be defrayed by the charge. So, for example, if the cost of operating something were, say, $5 million a year, the Commonwealth is not able by regulation to charge $10 million a year and pocket the difference. In fact, there is a legal obligation upon the Commonwealth&mdash;as both Senator Colston and Senator Bob Collins would be aware&mdash;to refund amounts of charges which are received in excess of the cost which they exist to defray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston, in his period of time as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances dealt with a number of issues&mdash;incidentally, when Senator Bob Collins was the minister&mdash;where charges had to be refunded by the Commonwealth and arrangements had to be made to ensure that refund occurred. As Senator Colston will be aware, and Senator Bob Collins will also be aware, in relation to excess charges collected for meat inspection, amongst other things, it was quite a complex process of refunding the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what Senator Brown seeks to do is to say that he wants to force the Commonwealth to collect more money than it is legally entitled to collect and then force the Commonwealth to refund that money through a very complex procedure. That is really what this is all about. Senator Brown, in gilding the lily today, of course, has raised all sorts of concerns that he has about forests. I will take Senator Brown's concerns at face value, but as Senator Bob Collins would be aware, the management of forests is a state responsibility. The Commonwealth has imposed obligations to report&mdash;and I commend Senator Collins because I understand the unit in question was set up when he was the minister. The Commonwealth has placed on top of that a second layer of control, and that relates to the requirement to report to this unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not the principal control. The principal responsibility, constitutionally, remains with the states. So, if Senator Brown has concerns about what may have happened during the life of the previous government in New South Wales, it is not even a concern which should be levied against Senator Bob 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Collins; it is a concern which he should raise with the New South Wales government. Any matter to do with the management of forests is a responsibility of the relevant state government.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BROWN" NAMEID="QD4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown interjects that he believes that I have no idea. Senator Brown, we have seen your grasp of legal issues to do with regulations before and some of the extraordinary claims you made about the views of the regulations and ordinances committee, so I really would suggest that you cease to interject on this matter because, unfortunately, your track record on accuracy has not been too good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that there are number of things that Senator Brown has said today that are grossly inaccurate. One of those was that the new monitoring arrangements were self&hyphen;regulation and that these companies were going to audit themselves. Of course, Senator Brown is either so ignorant that he did not read the statement issued by Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, and the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, or, having read it, he decided not to bother accurately stating what is in the statement. The announcement, which was made on 31 October, requires that the auditing should be done by an independent person who is a registered company auditor, preferably with expertise in `forest/environmental management auditing', to verify the processes that the exporters have in place and the data on compliance that they provide to the woodchip export monitoring unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So rather than the companies auditing themselves&mdash;or, rather, our taking the information on trust, which has been the situation hitherto&mdash;we are further requiring that there be independent monitoring of the information which is supplied to the unit. Now Senator Brown knew that, or should have known that, because that was in the statement. However, Senator Brown chose to give a completely different story to the Senate. That is a matter for Senator Brown to wrestle with, but I am very disappointed that such a grossly inaccurate picture was presented to the Senate today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="239">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best thing that we can do is to work with the states to implement regional forest agreements which are based on ecologically sustainable forest management. It is not going to achieve anything to require the Commonwealth to collect a charge in excess of what it is legally required to do. We now have before us the absurdity&mdash;the absolute absurdity&mdash;of Senator Brown requiring the Commonwealth to collect money which it will have to repay, because that is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Brown really thinks that the best thing that the Commonwealth Public Service can do, and the best thing the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department can do, is collect money in excess of what they are entitled to collect, and then spend another six months wrestling with how they are going to refund it, and on what basis it is going to be refunded, and then draw up another set of regulations&mdash;and no doubt he will come in here and try and disallow those, frothing at the mouth&mdash;I am afraid that I disagree with him, because quite frankly it would be a total nonsense to require the Commonwealth to collect money in excess of what it needs and in excess of what it requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a debate about appropriations or about the appropriate level of funding&mdash;and I think Senator Collins, on the other side, having set up this unit, would recognise that. This is simply a technical debate about whether we are going to require the Commonwealth to collect money in excess of what it is legally entitled to. Senator Collins, when he was minister for primary industries, knew all the complexities of trying to refund money to people who have had money collected in excess of what the Commonwealth was entitled to. Senator Collins would be aware of all the difficulties we had in respect of meat export inspection charges which were in excess of what was necessary&mdash;all the difficulty we had in refunding those charges. I would be surprised if Senator Collins now wanted to go through the same exercise when we knew that the level of charge would be in excess of the requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even those who would say that the Commonwealth should spend more money on this unit would have to accept the fact that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this debate cannot change the level of Commonwealth expenditure on the matter. The level of Commonwealth expenditure on the matter has been set in the budget and, therefore, this debate is purely on the technicalities of whether we want to go down this circuitous path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole arrangement was put in place at the recommendation of the woodchip export advisory board, which contains, for Senator Brown's information, officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, amongst others. It was decided that we were going to ensure better accountability&mdash;that is no reflection on the previous arrangement, Senator Collins&mdash;and better transparency by ensuring that the unit reported directly to the minister rather than to the first assistant secretary of the land resources division of the department. Given that the division administers woodchip exports, to ensure that there was better monitoring and transparency of the monitoring, we thought it appropriate that this unit report directly to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have implemented the advice of the advisory board, which includes representatives from the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, representatives of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and is chaired by the executive director of the DPIE's agriculture and forest group. So we have done a lot to improve the accountability and the transparency. I say that as no slight on what the previous government did, because I commend Senator Collins on what he has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are requiring the audit to be independent. The auditor can be chosen by the exporter and must be paid for by the exporter, but obviously it has to be notified to the woodchip exports monitoring unit prior to commencing the audit. If there is any problem there, that will be picked up. For those on the other side of the chamber who roll their eyes at the suggestion that the company pay for the auditor, this is the arrangement with all audits in this country which are required by statute. Any audit that is performed is performed by an independent person at the expense of the person or company which is being audited. But it does not mean, of course, that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="240"> auditor is in the employ of the company being audited, merely that that is an expense that the company is required by law to meet. That is what is the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in conclusion, I think it would be extraordinary if the Senate were to require that the Commonwealth collect a charge of 12.6c a tonne when the amount to which the Commonwealth is entitled is only 11.2c a tonne, and then go through the process of refunding 1.4c a tonne on all woodchips collected. If we have to find a mechanism to do that, as Senator Bob Collins and Senator Mal Colston would be aware, that would be an extremely vexing task and another unnecessary burden on the officials of the department who, according to Senator Brown as evidenced before the chamber today, have much better things to do with their time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It grieves me deeply, I must say, not to be able to meet the expectations of Senator O'Chee on this occasion. The opposition will be supporting this motion. Senator O'Chee is absolutely correct in the concern that he has raised in respect of the requirement on the government not to levy a dollar more for a particular purpose than is required for that purpose. Might I say for the benefit of Senator O'Chee that it is that important issue which certainly preoccupied my consideration on this matter. But after consultation with my colleagues, the shadow minister for resources and the shadow minister for the environment, our position is that we will&mdash;acknowledging the reality of that problem&mdash;be supporting this motion. The reason for that is quite simple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hesitate to speak on behalf of Senator Brown, but I am sure he would concur with what I say&mdash;I listened carefully to what he said&mdash;in that I do not think that he is suggesting that it is a bad principle that the Commonwealth should not levy beyond the need for the purpose for which the levy is enacted. Senator Brown's argument, in so far as I heard it, is that, from his perspective, that levy is insufficient to meet the needs of the Commonwealth's responsibility in this area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long history attached to this. Senator O'Chee alluded to it, and some of us 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are very familiar with it. The situation, however, is not quite as simple as Senator O'Chee painted it, saying that forests are managed by state governments and therefore there is no role for the Commonwealth in ensuring that those forests are properly managed in respect of woodchipping. There is one major hole in that argument. I wish it was not there, but it is there. That is that the Commonwealth retains export control powers over woodchips and therefore it is in a position, with a very blunt instrument indeed, to affect forest management practices in so far as they relate to woodchips. It is the Commonwealth, not the states, that issues the licences for that particular forest operation to go on. Therefore, there is in fact a heavy responsibility on the Commonwealth to ensure that the conditions of the licences that it issues as a government are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forest management is the responsibility of the states. One of the great difficulties, which all of us here are aware of, that the former government had in attempting&mdash;let me assure you it put a lot of effort into it&mdash;to get a rational national forest policy for Australia, which was required, was that the Commonwealth did not have any constitutional responsibility for forest management. I might add&mdash;I think this would be an accurate statement&mdash;that the former government had no particular desire to be the day-to-day manager of Australian forests. But because of those export controls over this particularly controversial commodity, it had an absolute obligation to ensure that monitoring was carried out correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of that history of state forest management, in the past there was a process whereby a very small and hardworking number of Commonwealth officers, I might say in passing, were involved in what almost at times seemed seamless meetings that often went literally around the clock and into the next day, and then into the day after that. I have nothing but the highest regard for the dedication and professionalism of the officers I dealt with in the department. A very high standard of public service was indeed demonstrated by those officers. They were obliged to fundamentally accept the assurances of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="241"> actual forest managers&mdash;that is, the state government agencies&mdash;and their role in real terms because they were not resourced to do anything else. They could not go beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found that to be an unsatisfactory situation when I discovered it, as did the former minister for resources. The former government deliberately imposed this levy in order to fund much better resourced direct surveillance because, unfortunately, there are a number of examples&mdash;and some of them, I regret to say, are bad ones&mdash;where the assurances that were provided by state governments on this matter were not met. Senator Brown has alluded to one of the more dramatic, and I have to say regrettable, occurrences that in fact occurred. So it was necessary for the Commonwealth to have a much better resourced and direct role in monitoring compliance with the conditions that were set on its own licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really the point here. It is not simply, as Senator O'Chee put, a question of, `Well, state governments do this; we are basically a postbox.' They are our licences and we have to ensure the conditions are met. There was ample evidence, certainly enough to satisfy me in the past, that those conditions were not met. On too many occasions we were not able to adequately check on that independently of the assurances we were given by state forest agencies that everything was okay because we simply were not resourced to do so. That is why this levy was imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The levy is being reduced because of an arrangement that the government entered into with the forest companies that they would do their own independent audits, thereby reducing the workload for the Commonwealth and imposing an extra layer of responsibility, as the government sees it, on the companies. The problem as I see it, without having the opportunity to have that tested, is that I saw enough evidence&mdash;and I am not suggesting the majority of these operations are not properly managed, because they are&mdash;to indicate that the exceptions were too often and too dramatic. In the past particular companies, as well as state governments, have not done the right thing either. So I think there is a legitimate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> degree of scepticism here in the Commonwealth parliament about whether these independent audits of the companies are the way to go and whether they will lead to a lesser task for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to the Senate that I have carefully considered this issue. In the last 24 hours I have spent a fair bit of time on it. The actual level of reduction in the levy is small; I think it is less than a cent. In percentage terms it is quite a small reduction, but it is in fact a reduction. It is a change in the levy which in our view is in the wrong way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most valid point the government can make in opposing this disallowance motion&mdash;and Senator O'Chee made it&mdash;is that there is an obligation on the Commonwealth not to in fact levy a greater sum of money than is required for the purpose for which that levy is imposed. It is indeed, and I can attest to this personally, a very messy business being required&mdash;as I was when minister on a number of occasions&mdash;to repay that levy, simply, apart from anything else, from the point of view of trying to work out an equitable way of repaying it when you have a legal requirement to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the solution for the government, one that we would like to see imposed, is quite simple. It is this: the budget settings of this government are not the Ten Commandments; they were not brought down from Mount Sinai carved in stone. In fact, they can be changed by the government without even coming anywhere near this parliament. I differ with Senator Brown when I say that the current levy is probably sufficient, without going into it in any detail. Perhaps Senate estimates may reveal a different story; in fact, I am sure this matter will be canvassed at Senate estimates. But I suggest to the government, with the greatest respect, that the easiest solution would be simply to vary the budget of the surveillance authority and put what some people would think of as modest resources into surveillance and ensure that the surveillance task that the Commonwealth exercised in fact used the levy that was required. Some people would think that would be an absolute minimum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="242">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, can I say that I have no difficulty in concurring with that view. I think it is a regrettable move to make, I might add, in political terms. To be frank&mdash;not that I want to offer gratuitous advice to the government, particularly when it is a small amount of money involved&mdash;the easiest way the government could remedy this would be by simply agreeing to use the resources raised to improve the degree of surveillance the Commonwealth is offering. Frankly, I do not think the politics of this are good for the government. On those grounds, the opposition will be supporting the disallowance motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am certainly not happy with the idea that this licence fee is too much; that we should be reducing it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After listening to Senator O'Chee, I suggest that he has obviously never spent time in the forests of East Gippsland, particularly, or in other forests, such as the Wombat forest and the forests of Western Australia. If he had, he would see how, unfortunately, we simply cannot trust these companies. For the government to come in here and even suggest that we should leave more of the monitoring up to these companies is an absolute mockery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have walked through the Wombat forest, where I acknowledge that woodchipping at the moment has ceased&mdash;I do not expect it will always remain that way unfortunately. I saw that they broke almost every rule they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could possibly find, from failing to keep adequate stands of timber beside water catchment areas and along the creeks to failing to maintain roads; failing to actually clear up to the point where they were taking only the best sections of the logs; taking them so far above the ground that they actually reduced what they were paying for them; and leaving so much of the crowns and the thinnings on the ground that the local community could no longer have trail rides through the area because horses were stumbling, in one case actually breaking legs on the rubbish that was left on the forest floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that finally the previous government stopped chipping in that area. But I have no faith that if we further downgrade the surveillance process and surveillance system, areas such as the Wombat forest will not be logged again, or that the Wombat forest itself will not be opened up again to woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The companies that are mining our native forests, that are devastating the habitats of threatened and endangered species and, in particular&mdash;I stress that this is happening yet again in East Gippsland&mdash;that are ruining our water catchment areas, surely are not the people to be left to look after what they are doing and to see whether they are doing it properly. Indeed, if $88,000 is such a concern, if these companies are running on such a marginal budget, then surely they should just give up woodchipping and get out of it if they are worried about being charged that extra $88,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process we are discussing today is far from adequate, as has already been explained. Surely we should at least have somebody on the ground in each state to randomly check the coupes that are being cut, the way in which they are being cut and whether some of the minimum requirements are being met. I notice on the map that has just been published in East Gippsland the significant areas that have been temporarily put aside along creeks and rivers. But having looked in East Gippsland at what has already been done, I have no faith whatsoever that these 20-metre and 40-metre buffer zones will be met. Here we see that there is not even someone, an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="243"> independent person, on the ground in East Gippsland on a regular basis&mdash;indeed, I understand, on any basis whatsoever&mdash;to go out and to look at what is happening.</PARA>

Unfortunately, actually getting maps from people to look at which coupes were supposed to be cut&mdash;which was extremely difficult&mdash;we found that those maps did not line up with what actually had been done and the areas they had got in and cut. It is suggested that some of the trees left are habitat trees. I do not know what they are expecting to actually climb up those trees as a good wind will blow them down, and a possum would be pushing it to get more than a couple of metres off the ground. To suggest that these trees are going to be habitat for a variety of creatures, particularly those that were set aside for the powerful owl not far from the Croajingalong border, is an absolute joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we have a better monitoring process, I think the community response to this government's decision will get stronger and stronger. After listening to the rhetoric that has been put out by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and listening to the community concerns voiced to our office in faxes and phone calls, the minister is not fooling anyone. We are clearing, I would estimate, in East Gippsland something like 19 football fields of forest a day. In 20 years, on the government's own admission, we will have basically clear&hyphen;felled half the remaining forests in East Gippsland. What we are doing is pushing towards the probable extinction in that area of the tiger quoll, the spotted tiger quoll, the sooty owl, the masked owl and the powerful owl.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, and particularly Senator O'Chee, can come in here and say, `We can push the ball back to the state governments. They will look after it.' Unfortunately, the records of the Victorian and Tasmanian governments are absolutely appalling, as is that of the Western Australian government. We cannot leave them to do it. The Commonwealth has not just the export controls on woodchip licences; surely it has to recognise, Senator O'Chee, that it has some responsibility for World Heritage. To suggest that we can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply put our hands up here in this place and say, `Look, sorry, we can pass that all back to the state governments' is an old and tried method that simply no-one will be fooled by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the additional money collected can be spent in a range of ways and, indeed, urgently needs to be spent. The amount of money should be increased threefold, not decreased in any way whatsoever. The process of monitoring needs to be opened up to public consultation so that those groups and organisations which really do have some accurate information, which have put together maps of what is happening and which have the photos to show the damage that is occurring can be involved in the monitoring process. To suggest that, with the increase in the rate of cutting and the increase in the areas which can be cut in East Gippsland, we need to decrease the pittance these companies are paying is an absolute disgrace. I support Senator Brown's motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Brown's motion, not necessarily  for the same purpose that Senator Brown has moved it but I certainly agree with the importance that he has placed upon a regulation which provides funding for a monitoring service. My personal view, quite frankly, is that the monitoring unit never worked, because it never had sufficient funding to start with. Of course we, when in government, put it in place. But that is my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think my view has been supported by the failure to actually carry out prosecutions of severe breaches that have occurred in forest activities since the introduction of the woodchip export monitoring unit. As Senator Bob Collins said, the Commonwealth does have a responsibility because the Commonwealth does issue the licences. It has a responsibility to ensure that the product exported under those licences is legitimate for all intents and purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee said states have responsibility for the management of the state forests. True, they do. But, unfortunately for many states, particularly Tasmania, Victoria, maybe New South Wales and, probably to a lesser 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="244"> extent, Western Australia&mdash;and I will focus on my own state&mdash;the state forest agency has got itself into a predicament with regard to its own funding. It has to rely very heavily on the volume turnover of wood to actually meet the state government's requirements of a return from the operation it runs. Therefore, woodchip exports are very important in terms of providing revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, they have got themselves caught in a trap. They cannot monitor, do not monitor and for many years have not been able to monitor. Indeed, some legislation at a state level actually precludes them from monitoring. I will just quickly refer to one concessional arrangement in Tasmania that existed, the ANM concession. Even though it was a public forest, a crown forest, forestry was not even allowed into that concession without the permission of the company that had been granted it under state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My purpose for supporting this motion is that I believe we should have a total focus on utilisation and downstream processing in this country. That is something the government has said. Indeed the government has accused us of being the woodchip export champions of the world. I can remember the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) making many statements about how they would change things, about how they were jobs driven, about how they would put in place regulations that were more equitable but would lead to greater downstream processing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we debated the other regulations, including this one, when the regulations were changed, they were disallowed in the House of Representatives. The old regulations that operated under our government were changed and the new ones were brought in. All of those regulations, bar maybe one or two, actually weakened the provision for sourcing for woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a big country and there are many forests to get around. In most cases, the first point a woodchip export monitoring unit will go to for information about where forest activities are occurring is the state forest agency. The state forest agency, in general, has an agreement with most companies that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it will advise them of any inspections to be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some safety requirements that they will use as an excuse, so the woodchip export monitoring unit never got on the front foot. It was always on the back foot. It never really conducted any random inspections where it could actually prove or see first hand exactly what was going on. Rather, it always got a manicured approach when it went out to visit any specific coupes, if it ever did. It always got the manicured tour. Therefore, it failed, and it will continue to fail regardless of what funding it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we have to drive industry development in this country in what is one of the most important resource based industries that we have because we have an increasing trade deficit with regard to wood product. We all know that, so we all ought to be trying to do something about turning that around. The forest industry is going to exist. As I said, it is a most important industry in this country, but we have to drive the engine for change to utilise more of the wood that we take from our forests in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tim Fischer put out his trade statement, as I said, focused on jobs. According to what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says today, in terms of a global sense our trade as a share of the global trade is actually declining. When you look at the converse of that, in terms of wood products we have an increasing import problem. We ought to be trying to do something about that. I would urge the government to take on board what Senator Bob Collins said with regard to the utilisation of the funds. In fact, I would like to see the funds increased threefold because right now there are real problems with regard to adherence to the requirements for the sourcing of wood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that with many of these issues it is difficult to be across them all. There is the independent audit, or the self&hyphen;audit, by companies. It is really a self&hyphen;audit because, essentially, under the regulations they are required to provide information about where they sourced certain wood from and what volumes they sourced. Once it is turned into woodchips, it is very difficult for the Inspector Clouseaus of the woodchip export monitoring 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="245"> unit to go down and determine which chip came from where and from what log because a chip is a chip and it is on the pile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in essence, whoever does the audit of the company's information provider has to accept at face value that it is reasonably accurate. Moreover, they do not have much choice because they cannot really prove to the contrary. The only way they can do that is to get out in the field and see whether or not there are breaches. All the woodchip export monitoring unit can do is see whether or not there are actual breaches in harvesting activities. It cannot do anything other than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to refer to how bad it really is in Tasmania's case so far as the state agency is concerned, the manager of the public forests in Tasmania and, indeed, in any other state. We know that sawlogs in Tasmania are being woodchipped in huge volumes. It is acknowledged&mdash;indeed it was acknowledged in a court proceeding most recently by the state agency in Tasmania. I have a view that, if the government and we are all committed to more jobs in this country, we ought to be trying to do something about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many ways in which the government can spend money to actually get a focus for this industry that will make it export orientated. No sawmilling operation in Tasmania has a real export focus. There was a case recently where a developer proposed to the state a development which would have been totally export oriented and which related to sawmilled, processed, hard solid timber. Yet it could not get off the ground because in Tasmania a cartel exists of the major woodchipping companies and one or two major sawmillers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to change that. If governments have a responsibility, they have a responsibility to ensure that public resources like forests are maximised in the interests of the public. We must take whatever steps we can to ensure that. Where it can be clearly indicated that we can do better, then government&mdash;and the Commonwealth in this case in dealing with export woodchipping licences&mdash;has a responsibility to take whatever steps it can and which are necessary to put in place mechanisms that will ensure that you maxi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mise the benefit. Otherwise, all of the rhetoric about jobs and improved export driven markets or export operations with regards to resource based industries is just rubbish; it is just rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Australian public do have a concern about our forest industries. Our paper industry, for instance, is in decline. I just cannot see how it can continue to survive unless we have major pulp mill developments in this country. Therefore, we ought to be very clearly looking at it and taking the approach that we need to drive something to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not happen from our major exporters of woodchips. North and Boral have a view, which is fine for them from a company point of view, that they want to make as much money as they can from woodchips. There is a lot of money to be made from woodchips. There is no doubt about that. But we will not get the sort of downstream processing development that we need if we do not take steps to put in place regulations and requirements that will lead us to greater development and downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really appeal to Senators Harradine and Colston. Even though this is really an itsy&hyphen;bitsy issue in so far as it is one regulation relating to the export of woodchips, it is a very tiny step or a holding of the line in the right direction. What we need to consider longer term is to get more information&mdash;and it is available&mdash;before the parliament that will clearly identify that we are not doing enough, that we are not being successful enough in terms of downstream processing of a very important natural resource that could provide so much more economic benefit to this country and so many more jobs for people, particularly in regional Australia. We really need to take greater steps to achieve those sorts of objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, I think we must hold the line on the funding for the woodchip export monitoring unit. As useless as it might be, it is something we should maintain at least. We should try to get it greater independence so that it can function better because, as I said earlier, this is a big country. There are hundreds and hundreds of coupes, if not thou 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="246"> sands of coupes, being cut at any one time. It is an almost impossible task for any group. As Senator Bob Collins rightly pointed out earlier, officers are dedicated, but they are totally underresourced, totally underfunded and have a task that is almost impossible to do and can only be done in a piecemeal way. That being the case though, it should still be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked questions before on other regulations that relate to sourcing. I would suggest to the Greens and the Democrats, as I have done to Senator Colston and to my own colleagues, that at the end of the day the only real way you will fix this problem, if a government is not prepared to take the necessary steps, is to change the Export Control Act. That will relate to where wood is sourced for export woodchips. If you place a criterion in the act, then you do not have a problem. That ultimately may well be the step that will have to be taken to fix this problem and actually get a focus for downstream processing in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to strongly support the motion of Senator Brown and those who have spoken already. I just want to make one short remark and that is that I believe the government's argument for rejection of this motion is spurious in the extreme. It is spurious for one primary reason that was well spelt out by Senator Bob Collins. It is that this WEMU unit does not meet the needs for which it was established, does not do the job for which it was established, and it is up to the government to gather as much money as possible to make it an effective working unit. In those circumstances, it is impossible for any payer of those levies to demand of the government any refund whatsoever because they know that that unit needs far more funds than it is getting to do the job under the circumstances for which it was set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government not to be macho and bullyboyish in this instance but to recognise the validity of the argument, which was very carefully crafted and very well expressed, and accept it and do something about improving this situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If honourable senators looked back at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , they would find that, via Senate estimates questions largely and other questions on notice, many of the questions that originally resulted in the public conclusion that there was not anybody who actually monitored Commonwealth woodchip licence conditions were asked by my former colleague Senator Chamarette. I think it was the case that there even were some people within the Commonwealth who believed that someone was looking at export licence conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, funnily enough, when those questions were asked initially about who was monitoring export licence conditions, we were shunted off to the states by the Commonwealth saying, `They are the ones that look after forests.' When questions were asked to the state bodies through our state parliamentarians, we were once again shunted off. The states said, `We look after certain environmental criteria, but these are Commonwealth licences. It is not within our ambit to monitor Commonwealth licence conditions.' So they shunted us back to the Commonwealth. The questions went backwards and forwards until it was inevitable that somebody realised that nobody was monitoring Commonwealth licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no point in people crowing about how wonderful the conditions were on Commonwealth woodchip licences when there was nobody to monitor them. Hence, I guess it was inevitable that WEMU was set up. I will not say that was the only influence, because many community groups were saying similar things. But it helped that those questions and answers came through at the federal parliamentary level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the response from Senator O'Chee today certainly indicated the government's lack of understanding in terms of what people would think is a reasonable requirement for the Commonwealth to monitor its own licence conditions; that is, that an auditor approved or paid for by a company somehow or other would be an acceptable body to monitor Commonwealth licence conditions. WEMU has not been around all that long, and I wonder whether the Common 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="247"> wealth Auditor-General has even had the opportunity of doing an audit. That would be very interesting. When you look at the goals of a particular unit like WEMU, if the resources that have been allocated are insufficient or if they are not being used in a way that actually meets those goals, then it would be a very useful thing to have that particular body audited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government to take up that suggestion&mdash;or perhaps I can make the suggestion if they feel that auditing is going to be effective and efficient in this particular arena&mdash;for the Commonwealth Auditor-General to look at WEMU and see whether the pathetically small amount of resources are being used effectively to achieve the goals of monitoring Commonwealth export licence conditions. I would be fairly certain that it would hardly be seen to be effective to be underspending in such a small budget if the goals of that particular unit were to monitor federal licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we know this&mdash;I certainly know it in Western Australia&mdash;is that community groups have had firm evidence about breaches in licence conditions, but there was no acknowledged understanding of those breaches at the Commonwealth level. There seemed to be a real slip between cup and mouth and there seemed to be the necessity to believe, even at that stage, what the companies were saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the first reports came out, there seemed to be an absolute requirement for the very poorly resourced unit to believe what the company said. If you ask a company, `Have you breached your licence conditions?' then what do you expect them to say? What do you expect a company appointed and paid auditor to say about a company's licence conditions? How much information will they receive? They will receive the written information that is given to them by the company. Is the company going to provide to the auditor information about breaches in their own licence conditions? I hardly think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we have to start thinking about matching the rhetoric with reality; that is, if people are concerned that the community do not have a good idea about how wonderful 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the industry is in maintaining their high standards of environmental excellence and in maintaining their licence conditions, then that needs to be proved. I have heard Senator Newman say on numerous occasions that the only way in which people can have confidence in our social security system is if we get the cheats and, in those instances, I see everybody on that side saying yes, even if they are technical breaches. Does she come down heavily on those people? Yes, she does, even if it means them starving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happens with corporate cheats? The answer is nothing. When was the last prosecution for a breach? When was the last large corporation required to lose its licence? When was the last action that took place due to these corporate breaches which are probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars overall? What happens to these people; what is the real impact on the ecosystem; and what is the real impact on the community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kind of impact it would have on the community was shown in the example that Senator Brown gave of the people who put their life savings into a piece of land to preserve it for the future because they believed in that but who found that the company not only logged their property but also offered them royalties&mdash;royalties which most of us in the conservation movement think are totally inadequate&mdash;for the loss of that irreplaceable resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the strongest possible words I would support this motion. It is petty minded, in my belief, to act in this way: to suggest that it is an over&hyphen;collection, when in fact it is an underspending, is an indictment of the government. I think there is time now for them to reassess the situation and to start doing the heavy work that is required to rebuild any semblance of public confidence in this process.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes various amendments to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act, together with consequential amendments to the Air Force Act and other Commonwealth legislation. All the amendments are associated with ongoing improvements to command and administration arrangements for the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition came to government with a commitment to improving the management of Australia's defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to achieving this commitment is ensuring that the command structure of the Defence Force is appropriate for Australia's present and future national security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New arrangements for the command of the Defence Force are being introduced in stages. It is an objective of this process to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of the various levels of command, and to ensure in particular that responsibility for operations is vested in the new Headquarters Australian Theatre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In association with the organisational changes, it is necessary to change the designations and titles of various components of the organisation. This bill introduces new titles for the heads of the three Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the titles, from chiefs of staff to Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force, recognise the continuing role of the service chiefs as commanders of the Navy, Army and Air Force, with that role set in the framework of the new command structure. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="249">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, announced the planned changes to the command arrangements in January 1996. These changes, to be introduced between now and the year 2000, will further refine the Defence Force's command capability at the strategic and operational levels. When complete, the revised arrangements will allow flexibility when planning for, and committing, the Defence Force to operations. They will also introduce a structure that is identical in times of peace and war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key element of the changes is the incorporation of the Navy, Army and Air Force Offices in Canberra, into the Headquarters Australian Defence Force as component headquarters. This happened on 1 July 1996 when the Navy, Army and Air Force Offices were retitled Navy, Army and Air Force Headquarters respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The title changes for the service chiefs naturally flow from their modernised command role in this new structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second set of amendments deals with the transfer of personnel between the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no legislative provision for the direct transfer of personnel from one Service to another. Such a transfer requires formal separation from one Service then appointment to, or enlistment in, the other Service. This is a cumbersome procedure, and administratively costly. These amendments are designed to streamline the administration of transfers by enabling the direct transfer of personnel between the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new transfer power is vested with the chief of the Service that is losing the member. The consent of a transferred member is required, and the chief of the Service that is to gain the member must also agree. An instrument of transfer would specify the rank, seniority and period of appointment or enlistment that are to apply on transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is provision to ensure that any return of service obligation applying to a transferred member will continue to apply after the transfer. A further provision ensures that service in the losing Service is counted as service in the gaining Service for purposes such as the calculation of leave entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A service chief can delegate a power to authorise or approve a transfer under these provisions but not to an officer holding a rank below that of Brigadier (or equivalent).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third set of amendments is to provisions which require twelve months service by certain officers after they are promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing provisions, the service chiefs may reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of colonel (or equivalent) or higher, where the officer has not completed a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period of twelve months service since being promoted to that rank. These provisions are designed to increase efficiency by reducing the posting turbulence caused by officers who accept promotion then resign shortly afterwards. Curbing this practice facilitates smoother personnel management, with less disruption to family life, and allows substantial savings in removal and associated costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same considerations apply to officers who accept promotion to the substantive ranks of major (or equivalent) or lieutenant colonel (or equivalent). The provisions are accordingly widened to enable the relevant service chief to reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of Major (or equivalent) and above, where the officer has not completed a period of 12 months service in the rank since being promoted to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final set of amendments enables the delegation of the power of the Governor&hyphen;General to make limited&hyphen;tenure promotions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, Defence legislation was amended to enable the Governor&hyphen;General to make promotions for fixed periods (limited&hyphen;tenure promotions). The effect of such a promotion is that an officer is retired on completion of the period, unless offered an extension or, alternatively, further service at the original rank level. These provisions are intended to allow for a limited number of promotions to Colonel (or equivalent) rank or above, where an individual has skills relevant to a particular appointment rather than skills that will enable continued employability at the higher rank level. Limited&hyphen;tenure promotions are for a set period, normally 3 years, and may be declined by the officers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor&hyphen;General has delegated his general powers to promote officers in the Defence Force but the current delegation provisions do not cover limited&hyphen;tenure promotions. The amendments accordingly enable the Governor&hyphen;General to delegate the power to make limited&hyphen;tenure promotions. The delegations may only be to the Chief of the Defence Force or to a service chief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated earlier, these rather disparate amendments are linked in that they are all part of the continuing effort to improve the management of the Defence Force. I am confident that the Senate will support the legislation as part of that effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I am never provocative. I am just stating the facts. I want to remind the Senate of the true role of the Labor Party in this appalling affair. In the late 1980s the Hindmarsh Island bridge was proposed by Binalong Pty Ltd, a company owned by Tom and Wendy Chapman. The South Australian government later assumed the responsibility to build the bridge, with Binalong to pay half the cost. In December 1993, some members of the Ngarrindjeri people, the applicant women, applied for a protection order under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 to prevent the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. In July 1994, Professor Cheryl Saunders provided a report to former Minister Tickner stating the Hindmarsh Island bridge area was a sacred site to the Ngarrindjeri people. Former minister Tickner granted a 25&hyphen;year protection order over the Hindmarsh Island bridge area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="251">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1995, the Federal Court quashed the protection order. It held that the minister had failed to follow the due process of the heritage protection act by not personally reading what is generally known as secret women's business. This decision was later affirmed by the full bench of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1995, a South Australian royal commission found that the secret women's business was a fabrication. This finding was supported by the view of some of the Ngarrindjeri women&mdash;the dissident women&mdash;who maintained that there was no secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island. A new application under the heritage protection act was made by the applicant Ngarrindjeri women. Justice Jane Mathews was appointed to prepare a report into this new application and in June last year Justice Mathews submitted her report. In September the High Court invalidated the appointment of Justice Mathews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, we have had four inquiries or royal commissions. We have seen over $4 million of public money poured into those inquiries. That money has been totally wasted&mdash;nothing has occurred as a result of that expenditure. That has been a direct result of the previous Labor government. They wasted that money. It is an example of the incompetence of those people and I am happy to demonstrate that to Senator Bob Collins now. It is a long and sorry tale and one that they should be deeply ashamed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to government the Hindmarsh Island mess was just one of many we inherited from Labor and it is one we have sought to clean up. You would think that the Labor Party would have some remorse to at least assist in the clean up. But, no, instead, they are in here obstructing us, opposing every effort to clean this expensive mess up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also said yesterday that they are a laughing stock in the public area because of their handling of this issue. You would think that they would have woken up to the fact that the Hindmarsh Island affair was a big nail in their political coffin at the last election. It is obvious that they have not learnt anything from that sorry saga. Now, after creating this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expensive mess, what is their response? It is to insist that we either accept an amendment that will almost certainly guarantee years of litigation, delay and public expenditure or leave things alone and let nature take its course. That will also guarantee more public expense, more delays and, in all probability, more litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hindmarsh Island Bridge is an albatross around Labor's neck and, in a political sense, the longer it hangs there&mdash;and by their behaviour today it is obvious that it will&mdash;it will be like a stinking carcass on them, and so be it. If that is what they want to wear, I am happy for them to wear it. If they insist on going down the track they are on, then let it be on their heads. Let the Australian public have no delusions about it. The Labor Party has already wasted $4 million of taxpayers' money on this issue and now wants to waste up to another million dollars. Let us not forget that of the four inquiries already held, three determined that the bridge should proceed and the one that found otherwise was overturned on appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us deal with the nonsense put forward by Labor both yesterday morning and in an ill&hyphen;informed and misdirected outburst by Senator Bolkus last night. Senator Bolkus rather foolishly assumed that the legal advice that I referred to was in relation to the nonsense he raised about the constitutional validity of this bill. He was wrong, and I pointed that out last night. The additional advice I sought was in relation to the opposition's amendment, which I note is worded differently than the proposed amendment raised by Labor in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to release that legal advice, Senator Bolkus, which made it perfectly clear that your amendments, as I said yesterday, will only invite further litigation, tying things up for goodness knows how long and costing taxpayers more money. I also note that yesterday Senator Collins and Senator Kernot became excited when I told the Senate that Father Frank Brennan&mdash;</PARA>

It is a frequent assertion of Senator Collins. I would suggest that Senator Collins did that to cover himself because he knows full well that the arguments he has been putting forward are spurious nonsense. As for the constitutional argument, it is just so much hot air. In fact, if you applied the very same argument to last year's ATSIC amendment bill, which removed the right to elect a chairman and instead allowed for appointment of a chairman, you would find that Labor voted against the very principle that they now espouse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those who know Frank Brennan personally will recognise this when they hear the full quote and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="254"> very important qualification that he put on this. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Bolkus for pointing this out. They will know the irony with which Frank Brennan often embellishes his comments. Let us hear the full quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh yes, particularly given the strength of the things the minister has said. But I think we are almost at the stage where anything done will be a sham, aren't we, including this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What Father Brennan was saying in terms of the full quote was, `Yes, there are ways of concluding this matter and complying with the Heritage Protection Act, and this is one that I am proposing. However, this legislation is a sham.' It is. The minister deliberately sought to quote the whole of that paragraph with the exception of those last three very important lines. It is a habit that he gets into very often. We have to pick him up on it very often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing needs to be said. In terms of the particularly offensive manner in which the minister has charged into this parliament this morning, we who were here yesterday have all noted during it the dramatic comparison between this and yesterday. The reason I make that point is that I want to say to the Senate something I said to a colleague after the debate yesterday and got agreement on. We have made a lot of excuses for this minister because he is a decent person. He is someone&mdash;I happily say it now&mdash;I personally like. We have made a lot of excuses. However, it is now close to 12 months on. The minister has been in this portfolio for a year. The cold, hard facts, as disagreeable as you might find them, are that in real terms this minister has as much a grasp of this portfolio now as he had on day one, and that is none at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the minister can demonstrate&mdash;he has done it again in here&mdash;is that he is capable of reading a script. He had a full phalanx of advisers in the advisers box in with him yesterday, but he was so unsure of his arguments. As Senator Bolkus said yesterday afternoon in here, he was so completely nonplussed when perfectly reasonable questions were asked. The minister said to Senator Bolkus and other senators in here that he had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to adjourn this bill for 24 hours to get legal advice about whether he could accept the amendment I moved here in the parliament yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron took significant exception to the suggestion made by Senator Bolkus that it was also deficient not to have sought advice from the heads of power on which this legislation relies. Senator Herron rejected that and said, `No. That is not correct. I am only asking to defer this bill for 24 hours to give consideration to whether this amendment can be accepted by the government.' I point out to the honourable minister that this amendment was moved in the House of Representatives on 5 November last year&mdash;three months ago&mdash;by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. Three months ago, the opposition put up in lights in the most obvious way we could that we would be moving this amendment in the Senate. If we moved it in the House of Representatives, of course we would move it here in similar terms. We have, despite the fact&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The arguments supporting it were canvassed at length. The minister talks about referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . It would not hurt him if he did occasionally. He has so few pieces of legislation to administer in this portfolio that it is just appalling that he cannot get across the few he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had three months notice, Minister, that this amendment would be moved. That was something I commented on when talking to my colleagues. Despite the fact that you had three months notice, you were totally unable to respond to this amendment and we had to have the debate deferred for 24 hours so you could check on this. You talk about checking the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of shams, Minister, I have a few questions to ask about the options that might be available to you. This is an obnoxious piece of legislation. Senator Harradine correctly referred yesterday to a short additional comment by Senator Cooney on why the Senate should not pass this bill. I agree with what Senator Harradine said about this dis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="255"> senting report. This is as succinct, as cogent and as well written a dissenting report as I have ever seen in a Senate committee report. I noted that at the time I read it and I mentioned that to Senator Cooney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an indication of why Senator Cooney had as distinguished a career at the Melbourne bar as he has had in the Senate. Because it is so short&mdash;and I agree with what Senator Harradine said&mdash;and in the face of Senator Herron's bluster and technical legal arguments, I will quote this report because there are some matters of real justice that require this bill not to be supported. Senator Cooney put it better than I have seen anybody put it so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Herron is going to be giving A&hyphen;G's advice about black letter law. I will have a fair bit more to say about that now. I actually wanted this matter to be wrapped up in 10 minutes, but because of the way you behaved this morning there are a number of things that you have said that now need to be responded to before this debate concludes&mdash;and they will be. I was hoping that it was going to be a short debate, but it is not going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is black letter law, Senator Herron. As I said yesterday&mdash;and I did not say this to cover me or anything else&mdash;I am not a lawyer, but I am very familiar with the law. Over the years there have been many cases where courts have properly construed black letter law to the great distress of the judges who were doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a very silly statement about these issues on radio earlier this year when talking about the Wik decision. He said, `Judges do not make laws; parliaments do.' What a piece of factual nonsense. Judges have been making laws for hundreds of years. Whilst I may on occasions&mdash;and this is open to me to do, as it is for every other citizen in society to do&mdash;disagree with the way in which judges have made law, I say without hesitation, `Thank God they do.' On many occasions, the community at large has been the beneficiary of the law making&mdash;particularly in the area of natural justice&mdash;that the judges have engaged in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree, Senator Harradine, that sometimes they have not. Sometimes I disagree with the law that judges make. What I was going to go on to say, Senator Harradine, is that there has been enormous development over the years in the area of natural justice. Most of it has been made by judges and not by parliaments. At the end of the day, judges like to bring down decisions that are just in real terms as well as comply with black letter law. I will quote what Senator Cooney had to say about this. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill should not be passed because the benefits to be gained by doing so are outweighed by the harm its enactment will cause. The government seeks to bring a matter to do with the Hindmarsh Bridge to an expeditious and inexpensive conclusion. To do so, it has introduced legislation which, if passed, is likely to prejudice the rule of law, may breach the Racial Discrimination Act, be reasonably seen by people, including many Aborigines, as in fact doing so, and gives one side to a dispute an advantage over the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues could and should be avoided by letting the law as it now is run its course. No legal or legal like proceedings to do with persons involved in the matter of the Hindmarsh Bridge are now extant. However, there have been proceedings undertaken with the understanding that the law relevant to them would not change before the issues involved in them had finally been resolved. That is not the case. There is still contention over the status of land which will be affected by the building of the Hindmarsh Bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past, government has legislated in a way which has affected legal proceedings then imminent or in fact taking place. This is an unhappy precedent. It should not be followed. The rule of law is an instrument essential to the doing of justice, to the vindication of rights and to the restraint of arbitrary power. To change a law because of the perceived need for expedition and money saving is to pursue an unhealthy course. To do so in a way that will give one group of people an advantage over another becomes a significant risk to the legal framework of our society. Different legal minds have come to contrary opinions as to whether the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill if passed would contravene the Racial Discrimination Act. Given that there is a solution to the Hindmarsh Bridge issue other than this legislation, and given that a range of reasonable and learned people hold a strong belief that it contravenes the Racial Discrimination Act, this bill should not be passed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advice received from the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department of 27 November was tabled at the Senate committee hearings. I remind Senator Collins of the recommendations of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The majority report was that they considered the bill as necessary to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facilitate the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and that action should be taken now to remove the impediment to its construction caused by the heritage protection act. So there is no doubt about the majority opinion. I will come to Senator Cooney's opinion. Like Senator Collins I have a great respect for Senator Cooney and I will answer that in a moment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring back to Senator Bolkus's statement, in the advice received from the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department of 27 November which was tabled at the Senate committee hearings he indicated that there was no basis, particularly constitutional, on which a court could invalidate the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill once it was passed. This bill has been through all the normal checks and balances, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Never at any stage did I say that it had not, and I am just reinforcing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not recall anyone, including Senator Bolkus, raising the question of the constitutional basis for the bill at the committee's hearings. He never did. Suddenly it was trotted out yesterday that there was some constitutional impediment. You had ample opportunity, Senator Bolkus, during the legal and constitutional committee's hearings, but you never brought that up at all. Not a whisper. Then you came in here yesterday as if it was some great revelation. As I said, it is hot air in a paper bag. It had no validity, and I was told that yesterday and I am reinforcing it now. It had no validity whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise, Mr Chairman. I want to point out that, if another reporter gets appointed, that comes out of ATSIC expenditure. That is what that suggestion does. ATSIC will have to find the money for a fifth inquiry. That will mean taking money that could have been spent on housing, education, health, sewerage, training&mdash;any of a number of essential services. Are the Democrats willing to share that responsibility with the Labor Party? I think not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are pretty simple. Labor has made a huge mess of this issue. They are making a further mess of this issue. I would strongly urge them to accept that, to cut their losses and to support the government legislation. If they do not, I will be happy to go out and expose their fraud to the Australian public. It has already been exposed. You would think they would learn something. It is no wonder they are going to be in opposition for a long time. They have not learnt anything from this sorry saga of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. We are coming in and trying to clean it up for them and for the Australian public&mdash;because at the bottom line it is taxpayers' money that is going towards this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not pass this bill, we end up back where we started. As Senator Collins said&mdash;he was quite right&mdash;Labor's amendment might do something; it might not. He is right. It will not produce finality. In relation to the legal advice that we obtained, I will again quote from the Chief General Counsel. I am pleased that Senator Cooney is here. He would accept, I am sure, the integrity of the Chief General Counsel, the integrity of the opinion of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. When asked whether, if the bill as proposed were enacted, it would be subject to challenge on the grounds of inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act, The Chief General Counsel's opinion was `No'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's get on with it. Senator Collins said that he wanted to get this over with in 10 minutes. I am happy to proceed to a ballot on

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found an interesting statement by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) today in the form of an accusation that the Labor Party were at fault or in error in their judgment in assuming that governments did not have the power to make laws which were detrimental to Aboriginal people. I guess governments can make whatever laws they like; whether they are challengeable later is the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting point the minister made was, `Ah, but you are wrong or inconsistent in your arguments'&mdash;he pointed to the Labor Party&mdash;`because you supported the ATSIC bill last year.' I was very clear in pointing out that the ATSIC bill last year was detrimental to Aboriginal people. I must have been the only person saying that the bill was detrimental to Aboriginal people. I am very glad that the minister has now admitted it, and I am sure those words will be helpful for those people who may think that that bill was challengeable because it was detrimental to Aboriginal people. So thank you, minister, for that. I did not vote for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the technical difficulties and will those difficulties come up again and again in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="259"> relation to such things as section 10? I think they may do. That is why this is not good enough. This approach that we are being asked to handle today is not good enough. Even if it were not, in my opinion, detrimental to the Ngarrindjeri people, it is detrimental to the whole issue of advancing the cause of fair treatment to every Australian. In this particular type of issue part of the answer must be that we have got to look at and give opportunity for input on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be happy to hear from the minister, from the government's point of view, exactly what kind of reviews have been taking place on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protection Act 1984, but it seems to me that that is not good if there is not the ability for people to make input. Over time, what we have seen from the coalition has been a ridiculing&mdash;I have seen it on a number of occasions in this chamber&mdash;in relation to secret business. I have heard people who are deeply religious speaking in this chamber. I remember former Senator Baden Teague showing a deep concern for the situation in East Timor with the desecration of the Host.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no sense do I wish to diminish people's beliefs, but some people might wonder what the fuss is about. They might see communion as being a fellow in a long dress holding a cup of wine. Obviously that has much more meaning for people of a Christian religion, for people who believe in sacraments and so on. That is not considered to be nonsense by a number of senators in this chamber, but there has been detrimental comment in relation to secret business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the only area in Australia where there are issues of cultural sensitivity. Instead of trying the sort of nonsense that is in this bill, maybe we have to work out a process by which we can allow comment on the issue. Maybe we should go back and work out how sensitive cultural information and values by law&mdash;whether Aboriginal law or another law, or the law of another country in fact&mdash;can be shared. It might involve a situation involving a death penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have come into this chamber saying, `Well, if it is so important, why isn't it in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> records?' How can these matters be interpreted when there is a lack of cultural understanding? Aside from that issue, how can it be said, `It was not in the record. Therefore it is not true'? It has to be said that there is a lack of understanding but that there exists sensitive cultural information that cannot be passed on except under certain conditions to certain people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the coalition is saying that that does not exist, that is a denial of Aboriginal culture. If that is what this minister is doing, if that is the viewpoint this minister is supporting, please let him say that this is the case. Whatever his viewpoint about the Ngarindjerri claim, please let him stand up and say, `This is not the case; there is no such thing as secret business'. And, if there is such a thing as secret business, how the heck is he planning to deal with it in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion we have to work out a way for people who have information about how this should be dealt with to have the opportunity to present that viewpoint so that we all as a parliament can work out how the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 can be sensibly amended to allow the sensitive handling of this kind of cultural information. If we are talking about heritage, there are many occasions, I believe, when people have not been able to speak up, have not been able to put their information forward or have had the court system used against them since the act does not enable that information to be handled sensitively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know what the government, and perhaps the Labor Party, are planning to do about this. Would they support a reasonable inquiry into this issue which will allow public input so we can get a sensible outcome and so that we do not continue to have a situation where governments try to enact a ridiculous bill which will take away the rights of a group of people? Whatever the problem is with section 10, it may still relate to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Maybe that is what we need to look at. I would like to see, if there is support from the Labor Party, some mechanism by which we can advance and allow input into the process.</PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a later act, and overrides the operation of the RDA. That is the minister's defence. For the Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to justify a piece of legislation as overriding the operation of a pre&hyphen;existing act is something that I find very hard to accept, particularly since that pre&hyphen;enacted act is the Racial  Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get this clear. The minister wants his certainty, and he claims that he gets his certainty because this act is a later act to the Racial Discrimination Act and, as a consequence, its effect overrides the operation of the previous act. It is a basic, fundamental and constitutional legal principle is what the minister is saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have contended for some time that the principles of this bill do not offend the RDA principles. Today the minister has acknowledged that the reason why there is no inconsistency with the RDA is that this legislation overrides the RDA. Not only is it offensive for the Aboriginal affairs minister to justify legislation on the basis that it overrides the principles prohibiting racial discrimination; it is also totally inconsistent with the commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to this parliament that he would not be party to the introduction of legislation which would override the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is to pick up on the point Senator Bob Collins made and to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some of the evidence of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee which I think is quite compelling. Senator Collins asked the minister whether anything could stop the construction of the bridge under the law as it now stands&mdash;without an amendment. The minister did not answer that. On page 105 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Legal and Constitution Committee, this passage appears:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator BOLKUS</EMPHASIS> &mdash;The reality of your answers has been that you do not need special legislation to stop the construction; though, you are saying that you may need special legislation to stop you having to have another reporter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to that. The question raised was: is the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act? The answer is: the bill is consistent with the RDA. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, which the bill amends, as you know, is a special measure for the purpose of the RDA, but a special measure is a measure for the positive advancement of a racial or ethnic group to ensure the group has equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special measures are exempt from the general prohibition on racial discrimination under the RDA. So the need for an extent of a special measure is a matter for parliament to decide, and this bill would give effect to a decision to narrow the scope of an existing special measure by removing Hindmarsh Island bridge from the application of the heritage legislation. That is what it has been all about, and that does not seem to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee agreed with the Attorney-General's advice that the bill is consistent with the RDA. So it is consistent. If the minister has no intention of issuing a declaration and cannot be compelled to do so by the courts, why is this legislation necessary? That is the question that was asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything that I said this morning was consistent with what I said in the constitutional and legal committee's hearings. I do not resile from any of that. What I said then was perfectly correct. Put simply, this legislation is the only way of stopping the legal merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round. If you want the legal merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round to continue, that is your decision. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the only way of preventing any further waste of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central fact is that a live application remains for a section 10 declaration.

I do not resile from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in turn means spending more money on this issue. If the legislation is not passed, the applicants may go to the courts to attempt to compel me to appoint a reporter. It is not beyond the realms of possibility&mdash;notwithstanding the Boobera Lagoon case you mentioned, Senator Bob Collins&mdash;that the courts might agree to an injunction preventing the bridge in the meantime. Senator Bolkus, you should be listening to this reply because it is answering your question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having appointed a reporter and received a report, which may or may not be subject to further legal challenge&mdash;every previous report has, as you know, been subject to a challenge&mdash;I would then need to consider the report and make a decision in accordance with the heritage act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Cooney, I agree that it is difficult. I think the answer to your question is pretty straightforward, although for non-lawyers it certainly sounds a bit confusing. But it is fairly clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act is a special measure for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act. I think we all accept that. A special measure is a measure for the positive advancement of a racial or ethnic group to ensure the group equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Special measures are exempt from the general prohibition on racial discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act. I think we all accept that. The need for and extent of the special measure is a matter for parliament to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill would give effect to a decision to narrow the scope of an existing special measure. The amendment itself is not a special measure but it does correctly narrow the scope of a special measure&mdash;I think that is where the confusion appears to arise&mdash;by removing Hindmarsh Island Bridge from the application for heritage legislation. So the amendment itself is not a special measure but, yes, it does amend a special measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal advice I have from the Chief General Counsel is that the bill is, as previously advised, not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. Obviously, there have been previous examples, Senator Cooney, where your government made laws reducing the rights of Aboriginal people under the land rights act by introducing a sunset clause on land claims and also restricting the veto over mining, presumably using the same constitutional power&mdash;although I am happy to hear argument about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those amendments, like these today, were based on the fact that special measures can be amended from time to time in light of changed circumstances. Surely it must be so. You cannot lock things in forever and a day. Those amendments can include qualifying 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them or rolling them back. Again, it is of necessity that that should be so, as indeed is contemplated under the Racial Discrimination Act and the international convention which envisages that special measures shall be temporary, not permanent. That is the nature of a special measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, in the advice from the Chief General Counsel to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department of 27 November, which I referred to in the Senate committee hearings and in fact I tabled, the Chief General Counsel indicated that there was no basis, particularly constitutional, on which a court could invalidate the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill once it passed. As I mentioned previously, this bill has been through all the normal checks and balances that any government would go through. It has been through various departments, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. So I think we have clarified that particular aspect.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is, therefore, open to the parliament to conclude that there is no longer a need for special heritage legislation to apply to a particular community or to a particular area or areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful to the minister for tabling this short advice from the Chief General Counsel. The advice was not necessary, of course. As the Chief General Counsel has pointed out in the last paragraph, he canvassed this matter at the Senate committee hearing; indeed, I have read what he said about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get on to that, and just as an indication of just how little grasp the minister has personally on any of this&mdash;unless he is handed a note or has the whole night to get a script prepared&mdash;what the minister said just a moments ago about the problem if the status quo is maintained of having an interim injunction put on, is a complete contradistinction of the evidence he gave the Senate committee on exactly the same issue. What the minister said just a few minutes ago is that if the bill does not pass, if we maintain the law as it currently is, then you run the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> risk of having another interim injunction issue, we will be back into the courts and so on. Let me advise the Senate of what the minister said on this very issue to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee at page 105:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Bolkus</EMPHASIS> &mdash;You were challenged over the refusal to issue a declaration. That led to the proceedings before Mr Justice Foster, concluded on 17 October.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Bolkus</EMPHASIS> &mdash;So the answer to the first question was yes. In those proceedings, isn't it a fact that Justice Foster found in the Federal Court on 17 October that the court could not issue an interim injunction against the activities that Hal Wooten described as `desecration' because it had no power to order you to make a declaration of protecting the lake?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Herron</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Yes, I believe that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Bolkus</EMPHASIS> &mdash;No&hyphen;one can force you by way of interim injunction to issue a declaration. No&hyphen;one has the power to force you to issue a section 10 declaration at the end of the day, so, for the bridge to go ahead, there is no real need for special legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, that Federal Court judgment, where the judge specifically found he could not even order the minister under an interim injunction, because there is no power&mdash;and you have confirmed that, Minister, and it is correct&mdash;shows there is no real need for special legislation. This bill confers upon you&mdash;as, I might add, it was intended to do by the minister and the parliament&mdash;very wide discretion. What you told the Senate this morning is in flat contradiction of what you advised the Senate committee.</PARA>

Let me remind you, Minister, of what you said just a few moments ago. What you said&mdash;legally correct and factually correct&mdash;

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in debate here yesterday, the reason you do not want to accept this amendment in the same way that you were happy to accept it with the social security migration waiting period legislation, is that, if there is a doubt, you do not want a court to be able to determine that it is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. That is what I said&mdash;this is a sledgehammer indeed to crack this egg. You and the government want the assurance that, if it is inconsistent, it will prevail over the Racial Discrimination Act, and that is exactly what the Chief General Counsel has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All honourable senators should examine this short advice.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. If the bill, as proposed, is enacted, would it be subject to challenge on the grounds of inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act? Answer: No. The bill in my opinion, as I have previously advised, is not inconsistent with the RDA. As a later act, the bill, once enacted, will prevail in any event over the Racial Discrimination Act. Hence, there will be no basis for a challenge to the bill, once enacted on RDA grounds. WA v. Commonwealth . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so on. Absolutely correct. The whole argument you are relying on, and you ran it this morning&mdash;I am quite happy to hear that from the Attorney&hyphen;General, but I find it highly offensive hearing it run by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;is that it is not inconsistent in the sense that, because this bill, if enacted, is a later Commonwealth enactment, if it is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, it will prevail over that act to the extent of any inconsistency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a recollection of the precise details of any discussions that I had with Mr McDonald, and nor was I privy to any discussions he may or may not have had with the Prime Minister. The essence of that comment in the submission was that the government itself, because of the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that there would be nothing improper in any event in it being canvassed. But I do not recall whether it was or not. Certainly the discussions with Mr McDonald were at a very superficial level in the sense that he was simply asked whether he was prepared to take on the position on the merits. The government did not in any way indicate to him that he was expected to ensure any particular outcome or approach. Quite clearly, I would have been interested in canvassing Mr McDonald's views on the ABC, its capacity to change and the importance of the ABC as a national cultural institution. But beyond that, I am not able, nor do I think it appropriate, to go into any further detail about potentially private discussions.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Certainly not. Mr McDonald's appointment was not made on any conditions. There was a widespread view in the ABC itself, even prior to the expiry of Mark Armstrong's term, that the ABC needed to look to its financial position. I think you will find that Brian Johns was on the public record prior to 23 July talking about the need for fundamental change and indeed canvassing the fact that they had overspent their budget over a period of five years and that there needed to be some significant changes to the system. The best way for them to achieve that would have been to have conducted an internal inquiry or to have commissioned outside expert advice. That is what I understand they did. Price Waterhouse was commissioned. It certainly was not on the basis of any suggestions on our part about who should undertake any inquiry, and nor was our opinion sought on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. With the Wik decision affirming the coexistence of native title on pastoral leases, leaseholders now find that they have lost many rights other than for grazing activities and have had doubts cast on many accepted grazing practices, including the loss of management autonomy and development rights, and access to water supply, bores and dams. According to legal advice, they can no longer sell or auction their land, remove quarry material, allow broadacre clearing or have farm tourism, plus there are losses in asset value, with banks publicly concerned about effects on pastoralists' income generation. Would the government consider compensation for any rights finally lost by pastoral leaseholders who acquired their leases in good faith and have had their rights extinguished because of the Wik decision?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for his question. I can understand the legitimate concern that he and others have raised regarding native title and the Wik decision in particular. The coalition government position has always been that the Native Title Act in its current form proved to be unworkable and required amendment. We are very concerned about the uncertainty which now exists following the Wik decision of the High Court and its wide implications for land management, some of which were outlined by Senator Boswell. We have been particularly concerned about the anxiety and hardship that has been caused by the continuing uncertainty to indigenous people, pastoral industry developers and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's Wik decision does not in itself call into question the validity of leases or pastoralists' ability to exercise their rights, whether they were granted under a lease or through the relevant land act. There is, however&mdash;this is what Senator Boswell was alluding to&mdash;the possibility that the Native Title Act, as it stands, may effectively reverse the High Court's view that the rights of pastoralists prevail over those of native titleholders where they are inconsistent. Advice from the Attorney-General's Depart 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="271"> ment which has been released suggests that the issue is very real for pastoralists, the mining industry and state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the uncertainty which now exists, we are currently seeking a fair and just resolution that will provide a stable foundation for economic development that is so important to the future of all Australians. Senator Boswell will be aware that the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, are now consulting widely with state and territory governments, indigenous groups, pastoralist organisations and the mining industry. Any solution must be one which is based on racial equality and basic fairness and justice but which also promotes Australia's national interest, which obviously includes economic interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision fundamentally changes one of the key understandings of the Native Title Act in that it was never envisaged that the grant of a leasehold estate did not extinguish native title. In fact, it is worth remembering that it was the former Labor government that gave explicit assurances of this to the pastoral and mining industries.</PARA>

Yesterday you said that Radio Australia now has an audience of less than five million, but no-one can really tell you what the actual audience levels are at the present time. Is it not a fact that the figure of 100 million given to the 1981 Dix review of the ABC was a guesstimate made in the absence of any survey research? Is it not a fact that, as the head of audience research at Radio Australia has pointed out, the 20 million figure which you used on 24 January excludes the two most populous countries in the world, India and China? In view of these uncertainties in your use yesterday of a new figure of five million, what precisely is the best estimate of Radio Australia's audience?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It sounds to me as though Senator Lundy has not bothered to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="272"> read pages 41 and 42 of the Mansfield report because it is all spelt out there. What Mansfield says is that in 1981 the audience reach was estimated at 100 million and today it is now estimated to be 20 million. The actual audience, which is much less than the audience reach&mdash;in other words, the actual rather than the potential&mdash;is something of the order five million, but no-one can be sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reasonable, I would have thought, to expect that Radio Australia would have some idea of the actual audience reach and, indeed, I thought I canvassed this yesterday. I think on page 41 Mansfield goes into a rough breakdown of the figures. I think from memory there is something like 2.8 million for Indonesia, a million for PNG and 0.8 million&mdash;in other words, 800,000&mdash;for the People's Republic of China. I do not know where you get the suggestion that the figure excludes audiences in India or China. Certainly Mansfield does not say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mansfield does say is that the onus is on those involved to demonstrate that Radio Australia has continuing relevance. No&hyphen;one is saying that Radio Australia ought to be put out of business or that somehow there is not a role for Australia in the region. The real questions are: in what manner can Australia be most effective in the region; are there a number of others already providing the same sorts of services; and is this really value for money in terms of the scarce resources available to the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, Mansfield says quite clearly that the ABC can well and truly cope on half a billion dollars a year. It has then got to cut its cloth accordingly. If it has to make a choice between domestic and international, in his view the Australian public would clearly come down on the side of the domestic service. That is not to say that he is recommending the abolition of Radio Australia. Indeed, he says that they ought to have the ability to continue to provide that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask yourselves the hard questions and look at whether or not it is being effective. If the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not able to say that unequivocally then you start to see the dimensions of the

Why don't we have more of that? Why don't we have our own satellite service in the region?' These things all cost money&mdash;$20 million is the cost of Radio Australia improving transmission services at the present time. Mansfield simply invites you to make the hard decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very interesting question. I am only disappointed I did not have more notice of it, though it was quite sufficient. But the fact is, as we know, that there are privacy considerations that apply to the department and, therefore, it has to be sensitive about the release of certain submissions. Indeed, some people might have personal or confidential information that they would not want to have see the light of day. They might want to put in various matters that somehow are very personal to them, reflecting their own experiences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would have thought that the vast majority of the 10,115 people who put in submissions were putting them forward because they thought that they were contributing to the public debate. In those circumstances, I would have thought it only reasonable to ask the question: what have those who refused to disclose their submissions got to hide? As we know, back in about mid&hyphen;August, Hugh Mackay, eminent Australian and until recently the deputy chair of the Australia Council, writing in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, said, `Who is the opposition spokesman on the ABC?' I suppose Senator Schacht managed to read that, because he said, `Would you believe me if I said it was Senator Schacht?' I believe him, but I am not sure too many others did. Undoubtedly, Senator Schacht read this and he thought, `For heaven's sake, I only have two weeks to go

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as we know, from discussion in the parliament on 16 September, he kicked the best own goal in history by volunteering that 11,000 people had managed to get their submissions in, but he had not and he would be putting one in shortly. He said:</PARA>

The case referred to is a state law prosecution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Eggleston very much for that question. Senator Eggleston has always had a great interest in the mining and resources industry because of the many years that he spent as a general practitioner in the Pilbara region. He, if anyone, knows the benefits that flow not just as export income but also the regional benefits that come to small business and the job creation that goes on when all these developments take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This renewed confidence now evident in our minerals and oil and gas industries comes from the certainty and solid management that is a hallmark of the Howard government, which is totally focused on real job creation. Today's optimism about these industries contrasts sharply with the deepening pessimism fostered by Labor's continued attacks on these industries, particularly by the fringe lunatic groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just heard an interjection, `What about families?' The Labor Party has never understood that probably the most important things in the minds of families are security and the creation of real jobs. They are the things on which the family hinges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confidence in our minerals industry is absolutely vital to Australia. It provides the climate for investment and that means direct and permanent jobs in new mining and oil and gas developments, and&mdash;I might say&mdash;thousands and thousands of service jobs.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="281"> nothing about the boost to the local and regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These industries are all major export industries. Every new project means more exports and a major contribution to lowering Australia's international debt. Remember the great debt the Labor Party created? This is another problem that the Howard government has had to confront along with the black hole and the Native Title Act. This is one of the major problems that we have had to address because of 13 years of misrule. This is why this government is determined to encourage the development of the resources sector which&mdash;we all should know&mdash;is vital to Australia's prosperity, a fact that seems to have escaped some of industry's opponents. We want to get away from unnecessary impediments to allow development to continue. We have to reduce perceptions of sovereign risk.</PARA>

She asserted that the Commonwealth took a decision on the basis of principle and that that principle was applied clearly and transparently. She made it very clear that it was her view and the government's view that the federal government had not made a mistake as to how their figures and their formula applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the minister to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 22 January when the ACT Attorney-General, not just someone of her own party 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but also someone of her own faction, made it clear in a leaked letter&mdash;I do not say that Gary Humphries leaked it&mdash;from the Commonwealth Attorney-General to his ACT counterpart Mr Williams admitted that the government got its sums wrong. Senator Vanstone, I suggest to you that, straight after this question time, you ought to get back to your office and get your answer clarified by the AG's office. Not only has Gary Humphries had correspondence in which the Commonwealth Attorney-General acknowledges that they got the figures wrong but it is my information that Gary Humphries is not the only one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have we got faulty figures but we have a faulty principle. And hasn't it been exposed pretty well in the last 24 hours? You have a suspected international drug runner who has been the subject of joint investigations and cooperative agreements. You use Commonwealth and state organisations to track these drug runners down: there is cooperation in targeting suspects, there is cooperation in getting the evidence together and there is cooperation in getting these people to go to court. As happens so often, you may not be able to pin them on some charges so you get them on others. Yet, with the cooperative spirit of law enforcement in this country, this person was charged under state law and not under Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know, under your principle they would never have got Al Capone because he could have claimed a jurisdictional excuse. When it comes to drug running, international crime or national crime you cannot draw a distinction between a state responsibility and an international one. Not only do I say that, but it was the experience of the Costigan royal commission some 10 years ago that drug networks do not run any longer in terms of a province, a suburb and a state. They are international and they are national. There needs to be that national cooperation in order to pursue them and to prosecute them. As I said, it has been a long&hyphen;term practice of law enforcement in this country that if you cannot get them in respect of some charges you sting them in respect of others. What this decision by the Commonwealth shows very clearly is that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me dispel one myth which has been put forward by Senator Bolkus and that is that the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) got the figures wrong in relation to legal aid. What happened was that the figures which the Commonwealth used were the 1994&hyphen;95 figures. They were the only figures available at the time and they were provided by the states. Since then, the 1995&hyphen;96 figures have become available and the Commonwealth has reassessed the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee on this very point in Brisbane just recently, where there was a revision of the intended cuts to the Queens 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land Legal Aid Commission. The intended cut, they said, was in the region of $4.9 million and that was reduced to $0.9 million as a result of the revision of those figures. So the Attorney&hyphen;General did not get any figures wrong. Senator Bolkus is quite wrong in that respect. The Attorney&hyphen;General was operating on the only figures available at the time and those figures had to come from the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of this man's trial having to be aborted because of a lack of Commonwealth funding is entirely spurious. It is precisely because, in the past, Commonwealth funds have been diverted to subsidise the cost of state criminal law matters that the Commonwealth has limited its funding for legal aid services. In that respect, the Commonwealth estimates that there was a $10 million subsidy of state matters by the Commonwealth in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the Commonwealth says is that we were not only funding Commonwealth matters, but&mdash;to the tune of $10 million&mdash;we were also funding state matters. That, I think, is an important point to remember because it demonstrates that the Commonwealth was not only funding representation for laws that it promulgated, but it was also providing funding for laws which the states themselves promulgated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the principle that if a government enacts legislation then it should provide the legal aid for the representation in relation to that legislation. It is also a fact, I am advised, that the New South Wales state government has refused to pay for all matters for which it is responsible, particularly criminal law matters. That has forced the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission to plan for a substantial reduction in next year's funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission met this morning&mdash;I am not aware of the outcome&mdash;to discuss Mr Udovicic's case and the funding for that. What Senator Bolkus cleverly fails to point out is that there is an inquiry which the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee is conducting at the moment from which evidence is forthcoming, that there is ongoing negotiation between the Commonwealth and the states via the attorneys&hyphen;general and their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="286"> offices, and that the Commonwealth has indicated that it is only too willing to arrive at a negotiated agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence in Canberra the Commonwealth indicated, via the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, that there was a problem getting the states to the bargaining table and that it was the Commonwealth that was anxious to resolve matters and to sort this funding question out. Therefore, it is not a matter for the Commonwealth but a matter very much for the government of New South Wales in relation to this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, over the next couple of months, the states and the Commonwealth can arrive at a solution in relation to the legal aid question and the question of next year's funding. It is a point that there is funding in New South Wales which involves the Commonwealth paying for state matters and that points to a derogation of responsibility on the part of the New South Wales government. So perhaps Senator Bolkus should address his remarks to the state government of New South Wales and not the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address some remarks to the motion to take note of the answer given by Senator Vanstone. I would also like to join with Senator Ellison in expressing the wish that Commonwealth and state attorneys get together in coming months to overcome the problem that there is truly a crisis in the legal aid industry in Australia or, indeed, wider than that, in the justice system in Australia. The focal point of my question to the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Vanstone) was New South Wales and the possible release of a person who is charged with the possession of a very large amount of heroin because there are no legal aid funds available to give that person legal advice or representation before a judge in a future trial. That truly is a worry for the citizens of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unique to New South Wales. The same concerns have been expressed in every state and territory in the Commonwealth. The unfortunate part about this is that the decisions of the attorney and of the cabinet are based on faulty figures. That is clearly admit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ted, and was clearly admitted by the attorney himself in a letter to each of the state Attorneys&hyphen;General&mdash;we have copies of those letters on file.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not arguing in committee here. As Senator Ellison said previously, in Queensland the Commonwealth has not only admitted that they based their calculations on faulty figures but they have gone to the extent of reinstating something like $4 million to the promised funding from 1 July this year. As Senator Ellison said, the proposed cut for Queensland was $4.9 million. In the hearing in Brisbane last week we were told that the cuts are now only going to be in the order of $0.9 million. We also got evidence from the Attorney&hyphen;General in the Australian Capital Territory that the Commonwealth has admitted that the figures on which the calculations were based were not accurate figures, but that those figures will not be reinstituted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in the Northern Territory where we took evidence two weeks ago, we were told that the Commonwealth has admitted that it made some errors in the calculations, not only errors based on the figures that were available but errors on what were territory matters and Commonwealth matters as they impinged on the Northern Territory. There has been no offer to reinstate the funding that should have been due to them prior to the cabinet decision of last year to cut $120 million from the legal aid system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria last Friday morning I attended a forum. Again, we were told there that the earlier figures were based on faulty figures but there has been no promise to reintroduce the funding. It will appear at this point, although evidence still has to be taken by the committee in five of the other states, that Queensland, at this stage, is the only state to get its funding partly restored. It is my understanding that all other states are at the same level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are truly in a crisis. The focus of the crisis in the legal aid industry today is about a person who is allegedly in possession of drugs in New South Wales. But it comes even closer to home. In response to my question, Senator Vanstone said that the cuts do not come into effect until 1 July. Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="287"> Vanstone, as a legally trained person, would know that legal aid commissions right around Australia, in every state and territory, are now budgeting on the cuts that the attorney told them they were going to have in August last year. They are already imposing cuts to the funding of family law cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard of a case in Victoria last week where the money ran out for a particular litigant in the Family Court, right at the time when her case needed to cross&hyphen;examine her opponent&mdash;her ex&hyphen;partner&mdash;who was accused of physical violence against her. She had to get up and represent herself because the legal aid funds had run out. This is not next year, it is not from 1 July&mdash;it is this year. I hope this parliament will not have the blood of some poor individual on their hands merely because of the absence of legal aid funding and representation in the courts by virtue of this cabinet decision.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan's over&hyphen;dramatisation did his cause no good. Nor did he do his cause any good when he added supplementary and quite unnecessary padding to his question to the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Vanstone). There is no doubt that the question of legal aid is a matter of concern within the community at large and of particular concern to a number of senators who are part of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee which is inquiring into this very matter. Sure it is an emotional topic. It is good to try to grab headlines, but to suggest that there might be blood as a result of a government decision on funding is really, Senator McKiernan, doing your cause no good and does no justice to some of the difficulties that governments go through from time to time when they try to negotiate an agreement with the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, when you look at the debate and go to the states, to note that it is the Labor parties&mdash;because they are mainly in opposition these days&mdash;who are attacking the state governments, saying that they should get the situation right, and federally the Labor Party is blaming the federal government. It is a situation that needs to be worked out and dealt with. I think we are moving in the right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> direction. The first situation that has to be debunked absolutely is the assertion that the Commonwealth dealt with faulty figures. The reality is that they dealt with figures that were accurate. They were the figures for 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of certain assessments being made, the 1994-95 figures were the only ones available and they indicated a subsidy to the states and territories of about $33 million. The legal aid commissions, I believe quite properly, indicated to the government that those figures may no longer represent the situation from their own experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, what has occurred is that the 1995-96 figures have now come to hand which indicate that the $33 million subsidy from 1994-95 is a little bit less in the 1995-96 year. So that needs to be factored in. To say that the government dealt with faulty figures is wrong. What it dealt with were the previous year's figures because the other figures were not to hand as yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I gratuitously suggest to Senator Bolkus in particular that it is of no credit to him or anybody else to try to use an individual's case to get cheap headlines to try to make cheap political capital. First, you have the problem of sub judice, and I think Senator Bolkus may have skated very close to it with some of his comments. I commend Senator McKiernan for using the word `alleged' in his comments, but if we do want to use individual examples and get excited about them, there is a duty on us senators to be very careful in the way we express ourselves in using those individual examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting that Senator McKiernan talked about blood and Senator Bolkus talked about drug importation without, in the whole context, acknowledging any responsibility for the government's financial dilemma. Remember you went to the people saying that the budget was in surplus. We came into government and found a $10 billion shortfall. We had to look around to save and to try to share the balance of funding in matters between the Commonwealth and states. Where we had been funding somewhat more generously than the states we thought the equation should be evened out. The only reason for having to go on these exercises, Senator McKiernan and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="288"> Senator Bolkus, is your government's previous mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a government would be delighted if we had an extra $100 million to spend on legal aid. But you guys in the Labor Party should have recognised the problems that you would cause this nation by your overspending, especially in your last couple of years in government. That is the root cause of this problem. If you want to talk about blood, it will be on your head, not on ours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy President, that is a very serious proposition to put. You yourself have had experience of visiting people in prison, people who you may well have thought had not been properly defended. To have to go to somebody who has been in gaol for 10 years or more, or even less, and say, `Look, you're doing time. Your career's ruined. Your reputation's gone. But, against that, there's been a saving to government, and you've got to realise that government has fairly heavy demands upon it for all sorts of things. Unfortunately, we've had to let you go to gaol but you will be well pleased that you've saved the government some thousands of dollars,' whether that government be Commonwealth or state. That is, in my view, a consideration that should never arise. In other words, the financial state that the government finds itself in should never be a factor in deciding whether people get justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, it is very interesting to hear what Mr Michael Rozenes had to say on his leaving the position of Director of Public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prosecutions at the end of last month. Mr Michael Rozenes is a man of undoubted ability as a lawyer. He was an outstanding defence counsel before he became the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth and, I think it is conceded, performed outstandingly well while he was in the position of Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rozenes said that, in so far as the prosecution of people was concerned, he had never failed to have adequate resources. In other words, he has always had adequate resources to prosecute people. He then went on to say that he, unfortunately, could not say the same for the defence. In other words, the people accused had not always had the resources adequate for their proper defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation that faces this Senate, this parliament and this country. We are now arguing about whether the federal government, any particular state government or, for that matter, any territory government, should pay for the proper carrying out of justice. That is what we are arguing about&mdash;as to who should do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are arguing about that, the system is coming under strain. It is getting to the point where it is becoming a scandal. The way that the justice system in Australia is operating at the moment is less than adequate. It is not a matter&mdash;this is a phrase that is often used&mdash;of a Rolls Royce system; it is a matter of a very bad system getting worse. I say this in fairness to the legal profession. The only reason it is running as well as it is is that the legal profession is subsidising what is really the responsibility of government. If the legal profession of this country were not doing what it is now in subsidising this system&mdash;the system that the government should be running&mdash;it would not be a scandal but a shambles. It would not be running correctly. The whole society in which we operate would be under furious attack.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="289"> and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today, relating to the distribution of funds for vocational studies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to ask what we are to make of a government that says it supports Australia's battlers but then chooses to sit back and do nothing about vocational studies funding arrangements, whereby five times the amount of funding is going to private school students compared with state school students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says, as usual, that it is up to the states. Last year, the Australian Secondary Principals Association was  assured by officials from DEETYA and the minister's own staff that the inequity being perpetuated by this government in relation to its general funds for schools would not extend to funding vocational training studies. This is an assurance that the minister now chooses to forget. The principals went away with those undertakings. Now they discover that the funds have been allocated by ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, not on the basis of merit or the location of particular programs and not even on a per capita basis but rather on the proportion of year 11 and 12 students&mdash;I gather this figure was prior to 1996 last year&mdash;in each school sector. That occurred irrespective of the actual number of students in vocational studies programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian figures, which were confirmed in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>by the secretary of the Victorian Department of Education, Mr Geoff Spring, demonstrate the unfairness of this arrangement. I will quote them. The independent sector received $764,000 for just 440 students; that is around $1,730 per student. The Catholic sector received $996,000 for 2,300 students; that is around $433 per student. In the government sector, $2,873,000 was given for 9,600 students; that is $300 per student. I might add that, in the electorate of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), Brighton Grammar will be receiving $1,700 for its  students while, down the road, Brighton Secondary College will receive just $300.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unacceptable for the minister to come in here and suggest that there are no other figures for the other states. I ask how ac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countable that is. I will be pressing the minister to give those figures at the earliest possible date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this inequity grossly unfair on its face but its unfairness is compounded by several other features. Firstly, generally the more disadvantaged students undertake vocational studies programs. The vast majority of them are in government schools. They are also students who will not expect to go to university. Secondly, it does not take into account the particular nature or location of a program. For example, a program might be slightly more expensive because it includes additional features, the school is in a low income area or it has a very high proportion of non-English speaking families. Thirdly, many vocational studies programs in the government sector are run in schools in very disadvantaged areas. Those schools already tend to be under&hyphen;resourced. This sort of inequitable funding further exacerbates that disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Minister Kemp has gone to great lengths to trumpet the importance of the coalition's pathways to jobs program and to endorse the notion that vocational studies and training in secondary schools are an important feature of bringing down high youth unemployment levels. Of course we agree with that. We already know that youth unemployment is much higher in low income and disadvantaged areas. We already know that educational disadvantage is a direct consequence of low income. Just last week, ASPA revealed that retention rates are also directly linked with that income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given these three things, it would seem to me, and I suspect most other Australians, that the government should not be seeking to advantage private school vocational studies students at the expense of state schools. I urge the government to address this inequity not next year or by the year 2000 but right now.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It was most fortuitous that yesterday we were able to give notice of a motion to come on for general business today. The motion concerns the Mansfield report and the future of the ABC. Yesterday we had this most extraordinary and convoluted defence by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) of his own cabinet document, which he partially disowned. He partially said that he could not remember whether he signed it or not, and said that the covering note was wrong and written by somebody unnamed whom he disowned but would not identify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary situation. In my time in the Senate I have never heard a minister of any party disown or refuse to accept a cabinet submission lodged in their name in the cabinet process, or reject it and say that what was in it was wrong when they lodged it and they approved of it under the cabinet process. But that just goes to the core of the matter of this minister and this government in its treatment of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My motion, now before us as general business, is to deal with the Mansfield report. There is no doubt from the leaked cabinet document from last year that this minister, Senator Alston, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) wanted a quite different result from what Mr Mansfield delivered. They wanted, according to the cabinet submission, political control of the ABC. There are phrases throughout that leaked cabinet document that indicate that they want a redefined ABC, they want reduced funding, they want something that will give them an opportunity to directly and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="294"> indirectly influence the running of the ABC and its programming content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During much of last year, both before and after the Mansfield review was announced and before and after the draconian cuts of $55 million a year were announced&mdash;before the Mansfield review had even begun&mdash;there were remarks by the Prime Minister, the minister himself and the Treasurer attacking the ABC, its content and its performance. This minister, of course, the year before, as chairman of a Senate committee, when in opposition signed off on a Senate report about the ABC which supported the ABC's programming&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator Carr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We reminded him about that too!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We reminded him about that on several occasions. He signed off on a report saying that the management was doing a good job and that the funding had to be maintained. That was when he was in opposition during 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he becomes the minister, he immediately launches a vicious attack with the full support of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the ABC. They succeeded in cutting $55 million per year off the budget over the next four years. In total, with other efficiency dividends, this is $209 million straight off the budget of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaked cabinet document shows that Mr Mansfield's role was actually to justify the cuts post the decision to make the cuts. Even Mr Mansfield, if you read between the lines in his report, indicates that that is the wrong way to go about any review. You would normally have the review and the recommendations, and then see, because of those recommendations, what the funding should be. This government does it the other way round: cut, cut, cut, then have a review to justify your cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hasn't the government got a real shock from what Mr Mansfield came down with? Mr Mansfield clearly, and quite rightly, has not stuck to the letter of the very restricted terms of reference he was given. If he had followed them right through very narrowly, this report would have been quite different. At the time the terms of reference were an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nounced we in opposition criticised them because they were aimed at getting a political outcome to meet the political wishes of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the minister&mdash;contrary to all their promises before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recommendations, Mr Mansfield has rejected a narrower focus for the ABC. In recommendation No. 3, dealing with the role and the functions of the ABC, he has recognised the ABC as having to have a broad role in the community as a broadcaster. So straight off, in one of these most important recommendations, he rejects the ideological attacks on the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Mr Mansfield is proud of the fact that he actually wrote the report himself; he did not rely on a team of experts and so on, producing volumes and volumes of appendices, et cetera. He wrote a succinct report of around 50 pages, which is very readable. It has a common theme through  it, overwhelmingly defending the ABC, as the people of Australia would want it. He says in his report that he was amazed at the strength of support in our community for the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He points out that he received 10,600 submissions as of 10 December 1996. He points out that, overwhelmingly, those submissions were in support of the ABC. Those that were critical of the ABC ranked at no more than one or two per cent of the nearly 11,000 submissions. So the evidence given to him from the community was absolutely contrary to the ideological obsessions of this government, led by the Prime Minister, the minister and the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made the comment on the public record, in interviews, that, as a person who has come from the private sector&mdash;as a person who has had a distinguished career in the private sector&mdash;you would give anything to have brand loyalty for your product that the ABC has. He makes the point very strongly that the support for the ABC in Australia is unparalleled to the support for any of our other public or private institutions. That shows that what this government is on about has been completely misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great credit to the Australian people that they responded so strongly over the six 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="295"> months in their submissions. I recollect that a few weeks before the end of last year the minister admitted in this place that he had received 17,000 submissions or letters of protest concerning cuts to the ABC. That is 17,000 letters to the minister and 11,000 to Mr Mansfield&mdash;28,000 submissions. That is an unparalleled number of submissions from the public, overwhelmingly&mdash;nearly 100 per cent of them&mdash;opposed to what the government was doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Mansfield has also commented upon publicly and privately&mdash;he was very generous with his time when he came to see me and Mr Beazley, representing the opposition&mdash;was that the letters were not all pro forma. People had sat down and written, with passion and conviction, their own submissions about the ABC and why it had to be maintained. I think that certainly had a great influence on him in making his recommendations. Recommendation No. 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the principal function of the ABC should be defined as broadcasting for general reception within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, it should be a comprehensive broadcaster to all Australians. That was bottom line opposition policy. It has been the Labor Party policy for the ABC for decades. The ABC is a comprehensive broadcaster. So Mr Mansfield rejected the position of the government in trying to fix the terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of funding he said that the government should re-establish the triennium funding arrangements for the ABC for 1997&hyphen;98 onwards. It was the Labor government in office that established triennium funding for the ABC for the first time. In its first six months in office, this government breaks its commitment to triennium funding&mdash;its promise in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS> to maintain funding and the triennium process&mdash;and takes $55 million off the base. That will be the base for the triennium funding for the next three years&mdash;a total of $209 million. He says that the triennium funding has to be re-established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield was given a couple of very nasty positions to have to deal with. How does the ABC survive with these imposed cuts, these draconian cuts, these cuts made without rationality, of $55 million a year? He 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanted to report clearly. I would have hoped that he might have rejected the cuts, but he accepted the cuts because that is what the government wanted, and he had to find further savings in his report. Already the ABC has identified cuts of $28 million. That $28 million is costing nearly 900 jobs in the ABC across the board. It has reduced programming, particularly in metropolitan radio services across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was still nearly $25 million to be found. In the end he had to make Hobson's choice. He said, `I received fewer submissions about the future of Radio Australia than I did about any other area.' That is not surprising. The people who listen to Radio Australia are not in Australia; they are overseas. Most of those people do not have access to the means of putting in a submission as to why they want Radio Australia to continue. Mr Mansfield said that Radio Australia should be abolished and that Australia Television should be abolished and the savings maintained for the ABC to make up that remaining black hole in the cuts. That is how you get to $55 million&mdash;by abolishing the external broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it was a decision he would have liked taking, or a recommendation that he liked making. But one thing is clear: already the Australian public is not accepting that Australia should not have an external broadcasting service. We in the opposition want to have a comprehensive external broadcasting service to service Australia's needs&mdash;not only in Australia's national interests but also in the interests particularly of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, remembering that Radio Australia is listened to consistently across the Asia&hyphen;Pacific and the rest of the world. In fact, people believe what it says. It is not a propaganda statement for the Australian government as are some of the other short wave radio broadcasting services that governments have run&mdash;and still run. The ABC and Radio Australia have credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will argue strongly that funding should be maintained, preferably within the ABC, for independent external broadcasting, and that includes television. We do not accept the minister's glib line, `Well, short wave radio 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="296"> is disappearing, reducing in listeners; therefore the technology is outdated and we should abolish it'. The reality is that if short wave is going out of business, what do we replace it with so that Australia's voice can be heard in the region with which our future is so inextricably linked? So we will defend very strongly the need to have an external broadcaster. But we acknowledge that Mr Mansfield was put in a very difficult position when he had to make that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other recommendation Mr Mansfield made which we take issue with and will not accept in its entirety relates to the outsourcing of production. We believe the ABC must maintain critical mass and have the capacity to produce Australian drama on television and radio for broadcasting across the ABC network. If it is all outsourced the ABC will lose the ability to have a creative influence; it will lose the ability to contest whether what is being proposed by the private sector is cost efficient, and it will also lose its independence when it comes to making programs that no&hyphen;one else will want to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can anyone imagine a private sector organisation going along to Channels 9, 7 or 10 and saying, `We want to show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> on your channel'? Of course not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> is a comedy which makes a point in a wonderful way about the vagaries and the cynicism of current affairs television in the commercial sector in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> was made by a group outside the ABC who went to the ABC knowing that it would be the only broadcaster game enough to fund and show it. That is why we have to have creative content in the ABC; otherwise there could be many programs that will not be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the Christmas break I noticed that the ABC replayed a couple of its most famous successes, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brides of Christ</EMPHASIS>. Can anyone imagine outside sources coming up with the idea to make a program such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brides of Christ</EMPHASIS>? That was an internal ABC production that has had enormous critical acclaim. Every time it is replayed, people watch it again. There was also the replay of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scales of Justice</EMPHASIS>. Even though it is 13 or 14 years since it was first shown, it is still as relevant today because&mdash;</PARA>

That is why we have to maintain critical mass inside the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if we allow some programs to be made under contract in the private sector, the opposition still believes the tenders should be tested against inside costings. For example, if a particular concept goes to the private sector for tender, in&hyphen;house production at the ABC should also be able to tender for it to test that the pricing and the creative instinct is what it is supposed to be. The ABC should not be left totally dependent on the private sector when making its TV dramas. My only other comment would be that we would all like to see the ABC have more money to make those sorts of world&hyphen;famous TV drama productions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the two main areas we disagree with Mr Mansfield about&mdash;external broadcasting, Radio Australia and ATV, which we believe he was forced to recommend to try to show how the cuts could be digested, and outsourcing, with which we have to disagree, although I have to say that Mr Mansfield gave considerable latitude to the management of the ABC and the board. He said that outsourcing should be at least 51 per cent, but that the actual percentage should be a matter for the board. It was not a draconian all&hyphen;or&hyphen;nothing recommendation. But he made it clear it is a matter that should be left to the board to carry out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we see in the press yesterday? We saw the most extraordinary bullyboy performance by this minister yesterday when he said to the board of the ABC at its meeting, `If you don't accept completely all outsourcing of TV drama, we won't give you any money for digitisation and modernisation on the technical side, on the equipment side of the ABC.' That is direct interference, and it threatens and blackmails the ABC when he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="297"> says, `Either do what I want or we cut the money even further.' In his report Mr Mansfield makes it clear that the ABC should get some special one&hyphen;off funding to help with the digitisation program. He actually recommends increased funding for this specific area of the ABC. But this bull&hyphen;headed, bullying minister says, `If you don't do exactly as I want on all outsourcing, you won't get any money for digitisation.' He also says, `Any government of any persuasion would have rocks in their head to give you the money unless you accept complete outsourcing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the minister that a Labor government in the future will never blackmail the independent board of the ABC to say, `You will spend the money how we say or we cut it off.' That is contrary to the act itself and the guaranteed independence of the board. This minister does not understand the independence in the charter of the ABC. He is about nobbling it, about threatening it, about getting a political outcome. That outcome is explained clearly in the cabinet submission of July last year that has been leaked.</PARA>

It would be either a black comedy or a straight comedy&mdash;I don't know which. It would certainly be bizarre to see him in a drama.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People say overseas, `This has to be pure fiction.' Here is a minister saying that he did not sign his cabinet submission, that he disagrees with the front page of his own cabinet submission. `It is a kerbside` quote. Some bureaucrat made it, but I forgot to change it; I disagreed with it.' For a minister to try to get around his own submission by saying that he did not write it would be seen overseas as something that only a minister from a fourth world political regime would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say&mdash;maybe in the back end of Ethiopia&mdash;not a minister from a first world country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the attention of the Senate not only the summary&mdash;the document itself&mdash;but volume 2, which is a summary of all the submissions received and the details of what they talk about and the range of them. If you look through those pages at the beginning of volume 2, you will actually see very effectively laid out what the Australian people believe about their ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 9, it is interesting to note that under a section called `Favourable quotes', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small number of responsibilities were primarily critical of the ABC or suggested significant diminution of the ABC's role and services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How many? Thirty&hyphen;two out of 11,615 wrote in in line with the government's view that the funding should be reduced and the ABC should be curtailed. That is an astonishing number. You would have thought that Senator Alston, being a political animal, might have actually got half a dozen Liberal branches to write in. I would have thought that he would have got a few of his backbenchers to write in to at least get it into triple figures. The reason he could not and why they did not turn up is that most Liberal Party supporters disagree with their own government on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that anyone who looks at the survey figures of the ABC and its listenership&mdash;any market research over many years&mdash;will see that, despite all the paranoia on the other side about left&hyphen;wing bias in the ABC, the majority of its listeners are conservative voters supporting either the Liberal Party or the National Party. Despite all this so-called left&hyphen;wing bias, the people who consistently listen to it and appreciate it are overwhelmingly Liberal Party voters. So, supposedly, the left&hyphen;wing bar has not done much because they keep voting for the Liberal Party. It just shows you what a joke this is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go out to the bush, in the regional areas overwhelmingly the defence of the ABC is from people who vote National Party. What has happened is that overwhelmingly the Liberal Party supporters have dumped on their own minister and Prime Minister. You

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some Liberal members, such as Mr Bradford from the Gold Coast area, say Triple J should be abolished. A Liberal member of this parliament wants Triple J closed down. Page 9 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The areas of ABC activity which prompted the more significant levels of response were the ABC radio networks Classic FM, Radio National and Triple J. Altogether, ABC domestic radio services received 11 217 favourable comments. ABC&hyphen;TV received, by comparison, 2 809. A summary . . . is provided in Table 5 on page 13.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It just shows how out of touch the government is. Overwhelmingly the specialised radio work services were supported by their listeners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Triple J, for example, is commented on very favourably by Mr Mansfield. As an organisation with a very small staff and a running cost of about $3 million per annum, it services 2.5 million listeners across Australia every week. Half the total radio listenership of the ABC are Triple J listeners. As Mr Mansfield commented when he first got this job, his own son said to him, `Dad if you recommend the abolition of Triple J, I'll get lynched.' That was the response from his son. I have to say that for most of us who have either teenagers or children like I have in their early twenties, the one comment they make is: will this government be mad enough to turn off Triple J?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Mansfield made it very clear that Triple J is not only a successful radio station 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but also a service to young people. With its spread into the rural area, under a Labor government policy going back to 1989, Triple J is now a national network not just for the cities but in rural areas. Rural people want Triple J to continue because it encourages their young people to stay in the bush. They have a service that they know gives them the same sort of information, music and interest issues for young people as their young city counterparts. They want Triple J.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government in the last budget stopped the expansion of Triple J. That is what they did in the last budget because some idiots, like Mr Bradfield, do not like occasional bad language.</PARA>

They were starkly laid out. That is what this government wanted. It wanted to close down the services because occasionally, apparently, they do not like some of the comment that is broadcast on these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my time now comes to an end, for the overwhelming recommendations the opposition compliments and congratulates Mr Mansfield. Firstly, he rejected the ideological obsessions of the government that commissioned him to try to fix the ABC. Secondly, he recognised the overwhelming support of the Australian people for a comprehensive and diverse ABC. Thirdly, he has come up with significant and well thought out ideas on amending the charter of the ABC, not changing its comprehensive nature but emphasising a couple of areas. For example, he thinks regional and youth affairs should be written specifically into the charter. Why does he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="299"> want to put youth affairs in? I think this is a recognition of the role Triple J has played for young people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have a very close look at any recommendations the government may wish to put up in legislation to change the charter, but let it be quite clear: we will never vote in favour of removing a comprehensive nature of the ABC as a broadcaster across Australia. We will be sympathetic to putting in specialised areas to make sure they are recognised for the diversity of our culture and of our country, but never at the expense of comprehensiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not support recommendations to destroy the in-house capacity of the ABC to make drama as they have so successfully done in the last couple of decades. We will not support the abolition of an external broadcaster. We will look sympathetically at the idea that it could be a new one&hyphen;line budget allocation, but one thing is clear: we will not support an external broadcaster being run by the foreign affairs department or any other government department. Whether the funding line is separate or not, it will have to be run by the ABC under contract so that the credibility of what is broadcast is seen as factual and independent and not the voice of government propaganda. Those are the issues that we lay down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hope the government has the guts to admit it was wrong in trying to trample on the ABC and accepts the overwhelming thrust of this report as we do. We look forward to the debate in the community and we look forward, I have to say, to keep rubbing into this minister's grubby face the fact that he tried to fix the ABC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a turn up for the books this really is. I must say, a sense of deja vu pervades this debate about the ABC. I remember being on my feet in this chamber only last November speaking to a motion moved by Senator Schacht. He was alleging draconian cuts to the ABC, and only three months previous to that again, opposition senators were debating yet another similar motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I spoke to Senator Schacht's motion in November, I spoke about this government's commitment to the future of public broadcasting in this country, specifically about the commitment to creating conditions for creative renewal in the ABC. What do we see today? We see&mdash;goodness me!&mdash;that now there is some approval of the process we have undertaken!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time I also spoke about the need for an independent review of the role and functions of the ABC. That need was met by the Mansfield review&mdash;the first such review in 15 years. I can recall at that stage addressing the Senate about the virtues of an independent review and how the Mansfield report would meet that very need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Senator Schacht's earlier motion we can see today a change&mdash;that is, the Mansfield report has actually been handed down, and what a different story we see. What a change of tune we have. What do we find? We find that not so very long ago, Senator Schacht noted and, indeed, welcomed&mdash;which was just a few minutes ago&mdash;many of Mr Mansfield's recommendations. Today's motion even goes so far as to say that Mr Mansfield's recommendations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Challenge of a better ABC</EMPHASIS> are a complete rejection of the government's ideological attacks on the ABC. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="300">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could this be the same Mansfield review that Senator Schacht told this very chamber had `terms of reference that almost predict the outcome of the review'? They were terms of reference that were `narrow' and `aimed at restricting the ABC from being a broad based national independent broadcaster'. Could this be the same review about which Senator Schacht moved the following motion on 22 August 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) notes that the recommendations of the review of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) undertaken by Mr Bob Mansfield, are a complete rejection of the Government's ideological attacks on the ABC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">&hyphen; that is a bit of a turnaround&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) welcomes Mr Mansfield's support of Triple J and Classic FM;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">draconian funding cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">alleged draconian funding cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which the Federal Government made to the ABC which led Mr Mansfield to recommend the transferral of program making, except in news and current affairs . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The assumption implicit in what Senator Schacht has said is that so&hyphen;called draconian cuts were the causal connection for this recommendation by Mr Mansfield. But that is not so. Senator Schacht's about&hyphen;face motion then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) that it is in Australia's national interest to have an external broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not recall the government ever having maintained anything else. Next, he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) calls on the Federal Government to make a separate funding allocation to provide a service similar to Radio Australia and Australia Television;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have heard the minister say in the Senate today that it is up to the ABC to do what it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> likes with its funding. We will secure the funding and, if it wants to have a service similar to Radio Australia or Australia Television, or to maintain it in some form, that is a matter for management. The motion of Senator Schacht then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) supports Mr Mansfield's recommendation that the legislative prohibition on advertising and sponsorship remain; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) welcomes Mr Mansfield's support of regionalisation, with his recognition that radio and television in smaller States and regional areas are critical to community well&hyphen;being.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It seems that Senator Schacht has almost run out of superlatives to endorse Mr Mansfield's report. What a change from the motion put forward to the Senate in August condemning the Mansfield review and its terms and predicting dire outcomes for the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might ask: could it be the same Mansfield review that Senator Schacht told this very chamber had terms of reference that almost predicted the outcome of the review? If it did, certainly Senator Schacht did not seem to know what the outcome would be. He said they were terms of reference that were narrow and aimed at restricting the ABC from being a broad&hyphen;based national independent broadcaster. It appears that Senator Schacht was not too good at predicting the outcome of the Mansfield review and the government's role in appointing Mr Mansfield to conduct an independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cynicism about the Mansfield review, which I am suggesting to the Senate cannot be borne out under any circumstances, really is the old chestnut of never holding an inquiry for which you do not already know the outcome. That is not something that this government is party to. Senator Schacht was wrong in being cynical about the Mansfield review, and about the very motion that we are debating today, because he has noted, welcomed, endorsed and seeks support for the recommendations of the Mansfield review. That he is doing that attests to the fact that it was an independent report. The submissions for the Mansfield review involve very, very few Liberal Party supporters&mdash;absolutely no branch stacked supporters, no parliamentarians apart from the odd one here or there. This suggests, of course, exactly what it is. It is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="301"> independent report. It is not one where the outcome was in any way predicated. That is not the way the government has operated with respect to the independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield has reaffirmed that `our ABC' should remain free of advertising and sponsorship and that it should continue to provide programming across the content spectrum. The review also reaffirmed the important role of ABC radio's Triple J and Classic FM networks. So whatever criticism anyone in the government had about Triple J, it certainly did not affect Mr Mansfield's view, and it certainly has not affected his recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review has recognised the crucial role that the</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ABC plays in providing information and entertainment to Australians in isolated and regional areas. Now these are important matters. They are important matters that needed to be reviewed and, having been reviewed, the recommendations are there for all to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield review did, as asked in the terms of reference&mdash;it is only fair to mention this&mdash;take account of the government's broader fiscal strategy. Indeed, recommendations in the report reflect the necessity for some belt tightening within the ABC. That is not much of a surprise, having regard to some of the matters that have been referred to in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Schacht, however, has obviously discovered, the Mansfield review was not some kind of veiled attempt to destroy the ABC, whatever fiscal constraints and budgetary cuts were necessary. It certainly was not a razor gang. It was, as the government has been saying all along, an attempt to produce a wide&hyphen;ranging and forward looking blueprint to meet the challenge of a better ABC. And wasn't it a good idea, as it turns out, that the government had the foresight to appoint Mr Mansfield to conduct this review?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In announcing the Mansfield review of the ABC in July last year, the government indicated that it sought a redefined role for the ABC&mdash;one which strengthens its effectiveness in key areas by better articulating the scope 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of services and activities. In an article written in the wake of the ABC's own `One ABC' initiative, the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Brian Johns, described the new structure in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new structure gives practical form to the operating principles that will enable the ABC to secure its place in Australian society&mdash;the primacy of quality Australian content, acknowledgment of diverse audience needs, the opportunities opened up by digital technology and efficient management of assets and other resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One can say it is clear that even Aunty recognises the need to take a fresh look at herself, and that is exactly what the government was proposing with the Mansfield review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made of the Mansfield review's recommendation that program production be outsourced and, in today's motion, Senator Schacht attributes that decision purely to draconian budget cuts&mdash;nothing else at all. He does not in any way refer to the reference in the Mansfield report to the fact that there will be huge savings not only in capital and infrastructure but also from buildings that are not entirely utilised, buildings that have to be upgraded and real estate that will not be necessary if some outsourcing takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much to be said for the positioning of the ABC in the mould of commissioner&hyphen;broadcaster other than possible budgetary savings. Of course, we could not expect Senator Schacht to actually mention any, but I am going to do that. Few have put the case better than Michael Gordon Smith, who is the executive producer of the Screen Producers Association of Australia, in his opinion piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 4 February:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC will provide the best and widest range of programs if there is a contest open to anyone with ideas and skills. That means using the independent sector and outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some of the ABC's most successful programs are already contributed to by the freelance sector, and I will mention just a few. We have heard Senator Schacht refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brides of Christ</EMPHASIS>  that he has seen three times and I do not know how many times he has seen <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Dismissal</EMPHASIS>  but, presumably, he now knows what that is all about. In any event, other programs include: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">GP</EMPHASIS> , <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Joh's Jury</EMPHASIS> , <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="302"> Murder</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seven Deadly Sins</EMPHASIS> &mdash;these are examples of programs that have been made with the contribution of the freelance sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> is a particularly pertinent example of an independent product. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> was mentioned by Senator Schacht and it is something that we have probably all enjoyed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline </EMPHASIS>is a program that seems to get to the very heart of what goes on in news and current affairs programs. It is an award winning program which has been successfully on&hyphen;sold to overseas markets. Incidentally, the original pilot for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> was initially rejected by the ABC. If, indeed, there had been some contribution by the private sector, who is to say it would not have been there for all of us to enjoy much earlier in the piece than we have seen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its own submission to the Mansfield review, the ABC identifies the option of commissioner&hyphen;broadcaster role for itself as one of the alternatives to be considered within the process of restructure. Admittedly, the submission does not address itself to the possibility of outsourcing with the degree of enthusiasm that they might now do. But our national broadcaster indicated a willingness to consider the possibilities&mdash;as well it might, because it needs to be flexible; it needs to be able to respond to the sorts of imperatives that it has to face not only in terms of budget but also in terms of the new technology it has to buy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The options are well worth considering. If one draws an analogy with the role that Triple J plays in fostering Australian music, we begin to see how ABC television may have a role to play in fostering Australian drama. Triple J sees an important part of its role, no doubt, as highlighting new, innovative and adventurous music. I certainly enjoy listening to it. I know that Triple J has now adopted as one of its promos Senator Hill's answer that he was listening to Triple J one morning. It is fostering particularly Australian music in an environment which is not constrained by commercial pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the benefits of this approach is the fostering of independent Australian bands recording on independent Australian labels, labels which are small to medium Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> businesses. Similar exposure is given from time to time from artists who have produced self-funded recordings. Why cannot this be used as a model for drama on the ABC? What tremendous possibilities and opportunities could be opened up by similar fostering of independent television production; what exciting and diverse discoveries might there be ahead of us. Greater use of the independent production sector can only benefit the ABC's audience. Most ABC listeners, I would think, do not care very much about who made a program; they care about the content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example has been given that having completely in-house production of drama and non-news productions in the ABC is a bit like Triple J having its own band and its own singers&mdash;it is an absolute nonsense. The ABC has to go out and employ actors. It has to employ a lot of creative talent; it does not have it all on staff; and it is absolute nonsense to suggest that economies and efficiencies cannot be made by outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has been loath to make a comparison between a commissioner/broadcaster role for itself and the role played by the magnificent Channel Four in the United Kingdom. The ABC points to the fact that Channel Four operates in a larger industry and has `no internal production culture to retain and protect.' These are givens at the current time, but surely they do not preclude us from aiming for the kind of exciting, diverse and, at times, fearless&mdash;and I emphasise the word `fearless'&mdash;programming for which Channel Four is known throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What precludes the ABC from doing this? External bodies already contribute in the vicinity of 28 per cent of non&hyphen;news and current affairs programming. The ABC already outsources all its writing requirements, and frequently enters into co&hyphen;production agreements to gain access to the skills of creative producers. There is nothing to fear from the ABC undertaking a program of significantly outsourcing its non&hyphen;news product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendations to close Radio Australia, if that occurs, will no doubt be of concern to many people. But, as Senator Alston said today in the chamber, with half a billion 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="303"> dollars given to the ABC and a total cost of $20.5 million this year to run Radio Australia, it is up to management to make decisions about the importance of Radio Australia and ATV and about the place of Radio Australia in the future of the ABC&mdash;what role it serves, whether or not it should be retained and if so, in what form. It is not a government decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On current information it is almost impossible to find any evidence to really be able to evaluate how effective Radio Australia and ATV might be, or to come to conclusions about how effectively they further Australia's trade and diplomatic objectives in the region. It is very difficult to know, for instance, what role Radio Australia and ATV played in allaying fears expressed in some countries in the South&hyphen;East Asian region about the scurrilous Hanson debate. It would be very interesting to know to what extent Radio Australia and ATV might have had a role in that. It is impossible to gauge without further information. It is up to the ABC to decide on the place of Radio Australia and ATV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has welcomed the Mansfield report. It is edifying to see that so many of its recommendations are embraced wholeheartedly by those on the other side, who accept and welcome it. Concerns about outsourcing and about Radio Australia and ATV will no doubt become as hollow as Senator Schacht's motion last August, which was terribly concerned about the terms of the Mansfield inquiry and predicted dire things for the outcome of that report. On any view, Bob Mansfield has provided a blueprint for a future ABC. The government will not be ignoring its responsibilities to ensure that the ABC is given a clear and sustainable role for the future. I said this in, I think, November and I am saying it again today. There is nothing to suggest that this is not a commitment we will honour.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The notice of motion given yesterday by Senator Schacht calls on the Senate to note `that the recommendations made in the report of the Mansfield review are a complete rejection of the government's ideological attacks on the ABC'. I have to say that the term `complete rejection' there is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trifle generous on Senator Schacht's part. The Democrats believe that certain sections of this report do make recommendations that accord with the government's ideological attacks on the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the report redrafts the charter of the ABC to reflect a dramatically reduced role in the functions and services of the ABC. The revised charter removes key terms such as `innovation' and `comprehensive'&mdash;both absolutely key terms. It takes away the requirement for the ABC to deliver educational material and musical, drama and other performing arts programs. So culture and the performing arts seem to go out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It removes the orchestras from the parameters of the ABC. It also removes the terms `high standard', `national identity'&mdash;both of those would go&mdash;and `international broadcasting', which has been the subject of heated debate over the last couple of days, as we have heard. It removes the requirement for the ABC to deliver programs adding to the cultural enrichment of our society, and it removes the requirement to broadcast specialised programs. In the proposed charter, independence relates only to news and current affairs programs broadcast on the ABC and to no other programming. It is a much diminished charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that the leaked cabinet submission&mdash;which Senator Alston now says is not his own and he did not sign off on, but which was certainly there before the Mansfield review started&mdash;proposed a new charter for the ABC. That charter in that leaked cabinet submission is exactly the same as the one proposed in the Mansfield report. I do not think that is a coincidence. Surely that cannot be described as anything other than delivering the government's ideological agenda, at least as far as the charter is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the call for the ABC to have the majority of its programs outsourced to the private sector? I do not think that Senator Coonan, when she spoke about it, really understood the difference between outsourcing and co&hyphen;production. The effect of outsourcing on the ABC would be well and truly negative. The recommendation for majority outsourcing is made at a time when many other broadcast 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="304"> ers, including commercial broadcasters, are moving in the opposite direction, to shore up their production capabilities and rights in a marketplace which is increasingly cross selling its product onto other free to air networks, to pay TV and to other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you want those rights in order to make a substantial profit out of this, and you cannot have those rights taken away from you. Money to the ABC is diminishing all the time, and they have to find other sources from which to get it. One of those sources is to have the rights to co&hyphen;productions and to their own productions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recommendation does not take into consideration the need for, or the importance of, the national broadcaster engaging in the selling of its productions to other markets. It does not take into consideration the fact that the majority of the ABC budget and its staff is directed to production activity. It is downsizing&mdash;another dreadful word&mdash;in its most blatant form.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WEST" NAMEID="1X4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sacking&mdash;thank you, Senator West. It also does not take into consideration the experimental nature of program innovation and of production, which have been immensely successful. It is no accident that the ABC is the broadcaster that continues to win industry awards for the material it produces. Senator Coonan also told us that the original pilot for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS>  was rejected by the ABC. I did not notice that it was picked up by anybody else. None of the commercial broadcasters appear to be showing it now. I watch it all the time, and it is on the ABC. So the ABC eventually picked it up&mdash;nobody else did. I think that tells us something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget that Mr Mansfield admits he has found no reliable costings&mdash;none&mdash;to demonstrate where the ABC in&hyphen;house productions are higher than those produced by independent production houses. That is no sound basis for such a strong recommendation, particularly for one which the government finds so gleefully nice. It also amounts to promoting the private sector with government money. I should not say government money: promoting the private sector with our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money, with my money, with your money, with every senator's money and every Australian's money. This is not the government's money; this is my money as much as theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would the taxpaying public actually appreciate their money being used to prop up the private sector? I do not. It looks to me as though this recommendation does deliver the government's ideological perspective for the ABC. In relation to funding, the report makes no recommendations&mdash;and, yes, I know about all the terms of reference&mdash;to reverse the proposed government funding cuts. Indeed, it states that about $500 million is enough to operate a national broadcaster. It does not say why, how or where that figure comes from. I know exactly where that figure comes from. It merely states it as a figure. That figure was picked out of the air by the government and now has become a fait accompli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report makes no recommendations about how additional regional services could be funded without axing other key programs, although it acknowledges that those services are extremely expensive. On the basis of Mr Mansfield's report, the ABC will be an even poorer cousin to the private sector than it already is. The ABC has suffered a real cut in funding of 30 per cent over the same period that commercial broadcasters have increased their revenue by 30 per cent. The report is extremely light on detail about how the $55 million could be saved. This does deliver the government's agenda on the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also makes recommendations to divest Radio Australia and Australia Television. Radio Australia is unique in a number of aspects: it is Australian, it is commercial free, it is broadcast in languages of our region, it has a vital role in communications and in cultural education, and it promotes information flow to areas where local media is very restricted. That includes places where it is very difficult to receive anything other than short&hyphen;wave radio, such as Papua New Guinea, and it also includes totalitarian and military regimes such as Burma. This is very important and is not considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Jose Ramos Horta, the Nobel Peace laureate, was speaking yesterday, he was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="305"> talking about how Radio Australia is so terribly important to the people of East Timor who do not get ordinary old news the way we expect it; they get news that is extremely censored and is exactly what the regime in Jakarta wants them to hear, unless they are listening to Radio Australia, in which case they hear an independent news broadcast. That is another reason why it would be a terrible shame for Radio Australia to be run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and not by an independent broadcaster. Its independence is very important to it in the region, it is very important to its culture and is valued enormously by people who cannot be counted by any independent census of listens. Who knows who listens? The point is: who can listen? This is an extremely small amount of money for the good that it does in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the promises of Better Broadcasting&mdash;a wonderful piece of paper which does not mean very much at all&mdash;which are in accordance with the governments economic ideology, axing Radio Australia and selling Australia Television is simply a cost&hyphen;cutting, mealy&hyphen;mouthed attempt to save a tiny amount. In terms of the budget, this is an absolutely tiny amount of government expenditure. There are some other pieces of the motion which was introduced by Senator Schacht that I really should mention.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Federal Government to make a separate funding allocation to provide a service similar to Radio Australia and Australia Television.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know why it should be similar. I think they are quite good as they are, particularly Radio Australia. I should mention there also that Senator Coonan said she wondered what sort of a part Radio Australia had played in the debate regarding the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her views on race in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just been to Hong Kong with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Human Rights Subcommittee. We are looking at the transfer of sovereignty to China and, I must say, under the new austerity, we paid for ourselves. We had a very good program. I must say I was shocked by the number of people who raised the words and the views of the member for Oxley with me and when I asked where they had obtained that information from, it was not from Radio Australia; it had come from their local radio and television stations. Most of the people I spoke to gave it as their opinion that the local press particularly quite enjoyed writing quirky stories about Australia. The view in general was that they thought this was just typical and that we had never really got over the White Australia Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I do not believe that is the view of the vast majority of Australians. Just because a majority of people in one seat voted one person into the federal parliament&mdash;who did have `Liberal' after her name 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="306"> after all&mdash;when they did not really know her views at the time, I do not believe that a majority of Australians feel that way. I think it is a great shame that local press in particular around the region in South-East Asia have chosen to run those stories when it is not in anybody's best interests that they do. I do not think it is fair on the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I can assure Senator Coonan that, from what I heard&mdash;I did ask everyone who asked me about this, and there were a lot of people who asked me about it in Hong Kong&mdash;none of the reports which sensationalised those words came from Radio Australia. In fact, Radio Australia played a really straight bat on it. Radio Australia was reporting exactly what was going on here. That is, therefore, absolutely not any sort of a reason to get rid of Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (e) of Senator Schacht's motion says that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">supports Mr Mansfield's recommendation that the legislative prohibition on advertising and sponsorship remain;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Absolutely. The Democrats have always agreed with that. We did not vote for advertising or sponsorship on Australia Television. We just do not like having advertising or sponsorship on the national broadcaster. We will not vote for it at this time or at any other time. It is just not an option as far as we are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (f) of Senator Schacht's motion says that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">welcomes Mr Mansfield's support of regionalisation, with his recognition that radio and television in smaller States and regional areas are critical to community well-being.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly right. We would agree with that. We think it is tragic the way that the current cost cutting has meant that some regions have far less local content. It is an absolute tragedy that that is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that really has to be reversed. There are two ways that that can be reversed. You can cut down on other key programs and you can put the money into the regions. That is not a good option. It is not encouraging the ABC to grow or to be more innovative or to be more comprehensive. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact, it is encouraging it to be far less. I wonder if that is in fact the government's agenda. The second option is to give them more funding. You can reverse that funding cut. You can put it back to where at least 86 per cent of Australians, according to the last poll, want it to be and you can make sure that the regionalisation of the ABC continues and is not going backwards the way it is at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, there are areas in the Mansfield report which the Democrats agree with and for which we are grateful. I think Mr Mansfield is an honourable man and he has done as good a job as he could in the time he was given, but I just do not agree with some of his amendments. In fact, I think that probably his recommended charter was something that was put before him by somebody from the department, with which he probably agreed, but I do not think he wrote it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think he wrote those words. If he did, it is just an extraordinary coincidence that they accord absolutely word for word with the suggested charter in Senator Alston's&mdash;if not Senator Alston's then his department's, because he is denying knowledge of it now&mdash;cabinet submission which came before the recommendations of the Mansfield inquiry. I think that that is a particularly interesting point which we should never lose sight of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great pity that Mr Mansfield has delivered so much of what the government wanted when it actually commissioned this review. On the positive side, Mr Mansfield's findings with which we concur include the retention of the status quo on domestic advertising and sponsorship and the retention of existing domestic networks. That is a terribly important point and one on which I think he should be congratulated for putting down, because I do not think that is part of the government's agenda. I think they wanted to get rid of a couple. We also concur with the independence of news, current affairs and basic information programs&mdash;that is absolutely basic and very important. In fact, I believe that the government acceded to that before the report came down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another finding with which we concur is triennial funding. That is an interesting one; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="307"> we will have to see what the government wants to do about that. We concur with current cash flow difficulties being taken into account, another interesting one. It will be fascinating to see what the government does about that. We also concur with the importance of the ABC as an outlet for Australian creativity, so I am glad he has used the word `creativity' somewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are key areas of that report with which we have great difficulty. Most of these stem from Mr Mansfield's acceptance of the government's vicious funding cuts for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year and onwards and his acceptance that the national broadcaster can operate on a budget of $500 million per annum. It has not operated on so small a budget for a long time. It is a very large broadcaster. It has a national television network. It has several national radio networks. It runs many more things than Channel 9. Do not compare it with Channel 9. Do not compare it with Channel 10. Do not compare it with any radio network. It is an amalgam of all of those things and it does everything that they do, only better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to the outsourcing of the majority of non&hyphen;news and current affairs television productions. It has not been convincingly demonstrated that this would lead to a genuine reduction in costs to the ABC or to programs equal in quality to those currently produced in&hyphen;house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relative size of the Australian broadcasting marketplace invalidates any comparisons with the UK or the US. As far as the sale of real estate assets is concerned, this looks a lot like short&hyphen;term expedience with the serious risk of creating long-term cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats see no problem with the report's emphasis on the importance of services to regional Australia. Despite the technological revolution, regional and rural Australians are still plagued by the tyranny of distance and will be for a long time yet to come. Those difficulties cannot be underestimated, but the ABC should not be expected to provide programs to those regions at the expense of other Australians&mdash;at the expense of urban Australia. You cannot forget that the vast majority of Australians live in the capital 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cities and they should be able to see the ABC to the same extent as regional Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC should be adequately funded to broadcast the same high quality, comprehensive, innovative product to every single Australian. With the possible exception of news and current affairs programs, the implementation of all of those recommendations would leave the ABC exposed to having to provide the leftovers of broadcasting&mdash;programs that commercial stations reject as too boring or too expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield recommended many changes to the charter. They can only be concurred with by parliamentary approval. We will give careful consideration to them. I heard Senator Schacht say that the Labor Party would give careful consideration to them. We really ought to note that we should all be extremely wary of any changes that weaken the charter. The Democrats will certainly not be voting for any changes that weaken the charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the obligation for international broadcasting almost certainly comes under that category, especially with regard to Radio Australia. I cannot understand how anybody could maintain that Radio Australia is not one of the best and most important parts of our foreign policy. It is difficult to accept that times are so tough in Australia that we cannot afford to pay the ABC to produce Radio Australia. They are so tough that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, yesterday offered to help us pay for Radio Australia because it is so important, as he said, to every Papua New Guinean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that times are so tough in this country that we would damage our international reputation, standing and influence in our region to such an extent just to, firstly, save a minuscule amount of money in the budget and, secondly, punish the ABC. I find it extraordinary that anybody could even consider such a thing. It reminds me extraordinarily of the DIFF scheme, although I hate to say such a thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a lot of these recommendations in the Mansfield report are implemented, they will prevent the ABC from functioning effectively or efficiently. They will lead to the continued 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="308"> shedding of staff and programs for all audiences. This is a disaster for every audience in Australia. This government's obsessive determination to punish the ABC hangs like a death shadow over every one of its actions on the ABC. You cannot help wondering why they have done this. Every time the ABC is mentioned, you cannot help wondering why this is happening and what the real reason behind this is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaked cabinet submission on the ABC vividly showed the difficulties that faced Bob Mansfield when he undertook this review. I have never doubted Mr Mansfield's integrity and I do not doubt it now. But I do not doubt how history will judge this report. I believe that it will be judged as a tool in the coalition's orchestrated campaign to strangle the ABC and ultimately force the ABC into irrelevance whereby it can be gotten rid of. That is the stupidest move&mdash;I said it yesterday and I will say it again&mdash;that this coalition government has made. It will be seen at the next election to be the stupidest move this coalition government has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will vote based on this. The government has no idea how many letters and phone calls I get on this. The government probably does have an idea, because Senator Alston probably gets more than I do. If that is the case, he is getting thousands of letters on this. I do not think he is asking Mr Johns to personally reply to every one of them&mdash;I doubt it very much&mdash;but he is getting those letters. He must realise that this is a big mistake on the government's part. Sooner or later, they will pay for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the chamber as moved by Senator Schacht reflects the opposition's consistent stance in support of the ABC and its recognition of its importance to Australia in providing a broad range of services to the Australian people. Labor has a clear commitment to a comprehensive, independent and properly funded ABC. That sentiment was strongly reflected in the submissions by 10,616 persons which were received by Mr Mansfield in his review of the ABC. I can think of very few other Australian institutions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that would evoke such strong public support and reaction amongst ordinary Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the recommendations made by Mr Mansfield are commendable; the opposition acknowledges that. We welcome particularly the support of the highly successful Triple J service and Classic FM. They are networks which were only recently introduced. They represent part of an expanded role for the ABC as it met more fully its charter under the previous management of David Hill. The ABC today is a much stronger organisation than it was even 12 years ago. It is the strength of that organisation that this government fears. It is the commitment by the Australian people to that organisation that this government fears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased with the way in which Mr Mansfield advocated the retention of the legislative prohibition on advertising and sponsorship for the ABC. This prohibition is a central point in the ABC's present charter. Labor has strongly supported that position for many years. Unfortunately, Mr Mansfield had very restrictive terms of reference. He was forced to respond to the government's predetermined program in terms of its budgetary bottom line. It is in that context that Labor opposes a number of the recommendations which Mr Mansfield has brought forward. We believe that a number of the recommendations in Mr Mansfield's report, if implemented, would weaken the ABC and narrow the focus of its services and capacity to serve Australians. It would, particularly if its services in the international arena were reduced, weaken Australia's reputation within the broader international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been quite clearly a very difficult task for Mr Mansfield. He has undertaken it with some skill; we have to acknowledge that. He has been forced to conduct a review in the context of quite a determined government campaign. This government has launched a cynical, predetermined, premeditated campaign; its cabinet documents quite clearly reveal that. On the other hand, this government has a minister in charge of this area who, in many respects, is able to pursue an agenda which he is firmly committed to, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="309"> despite in earlier days his commitment to broad liberal philosophies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agenda is essentially geared to the function of reducing the capacity of the ABC to meet its charter and commitment to the Australian people as a comprehensive, independent broadcaster. That is really at the heart of the government's campaign to reduce its budget by $55 million annually. The impact of that will be to reduce its capacity to service the Australian people and meet the demands of the Australian people for a comprehensive broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's problems are quite immense in terms of trying to implement this agenda. How can they provide for a budget reduction of some $55 million for an institution which is so widely respected within the community at large and so strongly supported internationally? How can they do this when they have employees who command great respect and admiration amongst Australian people at large? How can the government do this when in opposition they made so many statements in support of a policy which is quite clearly contrary to the one they are pursuing in government.

What they found was that the basic structure of the ABC was sound, the organisation was considerably stronger and more relevant to the Australian community than it had been 10 years earlier 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it was strongly placed to meet the challenges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall only too well the debates that took place in that committee. The committee supported the maintenance of current funding levels in real terms and supported favourable consideration of any application for the provision of additional funding to ensure the viability of new joint parliamentary and ABC approved charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister sought to woo the arts community and the general public during the election campaign with a policy which he quite clearly never intended to carry out once in government. It strikes me that it takes considerable political skill to engineer a backflip of that dimension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's response has been quite clear. First of all he has been able to get his colleagues to attack its credibility in the public mind. We have seen numerous attacks upon the ABC in terms of its alleged political correctness and its incapacity to meet the demands of the Australian people. We have seen attempts to silence internal dissent within the ABC&mdash;particularly in relation to changes to the board. We have seen a slashing of the budget which engenders a wide sense of fear, intimidation and disillusionment within the ABC, which directly saps the morale of the organisation and the capacity of the organisation to defend its legitimate role within Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government set up a review which is supposed to provide the straight track on which the budget bottom lines are delivered and on which the conservative political agenda, which has been well documented throughout the 1990s, will be delivered. What happened? The review came down with findings which quite clearly do not meet the needs of this government. When the real problems emerge we see that this government blames other people. That is par for the course for this government, and this minister in particular. He finds it necessary to blame other ministers, blame his office and blame other persons for the government's failure to keep this agenda secret. What we have found is that when he is finally caught out he says 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="310"> that he is just the loyal soldier doing what he has been told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What strikes me is the extraordinary capacity of this government to evade, to engage in double speak and to be deceitful in the way in which it camouflages its strategy. The actions of this government are crystal clear. Most of the industry understands that the government's strategy revolves around attacks on the integrity of the ABC. In recent times, we have seen the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Mr Kennett and other senior Liberals make comments which seek to denigrate the ABC and undermine public confidence in the ABC&mdash;one of the great Australian institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June last year the Prime Minister entered the fray with his unsupported accusations that there had been political correctness in the ABC to a fault. There had been allegations that the ABC concentrated on one political point of view. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am sure many on this side of the chamber would be quick to say that the ABC has, on many occasions, offended the Labor Party in the way it has presented issues. I will not say that that has always been justified, but this claim that the Labor Party gets special treatment from the ABC is totally incorrect. In my judgment, the ABC has maintained its independence in its coverage of politics in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that in March 1996 Mr Kennett was somewhat less than subtle, as he often is, when he described the ABC as a great leech on society. He stated that if he had his way he would close it down. He said that he felt it was a view shared by many of his federal colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the cabinet submission the government undertook a program to get the ABC board to accept its agenda. We know that that is quite contrary to the legislative framework within which the ABC is supposed to operate. The government, through their cabinet submission and cabinet processes, set out to get the ABC to acquiesce to this campaign of denigration. They sought to ensure that a review would produce results that they thought would be compatible with their political interests. The whole problem is that Mr Mansfield has not delivered the report that they were seeking. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Mansfield review was designed to justify the savage expenditure cuts and to politically nobble the ABC in a manner which would suit the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mansfield's review has not done that. Mansfield has quite rightly, I think, acted with integrity and produced a report which, of course, does not justify the cuts that are being made to the ABC. He rejected the criticisms of bias and supports past actions of the ABC. He rejected attempts to significantly narrow the focus of the ABC. He supported the ABC's role as a comprehensive provider&mdash;and I think that is a fundamental issue in terms of the question of public discussion about the role of the ABC. He sought to broaden the philosophical outlook, in terms of the ABC, within his report, and he quite clearly reflected the widespread community support that the ABC enjoys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, what has occurred with Mansfield's report is that there has been a substantial rejection of the government's ideological attacks upon the ABC. In that context I am quite certain the minister has not welcomed Mansfield's report. He has not welcomed it. He is obliged, of course, to say encouraging things about Mansfield, but quite frankly, within the context of the political agenda set down by Senator Alston, Mansfield has not fulfilled his expectations. Of course, it is in this regard that Mr Mansfield is to be commended. It is unfortunate that he has had to respond, and felt it necessary to respond, to the government's review in terms of the budgetary allocation for the ABC: a budgetary reduction which we believe is nothing short of vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we strongly disagree with Mr Mansfield's contentions in regard to recommendations which would have a severe impact on the capacity of the ABC to function as a comprehensive broadcaster. Mr Mansfield's recommendations, when combined with the government's budget cuts, do produce a picture which would see the ABC stripped of many of its staff, many of its creative assets and many of its strongest performers, in terms of providing that comprehensive broadcasting service. The result of the budget cuts will see the reduction of some 300 jobs, which will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="311"> affect all aspects of the ABC's operations, but, of course, would substantially reduce the effectiveness of the ABC when you look at the impact of those job losses on programming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, is going to be the case, particularly, on metropolitan radio. We see another 600 jobs are scheduled to go as a result of the budget targets, which will have a severe effect on radio networks and Australian content on ABC television. On top of this, I think some of Mr Mansfield's recommendations, if implemented by this government, would see a further reduction of 1,300 to 1,400 jobs. Two hundred of these jobs would be lost by a push to contract out ABC support services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield's recommendation that a majority of the non&hyphen;news and TV production be contracted out could result in as many as 1,000 jobs being lost within the ABC. In my home city of Melbourne that would have a dramatic impact on the creative community and, of course, would have a dramatic impact on the capacity of the ABC to produce distinctly Australian programs, such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Janus</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix</EMPHASIS> and the other great productions that have come out of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to radio, I fail to see how contracting out of production could not result in a major deterioration of programming. The experience of the BBC, which has been driven by its government to undertake a similar ideologically determined position, has seen, quite simply, a reduction in the quality of service of the BBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look further at the job losses, we see that another 170 jobs will be lost if this government proceeds with its recommendation to abolish its international broadcasting services and to scrap what I regard as the very important services provided by Radio Australia. Of course, I do not have to remind the Senate, I am sure, of the impact that that would have on Melbourne, especially given that the Melbourne complex at Southgate has a very significant component providing services for Radio Australia. This was the very point that this minister made in opposition about the ABC and these were the concerns he expressed at the time about the loss 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of services for the ABC in Melbourne. Once again, we see the hypocrisy come shining through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield was forced, in his judgment, to choose between international and domestic broadcasting, at the behest of this Liberal government's agenda. That is essentially the framework in which he had to operate, as he saw it. Radio Australia is clearly viewed by the government as a major sacrificial lamb to be slaughtered in its determination to extract funds from the ABC. It would save some $20 million if it was ever implemented and, of course, it would provide some movement towards the achievement of the $77 million of savings targeted for over the two&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, once again, this is a position that stands in very sharp contrast to the pre&hyphen;election commitments this government made when it was in opposition. On Radio Australia, coalition policy was quite emphatic and many Australians could be forgiven for believing that this government actually meant what it said when it was in opposition. Hopefully, by now, they would understand that that was a mistaken view. Hopefully, they understand, by now, that this government is quite clearly made up of politicians who are prepared to say and do anything to secure power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Liberal opposition at the time stated bluntly&mdash;quite bluntly&mdash;that Radio Australia `has a proud place in the ABC'; it recognised that Radio Australia has served the expatriate community and other nationals in our region for half a century and that Radio Australia's existing services would not be prejudiced or downgraded in any way. That is what the Liberal Party said in opposition. That is quite clearly not what the minister is saying now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's downgrading of the value of Radio Australia is quite clearly in sharp contrast to the commitments that he made to the Australian people prior to the election. I think it is quite extraordinary for him to say in this Senate, as he said yesterday, that because short wave transmission, as a technology, is declining, there is&mdash;somehow or another&mdash;a justification for the removal of Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is quite clear&mdash;I am sure he would be only too well aware of this&mdash;is that there is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="312"> a strong movement within Radio Australia to move to satellite and on&hyphen;line technology. It is no longer simply confined to short&hyphen;wave technology. He would equally be aware of actions within the BBC to commit to short&hyphen;wave radio for the next 20 years. As a technology it is still very useful. But to say that the ABC is stuck in the past, as he is trying to suggest, is quite clearly a cynical misrepresentation of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former chairman of the board said yesterday in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, to suggest that because short&hyphen;wave radio is declining as a technology that is a justification for the closure of Radio Australia is like suggesting that because telegraph is an obsolete technology within postal services that should in itself be a justification for closing down Australia Post. Quite clearly that is a ridiculous proposition. But that is essentially what is being argued here. Because there are changes in technology, we close down the organisation; whereas instead we should be looking at ways and means by which the service can be provided on a more effective basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It matters little to this government that Australians will ultimately suffer as a result of such a policy, because Australia will become less influential amongst its regional neighbours. Australian culture and Australia's capacity to be able to project an independent democratic view in this region will be lessened. It is extraordinary that, when we spend so much time trying to present Australia to the international community in a positive way, the very service which is so respected should be closed down as result of a budget measure. That is extraordinarily short-sighted as far as I am concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate over Radio Australia emerges at a time when our regional neighbours are increasingly questioning this government's long-term commitment to the region. Given some of the domestic developments on issues concerning our relationship with Asia, this could not come at a worse time. It would appear that it matters very little to this minister that the axing of Radio Australia is in quite sharp contrast to the position put by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> To suggest that somehow or another it can be taken over as some sort of public relations arm of DFAT is quite clearly an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people. It is counterproductive in terms of the presentation of this country in a positive manner within the region. It plays into the hands of those like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has a view of Asia which strikes me as being terribly counterproductive to the interests of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are quite serious implications from this debate, not just in immediate terms on the basis of this government's integrity and its capacity to say what it means and to operate on the basis of some political morality, but also in terms of the future cultural development of this country. The ABC plays a vital role in ensuring the development of Australia's cultural integrity within this region. In a domestic sense it plays a role in ensuring the capacity of all Australians to have their views, their aspirations and their values reflected in a credible way through a public broadcaster like the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed an extraordinary irony that the government of Papua New Guinea can offer $1 million to provide such a service to this country. How extraordinarily paltry an attitude it must be from this government to find itself being offered advice from New Guinea on such matters as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for the Labor Party that the ABC is properly defended by this parliament. We have an obligation as a parliament to ensure that the comprehensive independent nature of the ABC is protected from a predatory government which is committed to the destruction of this organisation and whose assurances made prior to the election cannot be believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are committed to the destruction of the ABC for quite base ideological reasons. The comments that they have made to the contrary are absolutely legendary. It does show the cynicism with which this government approaches government and, more especially, the cynicism with which this government approaches the Australian people. They have enormous political difficulty in persuading the Australian people that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="313"> ABC is not worthy of support, so they have set upon a program to try to persuade them of that, but they are failing miserably. The Mansfield report demonstrates just how miserably they are failing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, Mr Mansfield is to be commended. The ideologically determined attacks on the ABC by the Tories in this country&mdash;the philistinism of this government&mdash;is not being supported by the community at large. The Australian people deeply value the ABC. The Australian Labor Party fully supports the ABC in its capacity to operate as a comprehensive independent service provider to the Australian people. In that regard we welcome Mr Mansfield's acknowledgment of the commitment from the Australian people to the ABC. We reject wholeheartedly this government's determination to undermine and white&hyphen;ant that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the Senate is appropriate. It acknowledges that the draconian funding cuts by this government cannot possibly be supported by the Australian people. The government's cynical attempts to attack the ABC will be rejected by the Australian people. We acknowledge that it is in the international interest of this country to ensure that there are external services and to ensure that the comprehensive nature of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's charter is widened and deepened, not narrowed and undermined. In that capacity we call upon the federal government to make separate funding allocations if necessary to provide for Radio Australia and Australia Television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, many of Mr Mansfield's recommendations should be supported because of their refusal to accept the legislative prohibition on advertising and sponsorship that have been so strongly challenged by elements of the extreme right within the Liberal Party itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we welcome Mr Mansfield's support of regionalisation with its recognition that radio and television in smaller states and regional areas are critical to community wellbeing. These are all sentiments that this government acknowledged the importance of in opposition. We call upon them now in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government to put their money where their mouth is, to acknowledge the commitments they made and to fulfil those commitments to the Australian people. We call upon all senators to support such a worthy proposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also in support of the motion moved by Senator Schacht, recognising the valuable contribution and service that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation provides these days to the whole of Australia and to many overseas places: to expatriate Australians but also in the language services to people of non&hyphen;English speaking countries. The ABC provides them with a service of news and information about Australia and about world events that can be seen to be objective and analytical in its content. For some people it is the only alternative point of view that they are able to hear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we heard the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) say that there were a small number of letters from people in the People's Republic of China&mdash;or from China; he did not say whether it was the PRC or the Republic of China and Taiwan. But I would suggest to the minister that he should think carefully about the ability of people in some of those countries&mdash;not necessarily in China&mdash;to communicate with us in this country. Certainly, people in Burma listening to Radio Australia on the short wave are not going to be writing to anybody at the ABC or to anybody in Australia to say how good the ABC is. The last thing that they want is for SLORC to identify the fact that they are getting information and news from anywhere other than that tyrannical regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the minister to dismiss the number of responses and therefore the number of listeners as being insignificant is to show gross ignorance of what the conditions are in some of those countries, particularly Burma&mdash;I will single out Burma&mdash;where human rights do not exist, where protest can well be met with death, and writing to and listening to the ABC could be seen as protest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People say we do not know how many of these people there are. Sure, you do not know how many because there are people out there listening whose lives depend on the regimes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="314"> in the countries in which they live not knowing that they are listening. I think it behoves the minister to take that argument and that consequence into consideration when he is entering into this argument about the ABC and Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC is a very important service. For a number of people in this country, the ABC is the only radio service, the only television service, to which they have access. I am really pleased to see that Mr Mansfield recognises in his report the importance of rural and regional services provided by the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report he has quoted John Cobb of the National Farmers Federation saying why they in fact rely on ABC Radio more than their parents' generation did because there are fewer people working on farming properties in isolated and remoter areas of Australia. There are fewer people working there and there is less outside communication and interaction with people, so the radio becomes the source of their interaction with the outside world. We have certainly seen some changes in access with the use of portable radios, transistors and such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us who grew up in rural areas grew up&mdash;and people still grow up&mdash;knowing only ABC Radio. I certainly grew up in an area that is not all that remote and isolated but where, of an evening, the radio reception on anything other than the ABC was totally impossible. So we were forced to listen to the ABC. That is where you become totally dependent on that source of entertainment, music and information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thoroughly recommend the comments that John Cobb is quoted in the report as making. Following some of  Mr Cobb's comments that are recorded in the report, Mr Mansfield says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very strongly of the view that the ABC's Charter should establish a clear obligation for the ABC to maintain a regional presence and to broadcast programming with a regional focus. Unless this is done, the temptation will always exist for management to cut in these areas because it could provoke a less audible outcry than cuts in areas where the strength and volume of opposition may be greater. I believe this would be a genuine tragedy if it were allowed to occur. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could suggest to Mr Mansfield that the audibility of the outcry if rural and regional ABC Radio in particular were tampered with would be one that he would not need any amplification to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that that conclusion he has reached is a little bit inaccurate because I put to you that people in rural and regional Australia will complain a lot more loudly than people in the city areas about any tampering and any cuts to their ABC because, as I said earlier, for many of them that is the only source they have. So I want to see it in the charter&mdash;I think it is very important&mdash;but I say a word of warning to Mr Mansfield that I do not think that it is a totally correct assessment. There might not be the volume of people there but there is no choice of alternative media in the bush like there is in the city and there are therefore many more people listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some concerns though. At the bottom of page 24 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not propose to recommend minimum levels of regional programming. I believe that the ABC Board and management should have responsibility for determining the appropriate mix of services including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the balance between radio and television services;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a mix of local and networked programs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the level of specialised programming for regional audiences (such as rural programs and reports); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the extent to which regional studios contribute to national programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have concerns that he is not prepared to write into the charter anything other than that there should be a clear obligation to a regional presence. I am not sure what his definition of a regional presence is. Is a regional presence just putting a service emanating out of a capital city on to the translator and sending it across the network? Just how much here has to be answered? How much are they talking about local production, local content? These are important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, with the ABC regional service&mdash;on radio at least&mdash;in most parts of rural and regional Australia, we get locally produced programs and programs emanating out of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="315"> local station starting at 6 a.m. and going through to about 11 a.m. The rest of the time, from 11 a.m. on, it is networked. It might be produced for regional Australia&mdash;that is, non-metropolitan Australia or maybe non-Sydney and Melbourne Australia&mdash;but it is networked. You do get breaks for local news at 12.30 p.m. and at 1.30 p.m. with a weather bulletin but the rest of the time until about 6 o'clock at night, until <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> comes on, it is regionally networked. So it is emanating out of one or two studios across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 6 p.m., it is the same service that is heard in the capital cities and everywhere else. I am not saying that it is not a good service and program, but I want some clarification. I think it is very important that we are aware that when we are talking about localism and regional focuses we are talking not just about having a translator there and having access but also about the content that emanates from the rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some differences that I see when I look at couple of the recommendations. Recommendation No. 6 talks about rural and regional; recommendation No. 7 talks about the `provision of services for children as a programming priority'; recommendation No. 8 also talks about youth services; and recommendation No. 9 states `That the ABC should make use of Australia's creative resources'. That is fine. Then we get on to recommendation No. 15, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the ABC moves to outsource the majority of non&hyphen;news and current affairs television production over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I see some conflict there because there are many very good programs that are sourced and produced within the ABC for rural areas and specifically designed as rural programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same goes for children's programs. They are made in-house. I am thinking of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bananas in Pyjamas</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playschool</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No amount of my pleading, orders or anything else will make them switch off Triple J. It was very interesting when the people of Cobar in western New South Wales were given a choice of Radio National or Triple J. The community was in uproar. There were public meetings and hundreds of people at those public meetings because they were being offered Radio National and they wanted Triple J. They were given Triple J. The kids in Cobar are happy and the parents are happy because the kids have something to listen to. They have sources of information. I keep saying to the parents, `Listen to the words,' but the parents are happy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had no complaints about Triple J from this area. The kids, the adolescents are getting information they require, are hearing programs that relate to their needs, are hearing thoughts expressed that express the turmoil that they may well be feeling as they go through adolescence&mdash;and adolescence is not an easy stage. So this becomes vitally important. Obviously the people of this country, be it in the country or the city, like Triple J.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the expansion of the Triple J network cancelled. That is a shame. This means that many in the smaller areas and rural areas are going to miss out. That is something the government should really think very closely about. They are going to have to review their cabinet submissions. They are going to have to review this again when it goes to the ERC in the current budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of vital importance that these programs that are in demand, that are some of the most popular programs on any radio station in Australia, that have a listening audience that no other radio station can match because of the content, are continued. The content is pitched to the market and the market likes the content, and that is why they are listening. It is for no other reason. It is the content they want. It is vitally important that it is continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me greatly that Senator Coonan talked about Triple J's effect upon the rock music industry in Australia because it allowed a number of small bands to actually get airplay, to progress and to make their way in the world and then likened that to program production. I would remind Senator Coonan there is a vast difference between program production and the work that would go into a series and an independent person or a group making a record. When you have a production house, you do not want to be stopping and starting. Senator Coonan likened this to record production in the rock areas, and we all know that there are many bands and many groups that come and go. We cannot afford to have that sort of thing happening in the production area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has been at the forefront with its own record label in the regeneration, the extension and the rebirth of the country music industry in this country. It has had a major input into the regeneration of that. That has proved to be the boom for so many artists, for so many people in this country, and has led us to not only being internationally competitive on that but also providing jobs for people. But they do not seem to be caring too much. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="317">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have concerns when I think of the future. Let us look at the cabinet submission, particularly at attachment D, which is the coordination comments. The Department of Finance was `strongly opposed to the submission's recommendations' because `the submission provides no strategy for achieving the required contribution by the portfolio to the government's savings targets'. It cautioned against the review that was proposed because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They would create an opportunity for the ABC's constituents to place pressure on the Government to retain or expand the ABC in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How right they were&mdash;11,000 submissions. I wonder what Finance's reaction is going to be to the Mansfield report. I wonder what is going to happen next time in the ERC because we all know the stories of Finance&mdash;that is, they are a legend in getting their way or almost being like a lover slighted. They do not like having their recommendations ignored, particularly when they state openly that it would create an opportunity for constituents to place pressure and, as I say, 11,000 of them did. Treasury is critical because it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . notes that the Minister's recommendations do not identify means of achieving savings of $50m commencing in 1997-98, as was the clear intention in ERC's decision of 3 June. The Minister's earlier submission noted that the introduction of advertising on the ABC could achieve revenues of this order, thus allowing budgetary savings without reducing the overall funding available to the ABC for the provision of its services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, of course, Mr Mansfield has come out saying there should be no advertising. So Treasury's obviously going to have to send the minister back again to say, `Where's the $55 million going to come from because that particular source of the $50&hyphen;odd million revenue', according to Mr Mansfield&mdash;and I have not heard anybody reject this position&mdash;`should not be involved in advertising.' I wholeheartedly agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for watching the ABC is that you do not get rotten ads all the time. You can actually follow a program and not have your train of thought interrupted. So I would suggest people look very carefully and ponder what those two departments have said because they have certainly sent a warning 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there to the minister that they did not like and did not agree with what he was proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In winding up, I would like to draw attention to an area that I am getting a little concerned about and that is things we read in papers such as yesterday's. One of the things we are very proud about the ABC for is its editorial independence  and its board's independence. But yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> had a headline on page 5 of `Warning of stark choice for the ABC'. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister . . . has warned the national broadcaster that it must quickly implement recommendations to contract out most of its television production or risk being left behind in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When the minister is saying these sorts of things one has to wonder how much independence the ABC is going to be allowed to have under its new charter. I hear some of my parliamentary colleagues in rural areas saying, `We will not see the ABC changed out here. I will give you a guarantee.' One again has to wonder just what this government is doing to the independence of the ABC. That is another issue that people need to monitor very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield report has done some good things. It has outlined a number of very important issues. The previous speakers have outlined a number of very important points. I wholeheartedly support the position and the motion of Senator Schacht. The ABC is a national institution. The ABC is of the utmost importance to all Australians and has significant international consequences and values as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this very important matter of general business and to support the motion put forward by Senator Schacht. Yesterday in this chamber we debated a matter of public importance relating to the ABC and the Mansfield report. In particular, we highlighted the double&hyphen;speak, the deception and the failure of the current Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to honour the promises so solemnly made both in opposition and at the last election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="318">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my contribution yesterday, I highlighted from the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS>, from the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, the clear, unambiguous recommendations put forward by that committee. I remind the Senate that that was a committee instigated and chaired by none other than Senator Alston, the then shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt at all that, after quite an extensive series of hearings by members of the committee involving public submissions and submissions from government departments and from the ABC itself, the recommendations put forward in that report represented the position of the then opposition. It represented the public position of the then opposition on the ABC. But we know that they have always had another position. They had an under&hyphen;the&hyphen;table position. We know that because they have always had this view that whenever they could get the chance, if they ever got into government, they would get stuck into the ABC. They would try to reduce its funding, emasculate its activities, narrow its services and direct its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report that Senator Alston brought down as chairman of that committee contained many fine recommendations supported by all parties. It was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS>. Of course, we now know that the real agenda of the then opposition, now the government, was that the term `Our ABC' really meant the coalition's ABC. That is what they really wanted. But they continue to maintain this fiction&mdash;this facade&mdash;that they support an independent, effective and well&hyphen;funded public broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that report in March 1995, one year before the election, on the subject of funding Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore recommends that where the Parliament requires the ABC to undertake new Charter activities or to expand existing Charter activities, it should provide funds sufficient to ensure that existing activities are not adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Remember that recommendation, honourable senators, when you consider what this government has in store for Radio Australia and Australia Television. Remember what that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommendation from Senator Alston said when you look at what was put before the cabinet in the budget considerations last year: proposals to get rid of Radio Australia, to sell off Australia Television and to return to the budget funds that had been advanced to the ABC for the development of pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the complete opposite of what was being recommended only 12 months earlier and clearly was being put forward as the considered views of Senator Alston, which was to provide more funds for these additional charter activities. In that report, Senator Alston and the committee went on to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the maintenance of ABC funding at least at its current level, the continuation of the triennial funding arrangements and the continued application of the Non-Farm GDP deflator.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Time does not permit me to go into the complex debate about the non-farm GDP deflator. The clear expectation is for more funds but, certainly, it is a recommendation for maintenance at its current level and also a recommendation to continue triennial funding. They were the recommendations of Senator Alston in March 1995 in his own committee's report. It was a select committee set up at the instigation of the opposition at the time, the coalition, to look into the activities of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Some other recommendations in the report demonstrated some of the real intent of the then opposition&mdash;the now government&mdash;and Senator Alston. For instance, they recommended that any future ABC board member nominee should appear before a parliamentary committee to be grilled about their credentials for such an appointment. Talk about political control! What sort of a recommendation was that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to acknowledge that the person who was appointed as the new chair of the ABC, Mr Donald McDonald, was a good appointment. I have met Mr McDonald on a number of occasions in his previous role with the Australian Opera and I believe he is a good appointment, notwithstanding his quite clear political allegiances to the Liberal Party and particularly to the Prime Minister (Mr How 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="319"> ard). I honestly hope that Donald McDonald takes notice of most of the recommendations in the Mansfield report and ignores the pressure and the undoubted intimidation that will come from this government as it prepares to get stuck further into the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government has made a habit of cutting funding to government departments, to government instrumentalities and to enterprises and then setting up an inquiry to review their operations. Senator Vanstone did that in higher education. She ripped 10 per cent or so out of the budget&mdash;$1.5 billion out of higher education&mdash;and then set up a review and said, `We're going to have a look at how it is all going and how it is going to survive in the future.' We are already seeing the effects of that, and the review has only just started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, on this occasion the minister for communications has gone to the cabinet with two options on funding. One option is to take $55 million out of the budget of the ABC, get rid of triennial funding, impose the efficiency dividend and set up a review&mdash;and see how the ABC can function after that. The second and more draconian option is to get into them in a big way right at the outset and take a minimum of $135 million out of their funding, which is over 25 per cent of the ABC budget. That is what is put forward by this minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no proposal in line with his own representations that says, `Let's actually maintain the existing levels of funding for the ABC and maybe let's even look at giving them some extra funds so they can do some of the things that need to be done, such as upgrading the equipment and expanding the Australia Television service.' No, none of that. The options are to cut $55 million, cut off one arm; or cut $135 million, cut off both arms and probably a couple of legs as well&mdash;and then have a review. In that context, there is no doubt that they expected the review to be something that would deliver them the opportunity to hop into the ABC further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that Senator Alston has been exposed and found out with the leaked cabinet documents, he continues to try to obfuscate his way through his clear breach of promise. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know that, on election night, he used the same words to Jim Middleton as he used in the recommendation in his own report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jim Middleton: First of all the commitment close to home about the ABC and commitment to maintain funding in real terms of the coming parliament, does that stand?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston: Absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said he was going to honour all their commitments. Of course, that was also in their policy. Their policy was to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. Senator Alston says, `That was only really for the first year of the coalition government.' There is not a person in Australia who believes that and, increasingly, we see that the word of this government cannot be relied upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister forgets things. The Prime Minister forgets things&mdash;forgets things that are so important that they could never be forgotten. The minister does not know whether he or his office prepared a submission. He could not recall whether he had signed off on it. Frankly, the minister thinks up an excuse on his feet on the spur of the moment, ducking and diving to get out of what is clearly acknowledged to be a breach of coalition promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Alston has been found out because in his own cabinet submission he acknowledged that it was a breach of the coalition promise. It said up there on the front page that the options examined in the submission were inconsistent with the government election commitments. He acknowledged that he told the cabinet that these two options were going to get the government into a lot of trouble because the people were going to complain that it is a breach of the election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happened? The government set up the Mansfield review and there is no doubt that they gave the Mansfield review riding instructions. But, fortunately, the overwhelming response of thousands of Australians&mdash;representing, I would submit, millions of Australians&mdash;made it abundantly clear to Mr Mansfield that he should act independently of this pressure and come down with a report that backed up the ABC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="320">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that if you look at the actual report of Mr Mansfield, you will see there, contained in the appendixes, what this minister was looking for. First of all, he had the $55 million taken out of their budget. Secondly, he had clearly in mind further cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the terms of reference he talked about a more focused role for the ABC; that is what the government seeks. He also said that the review should `have regard to the need for consistency between the cost of future ABC operations and the Government's broader fiscal strategy'. Well, we know what the government's broader fiscal strategy was&mdash;reduce the budget of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the media release issued by the minister, contained as Appendix 1, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will be undertaking a Review of the ABC which would re&hyphen;define and re&hyphen;position the national broadcaster for the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Redefine the national broadcaster in the image of this minister and the coalition. Further, the media release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In examining the ABC and the very significant future funding pressures which its many activities are likely to place on the budget, the Government has decided that the current level of funding cannot continue indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, they took away the $55 million, imposed the efficiency dividend and suspended triennial funding. Further in his media release he said about Australia Television:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also ask the ABC to explore the possibility of delivering the services currently being provided by Australia Television more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will discuss with the ABC Board the scope for ensuring the maintenance of ABC program content on Australia Television . . . while tendering the operation of the service to the commercial sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the minister said in his media release at the time that the inquiry was set up. It is all consistent with what was in the leaked cabinet document because in that document statements appear such as that either option will mean the loss of some ABC services. It was acknowledged that services like Triple J, Classic FM, Radio Australia and Australia Television could disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government also had in mind was eventually to have the opportunity legislative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly to get further stuck into the ABC. What they were hoping to get out of this report were proposals which might give them the opportunity to narrow down substantially the ABC charter. Fortunately for all Australians, Mr Mansfield did not cop it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just very quickly go to the report. On page 11, Mr Mansfield acknowledged that he received many submissions questioning the need for review of the ABC's role and functions. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the ABC's demonstrated capacity to deliver quality programming over the last 64 years, there is a strong view among its audience that it should be left alone to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you look at all the other submissions that were made, which recognised the value of specific parts of the ABC whether it be television or radio, it is clear that they overwhelmingly supported the view that, really, this review did not have to take place; that the ABC was going along pretty well as it was; it could do with some more funding; and the public did not want it being slashed to pieces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know my colleague, Senator Gibbs, wants to make a few remarks in this debate so I will finish on this note. But I hope to have an opportunity on another occasion to contribute further. The bulk of the recommendations of Mr Mansfield are very good. What he has done is re&hyphen;endorse the role of the ABC as a comprehensive broadcaster and recommend that most, if not all, of its services should be retained. He has particularly acknowledged that it needs certainty of funding through triennial funding and that it should have increased funding because it should be able to retain the proceeds of any sales of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must say that I am particularly concerned about his proposals on Radio Australia, on ATV and on outsourcing&mdash;and others have spoken about that&mdash;because there is no doubt that they are important services that the ABC provides. There is no doubt that Mr Mansfield came to the conclusions that he did because it was already clear to him that he had Hobson's choice, that the government had ripped away the funding&mdash;the $55 million&mdash;and that something had to give if that was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="321"> going to continue. He was forced to look at what may be sold off or closed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in any other circumstances, there is no doubt that even he would have recommended the importance of those operations. As he acknowledges, there may still be a place for them to continue, albeit in another form. We reject those recommendations but we understand the context in which they were made even though they should not be adopted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting Senator Schacht's motion, I particularly want to welcome the support that Mr Mansfield gave in recommendation 6 to the regional services that the ABC provides. I also want to call on the government to make a separate funding allocation to provide a service similar to Radio Australia and Australia Television. In doing so, I would like to point out to the senators opposite that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, has written to the Australian High Commissioner, David Irvine, expressing `considerable concern' about the moves to terminate Radio Australia broadcasting services. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are undoubtedly aware, Papua New Guinea, as a developing nation and regional focal point, has come to depend on Radio Australia as representative of excellence in broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He has offered to take a $1 million dollar cut to aid for PNG to help save Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a large state like Queensland, the regional services provided by the ABC are essential in providing a good quality of life to the local population. The news and current affairs services, the quality programming and the various sports programs are essential in giving people in this vast continent a choice. I was always under the impression that the good senators opposite held dearly to the philosophy that everyone should have a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of regional Queensland cannot go to the latest opera, classical concert or other cultural events as can the people in Sydney or Melbourne. The ABC's Classic FM provides a wealth of classical music that can be enjoyed by those who enjoy this type of music. Similarly, not everyone in regional Queensland or regional Australia can afford to travel to one of the capital cities to see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their favourite concert or watch their favourite football or netball team play a major game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC also produces some quality children's programs. Children in more isolated areas have a right to receive programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS> which are watched by children around the country and are educational as well as fun for young viewers. The presenters of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS> are virtually mobbed by their young fans when they go on tour. It would be a sad indictment of this government if the children of the United States of America could enjoy characters like our Bananas in Pyjamas and the children of rural and regional Australia could not. It is essential that these characters and programs are adequately funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reminiscing, I am sure many of my fellow senators tuned into the ABC daily to listen to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jason and the Argonauts</EMPHASIS>, a program which taught children to, among other things, write, and encouraged an interest in exploration. How many, like me, were Argonauts? For generations, the ABC has been the social fabric of Australia. It has provided rural Australia in particular with a wide spectrum of entertainment and information. Even programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS> provided relief and light entertainment to many women isolated on large properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC also provided, and continues to provide, the capacity for quality public debate on numerous issues. Quality public debate can only be carried out when the community is educated, informed and aware of all the issues involved in any particular debate. The ABC provides the forum for such public debate. It provides information on issues in an unbiased way and free from political interference and commercial considerations. It does not have to make a choice on whether or not a subject has enough market appeal to bring in adequate revenue from advertising. It makes a moral decision on whether the public needs to be informed. It also does not have to create sensationalism and demean the entire quality of the television medium. Listening to the ABC is about choice and about quality. Although it depends on individual preferences, there can be some pretty poor alternatives to the ABC in some regional areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="322">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many viewers and listeners who prefer the ABC. There are also many who appreciate the fact that there is no advertising on the ABC. Another point that this motion supports is the legislative prohibition on advertising and sponsorship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this government going to support the maintenance of these regional services? When it comes to the vote on this motion, it will be interesting to see whether senators opposite will support ongoing services to regional Australia. After all, many of them claim that they represent the regional and rural population. I am sure that the voters in regional and rural Queensland will be very interested in how my government colleagues from Queensland vote on this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a broader note, the funding of a service similar to Radio Australia is of vital regional importance. We are, after all, very close to South&hyphen;East Asia. There are many smaller countries and poor countries that cannot afford to provide the type of quality television and radio broadcasting services that the ABC provides. Australia provides not only a service that assists such countries, but, in doing so, develops a supporting relationship with these countries which can stand it in good stead in the future. There are countries in the area which do not have access to a local uncensored radio news service. Are we going to let the Voice of America be the only alternative available to these countries. Do we want people in these countries to learn more about Australia and what we are doing, or do we want them to have America&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the countries that was a DIFF recipient was Indonesia. It seems a little bit incongruous that we are debating this joint standing committee report on the export of services to Indonesia on the same day as we have before us the reply from the government on DIFF. It just strikes me as a little bit unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the joint committee points out that Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country. It has a growing middle class but, as the report also points out, it has emerging budget deficit problems and a growing foreign debt. There are remaining inequities between the well off and the poor, unsettled industrial relations, a shortage of skilled labour and a challenge involved in maintaining a strong export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the DIFF inquiry we heard from a number of DIFF applicants who had been involved in Indonesia and who had been, through DIFF, providing, or attempting to provide, services to that country. One of the best witnesses we had before us gave us information about proposals to take education to the rural areas and the remote islands of Indonesia for those children with disabilities. Because of the cancellation of DIFF, this program will not go ahead. The provision of education for children with disabilities in the remote rural areas and the remote islands of Indonesia will be delayed because this government wants to abolish the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would have been opportunities in the service export area for small companies&mdash;despite what the minister said, they are only small businesses&mdash;to get together to form  consortiums to provide these types of services. If the DIFF program had continued, these companies would have had better potential and better ability to export further 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services into Indonesia. But this government has chopped off, at the first step, the ability of Australian companies to export services to that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me exceedingly short sighted on the part of the government to do this because it is depriving Australian businesses of export potential. It also seems to me extremely uncaring that there should be no social compassion for the needs of young children in the remote areas of Indonesia who have disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad indictment of this government that it does not look at the total perspective of the needs of Australia and our industries. It is prepared to chop off a program that benefited Indonesian children with disabilities living in remote areas and it is prepared to chop off the potential for Australian companies to increase their service exports to that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had been able to get these programs up and running, the wealthier countries that could have afforded to buy these services would have been able to see them. They would have known what they were going to buy, and known what they had the potential to achieve. They would have learnt from these programs. But, no, not this government. It hops in and chops the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the committee reports&mdash;the majority and minority reports&mdash;was `Does not accept this recommendation. Does not accept this recommendation.' Even in the minority report from the government members, the government was not prepared to amend the terms of reference for the Simons review on the advice or the suggestion of the government members. One has to wonder what sort of budgetary decisions are being made by this government when it is not prepared to take any notice at all of its government members who have sat through many days of hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just strikes me that there is&mdash;I do not want to say double standards&mdash;certainly a great contrast when we look at the report that deals with Australia's service exports to Indonesia. I am not saying that we do not have the potential to do a lot of work in this area. What I am saying is that you do not just look at one aspect of how you can conduct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="324"> business and one thing you can do in Indonesia. You have to look at what you are going to do across the board for the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DIFF was an excellent program&mdash;a first&hyphen;class program. There are many small companies in this country that were able to gain a foothold with our neighbours in Asia. They were able to get a toehold in the business and sale of industries in Asian countries. We need to encourage them to grow and to export. We need to give them an opportunity to learn about what is required when you are exporting to our near neighbours, where there is a different language and culture. English is not their main language. We English speaking countries do have a fairly arrogant attitude that everybody else should speak English and that, if you do not speak English, then you are somewhat of a lesser person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have been involved in trading in the area are learning very quickly the importance of learning that language. Those companies that were involved in DIFF learnt very quickly what a valuable product it was. The abolition of it must have an impact. It was predicted by these companies to have a major impact on the sale of our export services to these countries. For that reason, the government is to be severely criticised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a very small amount of the Senate's time this evening to add a brief note to additional comments on a matter I raised in May 1994 concerning language standards. On that occasion, I drew the Senate's attention to the poor usage of apostrophes on the two information tablets situated in front of Old Parliament House. At that time, a constituent of mine who was visiting Canberra was aghast at the incorrect use of the apostrophe by whoever had prepared the information. After being told that the matter was too costly to correct, I was happy to later 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> receive information that the signs had in fact been corrected. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While I am by no means attempting to set myself up as a perfectionist in these matters, I am most concerned at what appears to be a general decline not so much in the actual standards of correct spelling and grammar usage but rather in people's attitudes to whether it even matters. Just recently, I had some correspondence with the Kellogg breakfast cereal company over their marketing usage of the letter `K' to the extent that they were putting in front of Australian school children each morning a product with the word `complete' spelt  `Komplete', as in their product Komplete Muesli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While their response to my raising this concern with them was sympathetic and understanding, they were unprepared to accept that their actions did anything harmful towards the process of educating Australia's children to spell correctly. I wish to disagree. Senators themselves may be well aware that their staff members are generally guided by personal computer spelling systems which correct documents using an American system of spelling. While this is not always a problem, it sometimes offers suggested spellings that are not totally appropriate to common Australian usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem I am constantly faced with is the inappropriate use of the apostrophe in the word `its'. `Its' is only lengthened with the inclusion of an apostrophe when the word is the shortened form of the two words `it is'. A common error is to write `its' with an apostrophe or `it's' without the apostrophe or vice versa. As with much of our distinctive and confusing English language, this is a matter that is best learnt by knowing the particular situation rather than trying to rely on the application of broad rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I refer to another common error in usage, which is regularly to be heard, dare I be so reckless as to say it, even on our venerable ABC. This concerns the difference between `less' and `fewer'. For these words, there is a very simple guide. `Less' refers to quantity while `fewer' refers to number. As I say, I am not a perfectionist in these matters and I have no doubt broken multiple rules of grammar over the years, even in this speech. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="325"> However, when one sees simple errors used with such regularity, it raises some doubts as to whether our standards are being held in as high regard as they once were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this place, it can be reasonably expected that most people have received a little more than basic education. Let us try to set good standards in some of these simpler matters. At the same time, I think it is appropriate that I take this opportunity to compliment the Hansard staff on their high standard of use of the English language. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="325"><TITLE>Northern Territory: Growth</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make some remarks on the adjournment debate tonight in response to the document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A northern focus</EMPHASIS>, the statement issued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), which Senator Tambling spoke about on the adjournment debate last night. That statement is the federal government's response to the report of the Committee on Darwin. Senator Tambling will not be surprised to know that I have a different view from him on the benefit of this report to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in doing so that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Tambling) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Shane Stone, have publicly welcomed Mr Sharp's statement. Indeed, Mr Stone and Senator Tambling have both claimed that it is a `shot in the arm for Territory development.' I beg to differ. The minister's statement is a crude and offensive attempt to rewrite the recent history of Commonwealth involvement in northern development in order to mask the Howard government's appalling lack of commitment to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I guess we should be thankful for small mercies, at least on this occasion. Senator Tambling and the chief minister are attempting to at least sing the same tune on this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important issue. The reason I make that point is that I have a copy here of a newspaper clipping from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News </EMPHASIS>of 30 June 1995, which clearly demonstrates that they were very much at odds when the Wran report was released in June 1995. The newspaper story, which was quite a prominent one, is headed `Wran report puts CLP pair at odds'. The opening paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Minister Shane Stone and CLP Territory Senator Grant Tambling disagree about the worth of the Committee on Darwin report, released yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Tambling is quoted in this report as saying that the Wran report was a waste of money. He described it as `a feeble and politically safe document'. The chief minister, on the other hand, recognised the worth of a number of the committee's recommendations and described the reports from the 18 consultancies engaged by the committee as `an enormous resource', which indeed they are and remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get the sense from reading the minister's statement that it was written by someone in Canberra with instructions to lower the boom firmly but gently. This begins in the first two paragraphs with a completely erroneous statement that the previous Labor government tabled the report of this committee in June last year in the Senate `almost as an embarrassed afterthought'. The minister then claims that the Wran committee report was `a damp squid'&mdash;I am sure that the minister meant to say `squib'&mdash;which failed to capture the potential and spirit of optimism about one of the country's most dynamic and outward looking regions. This misrepresentation continues with the claim that the Darwin based Office of Northern Development began life in 1992 under a meaningful charter but `lost its way in latter years' and `lost credibility' across the north as the federal government's main source of information and advice and, thus, influence with Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, sadly, the Office of Northern Development is just lost. The Office of Northern Development was lost when this minister decided last year to close down the entire Regional Development Division of the De 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="326"> partment of Transport and Regional Development, with the loss of 220 jobs. This was announced without any warning before the budget last August in order to lop $150 million off the budget bottom line. You may recall that the minister issued a press statement at the time stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I said at the time, and it remains the case, that this is the most appalling statement&mdash;emanating from Canberra and affecting those living outside Sydney or Melbourne&mdash;I have seen in my 20 years in politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I venture to suggest that when the minister took the decision to lop off the Regional Development Division he probably had no idea that the Office of Northern Development was actually housed within it. Certainly, this came as a complete shock to his parliamentary secretary at the time, Senator Tambling. He was literally struck dumb by the closure of the office. The Darwin media could not get a word out of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not surprised because the decision came only weeks after Senator Tambling, who then had prime responsibility for regional development, had given public assurances that the Office of Northern Development would not be closed. Senator Tambling pointed out in the press statement announcing his appointment as parliamentary secretary that he had been given particular responsibility for regional development. Now that they have closed down the division Senator Tambling has moved to Social Security. I am not surprised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of Northern Development was involved in a range of key projects when it was closed down. It resulted in the loss of more than 20 jobs out of Darwin. Importantly, it was also coordinating the work of the joint territory&hyphen;federal government task force which was progressing the implementation of the Wran committee recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also busily implementing a major research effort to develop a regional development program for the territory. Let us not forget that the Howard government took the decision to close down the $150 million regional development program before it had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even received the McKinsey report, which it had commissioned at cost of $700,000 and which was designed to help it decide on the future of the program. That report found that after only 18 months under the previous Labor government, the regional development program had made a significant start in rejuvenating leadership in Australia's regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the Office of Northern Development was closed down I said that it was a victory for the bureaucrats in Canberra who had never made any secret of the fact that they were distinctly uncomfortable with the concept of a highly credible Darwin based Commonwealth agency which was free to range across all portfolios and actually got something done. I said that it also clearly showed the Northern Territory had lost its voice in government in Canberra. If you have any doubt about that, have a look at the press release issued by Senator Tambling on this matter and the statement issued by the minister. The key points in both those statements are exactly the same word for word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling simply recycled his former master's voice for local consumption. In essence, the statement says that the Office of Northern Development will stay closed. The Howard government will not pick up the recommendations to fund the establishment of an AusAID regional project office in Darwin. It will not maintain a continued AusAID presence in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade office in the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to see that it adopts the same position on the proposed construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway that the former Labor government had in office&mdash;that is, the key to getting it built is private investment. This is after years of whingeing about this position when in opposition. It also says that the government will continue with Labor's $850 million defence build&hyphen;up in the north which is underpinning continued economic development in Darwin. It picks up a whole range of initiatives from the previous government and then seeks to claim them as its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not one single new initiative from this government for northern development. Senator Tambling came into the adjournment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="327"> debate last night and recycled large chunks of the minister's statement. He claimed, as Minister Sharp has, that this government's response to the committee report follows `extensive internal discussions within the Commonwealth bureaucracy and various departments and had very open consultations with the Northern Territory government'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What neither of them told the public, but what I know to be true, is that most of the work on the federal government's response to this committee had been finalised when it came to government. The lion's share of the work had in fact been done by a high level joint task force comprising federal and Northern Territory officials in February last year&mdash;just before the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling would recall this because he issued a press release during the campaign, as opposition spokesperson on regional development, claiming that the Wran report was `good research,' which had been gathering dust on a shelf somewhere in the Treasurer's office. We reminded him at the time of his previous position, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> on 30 June the previous year, which I have already referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then went on to point out to him that the then Minister for Regional Development, Brian Howe, was in fact the man whom Senator Tambling was supposed to be shadowing and not the Treasurer, who had carriage of the government's response. We also pointed out that Mr Howe had announced the appointment of the task force in November 1995 and the final Commonwealth officials paper on the 77 recommendations were due to be considered at a meeting of the joint task group in February last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say, I do not think that Senator Tambling, in terms of his statement that this response is a shot in the arm, has any credibility on the issue. The government's response is not in fact a shot in the arm for the territory; it is a shot in both feet. I must say in closing that, if I have committed the unforgivable sin of getting the apostrophes wrong, I am sure that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will correct them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I will be turning the Senate's attention once again to the failings of accountability in government. You may or may not be aware of recent revelations in Western Australia surrounding the activities of the Court government's former planning minister, Mr Richard Lewis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole period of Mr Lewis's time as planning minister has been fraught with controversy. Recently he has been the subject of a continuous barrage of criticism from the media and members of the community when it came to light that he made a number of controversial planning decisions during the period of his caretaker duties between 14 November and 9 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The caretaker convention requires there to be no controversial, sensitive or major decisions made by government from the time an election is called until a new government is sworn in. In Western Australia people do not have access to a readily available system to appeal against administrative decisions made by public servants and ministers such as they enjoy in the Commonwealth. The existing administrative system lacks comprehensiveness and consistency. In some important areas of government action, there are no appeal mechanisms at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Lewis's recent actions demonstrate, there is also the problem that where an appeal is possible it may be taken before a minister who can arbitrarily make decisions at his or her sole discretion, without giving reasons. This is an unacceptable state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential for corruption in the exercise of such powers is considerable. This is an area where there are some gaping holes in which executive fiat may operate unchecked and where the decisions of the minister are not subject to appeal or review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal and other state appeals bodies, where they exist, believe that a comprehensive, coherent and objective administrative appeals system improves government effectiveness, efficiency, openness, transparency and ac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="328"> countability and promotes higher standards of government administration and service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that a planning minister in Western Australia is able to determine administrative appeals raises enormous implications and questions of accountability. This fact was dwelt upon and recommendations, so far unheeded, were made by both the royal commission into WA Inc. and the Commission on Government inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal commission into WA Inc. reported that these sorts of ministerial powers and structures in government administration lead to improper, corrupt or illegal conduct. The inference of impropriety that automatically arises where a minister is involved in a determination of administrative appeals not only is unfair on the incumbent, but means that the system itself is brought into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two factors unquestionably facilitated the actions and events leading to the royal commission's inquiry into the administrative system. The first was the state of the administrative system itself. It was notable for its complexity, fragmentation, gaps in effective lines of accountability, lack of standardisation and susceptibility to the corrosive effects of political influence and manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second was the imposition upon that system of changes in the style and practice of administrative government, changes which were by no means unique to Western Australia, but which were not matched by safeguards which could protect the system itself from debilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal commission made a number of recommendations as to the reform of the administrative system. With regard to the state of the administrative system itself, the royal commission recommended that a complete review of its structure and organisation was required. However, the commissioners reported that it was inappropriate for the commission to undertake this review&mdash;that was the responsibility of the government&mdash;but that they would recommend some of the principles and constraints which should inform that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal commission into WA Inc. reported in 1992, five years ago. The WA govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment has yet to implement the recommendations and make changes to its administrative system. The manner in which the administrative system is presently structured, managed and regulated puts the public and at least parts of the system itself at risk. The commission's recommendations were aimed at minimising those risks, and the government's irresponsibility in continuing to maintain the status quo is unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government, which made its findings on the review of administrative decisions in July 1996, made a number of recommendations which included removing the power from ministers to determine administrative appeals. The Commission on Government recommended that an administrative review tribunal, which I will refer to as ART, should be established to help ensure administrative justice and thus act to prevent corrupt, illegal and improper conduct. The commission reported that the practice of ministers reviewing administrative decisions suffered from the perceived lack of independence and concern that partisan considerations could intrude on or influence decisions. The commission also recommended that there should be only one tier of external review and the proposed administrative review tribunal should become a single point of contact for any person seeking a review of any administrative decision made in the Western Australian public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aside from consolidating the structure of the administrative system and removing referral to the minister for the determination of administrative appeals, the commission was concerned that the public should have confidence in the accountability of the proposed ART.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission recommended that the operations and effectiveness of the ART should be open to public scrutiny and that it must operate in an open, transparent and accountable manner, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Auditor&hyphen;General's department and produce full annual reports and proper performance indicators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Court government's failure to implement the recommendations of both these inquiries&mdash;a royal commission and its own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="329"> appointed Commission on Government&mdash;demonstrates that the coalition in Western Australia is not concerned with preventing any appearance of or actual impropriety or corruption in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's disregard of the importance of its accountability to the people of Western Australia is epitomised in the recent activities of the former planning minister. During the period of caretaker government, Mr Lewis was busy overturning local council decisions on highly controversial matters at a time when he was accountable to no&hyphen;one. These decisions were not made by Mr Lewis, the managing director of a business&mdash;which is the unfortunate way coalitions throughout this country seem to view government&mdash;but were made by a minister of the government that ought to be accountable to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under no circumstances should the need for an extensive and comprehensive system of administrative decisions review be underestimated. Proper review of decisions which are disputed is an essential requirement for accountable government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="329"><TITLE>Development Import Finance Facility</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the adjournment debate I wish to very briefly address the government's response to the inquiry into the abolition of the development import finance facility&mdash;DIFF. The government's response to the inquiry into DIFF has identified what the government senators have asserted since the inception of the inquiry, namely, that it had been clear coalition election policy to abolish the DIFF scheme in its current form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given frequent criticisms of claimed merits and failings of DIFF as a means of efficiently delivering Australia's humanitarian aid obligations, it was high time that an independent review was carried out. The announcement of the Simons review well before the DIFF inquiry came to fruition clearly demonstrates the government's commitment to an independent review as to the place of a reformed mixed credit scheme to deliver aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons aid review has broad and wide ranging terms of reference which certainly comprehend an examination of the efficiency 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of DIFF as an aid delivery mechanism. The majority's concerns regarding the time and nature of any replacement mixed credit scheme are premature given the review currently under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As to the majority recommendations regarding projects that were in the pipeline at the time, the minority report clearly spells out details about the legal obligations and procedural considerations and drop&hyphen;out rates which counter the likelihood of claims that companies in receipt of a mere letter of advice would ultimately proceed to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, projects that had received an actual offer were allowed to proceed and certain other projects of high  priority in receipt of a letter of advice were also funded. It must have been patently obvious, following the government's decision to abolish the program, that any attempt by the opposition to secure continued funding for projects just in the pipeline in 1996-97 through the committee process was to be of little avail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the terms of the Senate inquiry and the findings of the majority and witnesses invited to give oral evidence, who were almost invariably beneficiaries of the scheme, were heavily skewed to the conclusion that DIFF projects provided an ideal mechanism to deliver developmental objectives and commercial benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any definitive review, the developmental outcomes of some of the projects were simply subjective and anecdotal. While there was some evidence to support the notion that concessional finance schemes can and in fact have produced positive outcomes where the project has sufficiently targeted humanitarian outcomes, reliance on responses from financial beneficiaries without more was clearly flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Scant attention was given to the fundamental question whether the clear commercial benefits to individual companies, in particular industry sectors, in fact provided net commercial benefits to Australia at an acceptable cost to taxpayers. Throughout the duration of the inquiry, committee members did not access all information necessary to form a concluded view as to DIFF's net economic benefits to the Australian economy. It is a question </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="330">
<PARA STYLE="Other">which requires resolution in the interests of the continuation or implementation of any concessional finance scheme. Taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going and the demands for securing value for money should not be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that further refinement of the selection process, the feasibility study requirements and the framework for conducting needs analysis may have improved the effectiveness of aid delivered via the DIFF scheme. However, as the scheme operated to 1 July 1996, DIFF clearly did not provide for effective aid delivery in a consistent manner, despite the anti&hyphen;poverty benefits of some individual projects. So its abolition should not have caused such an outcry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not since the Fitzgerald review has a review been given the charter to rethink how foreign aid can be delivered in consideration of poverty reduction, the development of permanent humanitarian outcomes and commercial objectives. There is much scope for the Simons review to be imaginative in its findings. It is to be hoped that the Simons review will address the matters material to the</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The proposed interim maximum permitted concentration (MPC) for cadmium in peanuts of 0.1 mg/kg is consistent with the proposal published by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) as part of the review of cadmium standards. There is no toxicity from cadmium below the internationally accepted safe level of intake of 70 1g/day/person and surveys show Australians are ingesting approximately 10&mdash;15 1g/day/person which indicates no concern for public health and safety. Peanuts contribute a minor fraction of this daily intake. Contrary to the statement in your question, there was no commitment at the 1995 workshop to maintain current MPCs for cadmium and it was recognised that several MPCs were established without adequate data and cannot be realistically applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is understood by ANZFA that the regular surveillance of imports of Chinese peanuts has detected a proportion of shipments of peanuts with cadmium levels above the current maximum permitted concentration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) deferred a decision to allow time for important efficacy and safety data from an additional clinical study to be presented. The company had presented a preliminary discussion of the results of the study at a late stage in the evaluation process. The Committee agreed that a decision should not be made until a final study report was submitted and evaluated in the usual manner. In doing so, it was only following normal and proper procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. However, the implication of the question is that this should have relevance to Australia. I would make two points:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) I have no intention of slavishly following what another country does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) As of 13 January 1997, Nevirapine had been approved for use in only two countries worldwide&mdash;USA and Argentina. It is currently being evaluated in several other countries, including Canada and New Zealand. An application for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="333"> approval has not yet been submitted in any European country, the United Kingdom or Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is therefore ahead of most of the rest of the world with regard to evaluating this drug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is not possible to say as approval by the ADEC does not guarantee Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. However, even if it did, one needs to weigh up the risks of making a drug available without adequate safety and efficacy data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should say that Australia has an outstanding record in fast&hyphen;tracking the evaluation of drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. In 1995&hyphen;96, the Therapeutic Goods Administration evaluated and the ADEC recommended approval of five important new drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. In most of these cases, Australia's decisions were in advance of  most of the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, there are procedures in place aimed at expediting evaluations of important new drugs whenever possible, whilst continuing to ensure that proper processes are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No. While I am particularly sympathetic to the needs and concerns of anybody facing a life&hyphen;threatening condition, I do not concede in this case that there is anything in need of remedy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. It is the government's stated objective in the National Forest Policy Statement, to protect biological diversity of species by establishing dedicated reserves of forests on public land. The reserves should be large enough to sustain areas of high quality habitat for all known elements of biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. The government of Victoria has established a minimum target for protecting Tiger Quolls in the wild.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Yes. The target is 3000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes. The Action Statement prepared under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, by Victorian zoologists, considers 3000 to be a minimum number to maintain viable populations and genetic diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) There is no scientific evidence available on the number of 3000 being necessary to maintain viable Tiger Quoll populations in Victoria. The number of 3000 is a reasonable theoretical population number derived at by Victorian zoologists, following identification of declining Tiger Quoll populations evidenced in records from survey work by the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) and others over the last 15&mdash;20 years. This has included forest block surveys, other surveys covering much of the state, and incidental reports by naturalists, researchers and NRE staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) One of the known strongholds of Tiger Quolls is the dry rain shadow areas of the Upper Snowy River in the Snowy River and Alpine National Parks, in East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No, but as part of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment of East Gippsland, the Federal Government, jointly with the Victorian Government, has determined that following identification 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="334"> of 50 Tiger Quoll detection sites, the conservation guideline in the East Gippsland Forest Management Plan will be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No. The Victorian Government will firstly identify 50 Tiger Quoll detection sites and then review its conservation guideline in the East Gippsland Forest Management Plan, to ensure adequate protection of the species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) No. There is a lack of adequate research to establish a target number of Tiger Quolls to be protected. As quolls are extremely difficult animals to detect, indirect methods for their protection are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) 50 Tiger Quoll detection sites have been set by NRE zoologists as an arbitrary target, to be followed by a review of the conservation guideline in the East Gippsland Forest Management Plan, in order to provide adequate protection of the species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) A target number of 50 Special Protection Zones for Tiger Quolls has not been set in the East Gippsland Forest Area. The conservation of a minimum population of 3000 adults is the statewide target. (i) Suitable habitat and existing populations are found in the Otways, along the Great Dividing Range and eastern Victoria, and the Mt Eccles area of south-western Victoria. (ii) Habitat conservation in these regions and specifically, in East Gippsland, will focus on establishing a network of areas within the likely home range of the recorded animal which may include conservation reserves, larger patches of Special Protection Zone, stream buffers, steep slopes and areas unsuitable for timber harvesting. (iii) The aim for the Otway and south-western populations is to have at least 300 adults while the aims for populations in the other regions including East Gippsland, have yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes. It is the Federal Government's assessment that the Special Protection Zones in the East Gippsland Forest Management Plan would provide suitable habitat for only a fraction of the Tiger Quolls with most of the known habitats located within the Alpine National Park, the Snowy River National Park and the Errinundra National Park. As stated in Question 5, a number of `50' Tiger Quolls has not been set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) I am satisfied that the conservation objective outlined in the Victorian Government's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Action Statement No 15, provides for the protection of adequate populations of Tiger Quoll so that the species can persist and continue to evolve into the future.</PARA>
