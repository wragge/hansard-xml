<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the measures contained in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R231">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . There are a number of measures in this bill to which I will refer. First of all, I note that this particular higher education funding bill departs from tradition; that is, it represents a break from the traditional structure of higher education bill funding in that it allows for the provision of funds for 1998 and earlier. I note there is no allocation for 1999 and 2000. I think you will find that a number of advocacy groups are very concerned about that change to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> triennium funding structure for higher education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be supporting the simplification of the remission of debt for the open learning scheme. I note that this government is the first government to preside over a universal up&hyphen;front fee payment for undergraduate education with the introduction of a gap fee. A gap fee is one that open learning students have no opportunity to defer. So although it can be argued that open learning is one way of making higher education more accessible to, say, traditionally disadvantaged groups, particularly those in remote or regional areas, the lack of opportunity to defer those payments is sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is also continuing the tradition of user pays begun under the former Labor government. I note the amount that the Commonwealth is granting towards the open learning system is only $218,000 in this bill, compared with around $9.5 million as recently as 1995. I am dismayed to see a diminution in the resources being allocated to open learning in this bill. In fact, it puts Australia at odds with the rest of the world which is increasingly recognising the joys and the possibilities of open learning and distance education. This bill also allows for the 25 per cent discount on some course contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably one of the biggest features of this bill is the rationalisation and restructuring program&mdash;$26 million over the next four years. While the Democrats support that additional money, particularly for regional and remote institutions, we treat this as an acknowledgment, as basically a concession by this government that, in fact, its regressive budget cuts have hit hardest at regional and remote institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be supporting the Labor Party's second reading amendment and we will seek to amend that with a second reading amendment of our own. We endorse the sentiments expressed by Senator Carr in his amendment, but we recognise, as our second reading amendment does, that this path of user pays was begun under the Hawke and Keating governments and simply entrenched at a rate of knots by the current coalition government. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5746">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also glad to see that the second reading amendment moved by the opposition makes recognition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, CIPS, which has been cut by this government. Under that scheme industry funded 40 per cent of a university place while the student and the Commonwealth made up the remaining 60 per cent. The loss of this scheme will hit specific institutions harder than others. For example, Charles Sturt University is losing 1,076 places, Deakin University is losing 505 places and Swinburne University of Technology is losing 528 places. It certainly puts paid to the government's rhetoric that somehow we are seeing an additional allocation of places, be they undergraduate or others, around the country this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Substantial losses like this cannot be overcome. It has been suggested by this government that the rationalisation and restructuring program will go some way towards addressing the loss of places like CIPS places. Certainly, while we welcome that package, it will not address any of the other symptoms of the coalition's savage budget cuts. We welcome the admission by the coalition that there is a funding crisis in our universities across the country, with regional and remote institutions being hit hardest, but this package will not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot from the minister who has responsibility for enrolments. I am surprised to see that still the minister insists that enrolments&mdash;that is, the final enrolments in institutions&mdash;certainly are stable or up in some places, but would not a better indicator of demand for higher education places be applications for enrolment? As has been said many times in this place, certainly by the Australian Democrats, applications for enrolment in tertiary education around this country this year are down. They are down across the board. In particular, mature age students have been hit hardest with up to a 17 per cent decline in some states and territories in relation to applications for enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was stunned to see the minister's press release last week which claimed that universities were `thriving' in light of all the information we have had from institutions and repre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sentative organisations that this is not the case. In fact, I note that today's paper refers to 36,000 overenrolments. Certainly the government has been quite keen to encourage overenrolments, especially if it does not have to pay the full HECS liable load cost. I think it is outrageous that institutions have not only had to deal with funding cuts but are now expected to cater for massive levels of overenrolment, never mind the impact that this has on course quality and teaching standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have not heard the real story of what is going on at universities from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We do know that 10,000 fewer mature age students have applied for places this year; that is, they were turned off from applying for university. They did not apply for enrolment this year, and I would bet my bottom dollar that it was the prohibitive cost of studying that has meant many of these students did not pursue the enrolment process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the University of Newcastle as an example. Presumably, this is an institution that would be targeted by the rationalisation and restructuring package, but many of the changes that have already taken place&mdash;the cuts that have been made&mdash;have radically affected this institution. So even these kinds of programs are not going to provide enough resources to make up for the cuts that have already been suffered. I will refer to just a few of the staffing and funding cuts which have to be taken into account. These cuts are a direct result of the government's budget changes last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the faculty of art and design, nine academic staff have been lost; in the faculty of education, 15 academic staff and three general staff have been lost; in the faculty of engineering, 11 academic staff and 20 general staff have been lost; in the faculty of medicine and health sciences, 14 academic and 30 general staff have gone; in the faculty of nursing, there is $340,000 worth of cuts, and six staff and three general staff have gone; in the faculty of science and maths, 18 academic staff and 13 general staff have gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These universities are not thriving, contrary to the minister's claims last week. The Uni 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5747"> versity of Newcastle is not thriving with 95 academic staff and 198 general staff being made redundant. It is shameful, and blame can be directly attributed to the federal government for these radical cuts and regressive changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the university may have fewer staff but, as the minister continues to maintain and certainly today's papers and overenrolment stories confirm, enrolments have been maintained. In fact, overenrolments in some institutions are incredibly high, class sizes have jumped, student contact hours have been reduced, and tutorial times and access have been reduced. This is the reality; these are the consequences of rising enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The library at the University of Newcastle has cut its budget by $900,000 and up to 21 library staff may be lost. So I am curious to hear the minister's response to that case study of a particular institution which has suffered from funding cuts over the last 12 to 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continually, there is this focus on final enrolments. When are we going to hear from the government an explanation for the drop in enrolment applications, in particular the drop in enrolment applications among mature age students? When I asked the minister in estimates whether she was concerned about the number of enrolments and perhaps that it was not such a benefit to have overenrolments in institutions that had suffered so many cuts, she replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if you have a lecture theatre in which there are&mdash;just for the sake of argument&mdash;20 spare seats, and you have got the lecturer, then the additional cost of overenrolling and filling up those seats is negligible, because you are only talking about extra course materials. Your infrastructure and all the rest of the stuff is there, the lights and everything are on in any event.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lights may be on, but what if nobody is home when a student needs assistance? What if there is a lack of resources, tutors or lecturers to help? What use is that? It takes more than a few spare seats and a light on to fill those extra 20 places and to run a university&mdash;something that I think this government is yet to grapple with, let alone comprehend.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases, the staff needed to ensure meaningful assessment are no longer there&mdash;certainly, at the University of Newcastle. Libraries have been cut and important means of educational assistance and support are going. Certainly at the University of Newcastle this is the case, and this is not an unusual situation. The staff levels are such that there are not the human resources to accommodate any extra students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Hunter region, the education sector employs more people than BHP. So this government is responsible for the enormous upheaval and trauma as a direct result of funding cuts by this government in previous budgets which face all those who live in that particular region. Whether it is their own job that is lost or whether it is a family member who is denied access to education or any one of the many activities, such as research and development which flow on from campus life, that region is affected. It is not an isolated example. The destruction and pain in regional Australia can also be seen at the Northern Territory University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory University has been forced to abandon its English department. It is extraordinary that in the Northern Territory, as far as we know, there is not an English literature department or access to English literature at an undergraduate level. This decision has been made in response, apparently, to the coalition's funding cuts. It has already been instituted over the recent semester break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staff from other disciplines, none of them related to English literature, will now be required to take on the existing load. That is not my idea of quality in education or access to courses and stability needed for universities to develop and, indeed, to thrive, to use the minister's terminology. So now we have an education sector where a university does not have an English department, in the case of the NTU, and where an entire territory population does not have an English department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon I will be going to the Australian National University where they are facing the closure of their classics department. So it is not an isolated case. This is not just restricted to regional universities. The quality 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5748"> of our education is under threat and yet students are paying more for this privilege. That disdain for equity and fairness is also contained in another measure in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 May Senator Vanstone issued a challenge to the Australian Democrats and the opposition to vote down&mdash;dare we vote down&mdash;the introduction of a 25 per cent discount for up&hyphen;front payments of HECS debts of over $500. If the media reports are correct&mdash;and I am always willing to place a little degree of scepticism when reading the media&mdash;then the minister stated that this change was good news for students and that this would not favour those richer students&mdash;that is, those students who had ready access to wealth or cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a 25 per cent discount for payments over $500 is only fair in the context that this same discount is already available for those students who have access to the wealth required to make a full and up-front payment of their liability before the census date. We described it as a bit like a mugger leaving you a tip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the majority of students who cannot afford to pay their HECS upfront this is a regressive measure. You only have to look at the statistics of the types of students who are making up-front payments to realise that. As recently as 1995 there is public policy advice on this that clearly shows that the students who have the ability to make those payments tend to be older, professional and, in many cases, working students. We do argue that it rewards those students who have access to wealth more so than others. That is the overwhelming direction of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a higher education system where students are not charged according to their eventual earnings but they are charged a combination of the cost of their course and their expected earnings, their potential earnings. I do not think that happens anywhere else in the world. The differential HECS is a tax on the income a student or a graduate may never earn. It is a system where someone doing secretarial studies or science is charged at the second highest level of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that the Labor Party created the HECS system where up&hyphen;front payment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was rewarded to such a degree that the wealthy were afforded a substantial advantage. So I do acknowledge that this government is perhaps trying to evenly distribute or make more widely available some of those discounts that were introduced by the former government. But it is an extension of a privilege that is not available to those students who do not have money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not content with lowering the threshold at which people repay their HECS debt to 27 per cent less than average weekly earnings&mdash;a measure which came into effect on 1 July&mdash;an additional burden which again raises the ire of HECS debtors against this government, they have now decided to make it easier for those people with money. If you cannot afford the up-front discount on your band one HECS debt for a three&hyphen;year degree you will owe $10,069. If you can afford to pay it upfront it will be $7,425. At the other end of the scale, take band three, the HECS debt at the end of three years is $17,682. The amount that you will have to pay courtesy of the discount for payment upfront is $12,375.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put simply, on graduation a student who has no choice but to defer their payment will have a HECS bill 43 per cent greater than the payments made by their more wealthy classmate. So if the person standing right next to them in the graduation ceremony has more money they will have less of a debt. According to Swindler's List, a recent study, that I am sure the minister is familiar with, by the Deakin University Students Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People earning well below average earnings could pay nearly 70% more for the same degree as someone earning $37,263 and more than three times the figure of someone who pays their HECS upfront . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government argues that they are not rewarding those with access to money. Since most women will earn less than and take longer than men to repay their HECS debt, `. . . more women will pay much more for their degrees than men'. That is the finding of Swindler's List. We know that women are less likely to repay their HECS debt. By the age of 30, they are five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debt. I am sure those statistics have altered only slightly since the NATSEM modelling of 1992. It is a bit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5749"> ironic considering this week is blue stocking week when we not only commemorate the first female academics but we seek to remove the barriers to participation and entry into higher education for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also amazed to hear the rhetoric in this chamber on Monday when the minister responded to a dorothy dixer about the fact that this government was not intending to leave young people with a great amount of debt because they had cleared the so-called budget black hole. This generation is the debt generation. More than ever before, young people are leaving universities, schools and so on with debts on their heads&mdash;debts the size of their parents' houses if you take into account a combination of HECS and Austudy loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a poor university the government is saying to you, `We will offer you a small amount of the moneys that we ripped away from you last year,'&mdash;in the form of the restructuring package&mdash;`but we will continue to rip you off for the next four years anyway.' If you are a poor or average student then the good news from this minister and this government is that you will get a discount on an up-front payment of more than $500. I presume that the government is hoping that the students who cannot afford $500 are not able to do the sums to see that yet again they are the ones who are being hit hardest and missing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that the government is rubbing salt into the wound. I have said that we will support this measure today because we will do anything to give some people an opportunity to repay their HECS debts, but what we object to vehemently is the fact that it is constantly the rich who are rewarded. Whether it is by this higher education policy under this government or the former government, the discounts benefit those with ready access to money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It added salt to the wounds when the minister dared us to vote down this measure. She added a double dare claiming that students have a tendency to want to complain and therefore we should support the measures. That tendency has never been more justified than it is now. Students have the right to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complain when they are still waiting to receive an Austudy payment. No&hyphen;one can convince me or them that it is appropriate that students who applied for their Austudy, say, in January or February should still be waiting for it in the middle of the year. We do have many examples of people who were still waiting for their Austudy notice of assessment in, say, June or July. They are still waiting today for reassessments or appeals. So the media attention may have been moved on, but I can assure you that those students will never forget how they were treated by this government and how this government handled their affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are indeed like the mugger leaving you a tip. Australian universities have been mugged of six per cent of their operating grant from now until the year 2001 and now they are being given a tip of $26 million in the restructuring package. Students are being told, `If you have ready access to wealth, we will give bonus too.' That is another slap in the face for those who are not able to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the coalition, the Australian Democrats believe in intergenerational equity. We believe in social justice, the right to a fair go and to participate fully in society regardless of wealth. That includes access to education regardless of background. We will support this bill today, but we will continue to do our utmost to restore quality and accessibility to the education system. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R231">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . There appears to be a perception that, over the 13&hyphen;year period that the Labor government was in power, there was a winding down of support for tertiary education. Nothing could be further from the truth, as funding was massively improved to this sector of education. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5750"> By the close of the previous government's 13&hyphen;year period in office, doubling of the tertiary intake was attained. That was no mean feat. I mention this because I am concerned that, as we all know, this government has been tinkering in the tertiary education sector; the result of which could not be better exemplified than by the introduction of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot fathom to what end this government has targeted the tertiary education sector so vigorously. The whole manner in which the universities have been treated by the government is saddening. We built up the tertiary sector over 13 years, and the government seems to be on track to destroy it within half that time. The government claims that, because of their efforts, they have strengthened the framework of this sector. It is claimed that this bill builds on this strong framework by supporting rationalisation of programs and joint development of infrastructure. We have now witnessed a massive cutting of funds, and savings made by changes to HECS. That will cause a curtailment in growth that I expect will be felt in the years ahead. It is difficult to gauge the effect of these cuts on the nation as a whole. Certainly, rural Australia has felt the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strong framework that this government talks about having built is a furphy. We know that institutions are struggling to attract investment capital for new technologies and teaching materials. We now know that the demands have become so great because of these cuts that the only way to get universities back up to speed and competing internationally is by a large injection of Commonwealth government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds provided under this bill are a step in the right direction, but they are a drop in the ocean as to what is required to clean up the mess that this government has initiated. Our young people have experienced and continue to experience first hand increases in their HECS charges with the introduction of the double whammy of lower repayment thresholds. It is difficult to see how the implementation in this bill of the budget proposal of a 25 per cent discount for partial up-front HECS payments of at least $500 or more will assist many of those struggling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> students and families who do not have adequate funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, students from lower socioeconomic bands who require assistance will not get it. There will be a shutting out, as in the old days, of those individuals from these bands. It is a shame, because it will not assist in developing our intellectual base. The cuts to the operating grants will not necessarily be felt immediately; they will have more of an impact in the years ahead. The cuts to operating grants have not stopped, either. In the year 2000, a further funding reduction of one per cent, realising $47.3 million, will be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a tough period for young adults with these cuts and savings being realised. They are in the front line. It must be hard for students, for example, to pay up&hyphen;front fees for attendance at optional study sessions. But then it has not been easy for the hardworking mums and dads who only want the best for their children in what is becoming an increasingly competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there are now 25 per cent fewer non&hyphen;fee paying university places available than there were a couple of years ago. I do not know how accurate that figure is, but it is very disturbing. I expect that parents from wealthy backgrounds will not be too concerned, but it is certainly going to be difficult for those parents who are less fortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been a tough period for our vice&hyphen;chancellors. They are alarmed about the way this government has caused future investment in the sector to be placed in doubt. The university administrators will find it difficult to put into place concrete plans to cope with the cuts because of the absence of an allocation of funding amounts beyond 1998. There is no doubt that there must be accountability in how we spend the tertiary sector dollar. But, for the federal government to cut to a stage whereby that cutting fundamentally damages the sector resulting in the necessity for there to be a redressing of the imbalance by introducing measures such as those contained in this bill, defies explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not go anywhere near far enough to assist higher education institutions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5751"> that have been crushed and will be further crushed, as I have explained. My home institution, the University of Tasmania&mdash;which should be playing a leading role in ensuring that our youth in regions like the North West Coast of Tasmania remain and receive quality education&mdash;has suffered because of the reduction of 160 jobs. All the social and economic commentators within the state are advising that a major problem is the retention of our young adults at tertiary level, so it is sad that the budget cuts have been levied so hard on the island of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope that the provisions in this bill will at least go some way towards ameliorating the damage caused. But, unfortunately, I will not hold my breath.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R231">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  is not one on which I feel enthusiastic about voting either for or against because both are problematic. Voting `no' votes against slight increases in funding and the discount in clarification of the debt. There are potentially some positive measures, but I will explain what some of these issues are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does three things: it provides an additional discount for students making voluntary contributions of $500 or more towards their HECS debt; it makes amendments to supplementary funding; and it clarifies when students' HECS debts can be waived. First of all, the provision of an additional discount for students making voluntary contributions of $500 or more towards their HECS debts. You need to have some basic economics to look at this kind of measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time that such measures have taken place. I remember seeing similar things under Labor. You have to wonder about long-term planning when it is necessary to bring forward expected payments of such a nature. It does not mean that extra money is coming into the system. Of course, when you give extra discounts, the total revenue that is coming in will in fact be less. It is a bit like what happened a few years ago when a great many health clubs in Australia got into financial trouble. Although they were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gaining revenue by selling life memberships they found out in the end that they had so many people on life memberships they were not getting in any new revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a similar kind of problem in this case in that what you have is an expected repayment at some stage. When you get short of money, you try to draw in that expected payment earlier but, of course, that leaves potential problems in the down years for that expected revenue which will no longer be coming at a later date. It is simply shifting the problem. It is not providing extra revenue; it is shifting the problem to later years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had long-term concerns about providing incentives for richer students to pay off their HECS debt. Although it reduces their debt, which the Greens (WA) support, it does not reduce the debt for all students, only those who can afford to pay. We then end up with a situation where poorer students who cannot pay their debt are suffering the full debt while students who can pay receive a 25 per cent discount or more on their HECS debt and are paying far less. This clearly is not an equitable repayment system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A related issue is the level of HECS repayments. Four per cent, five per cent or six per cent of a middle income is more than a tax on some people repaying their HECS debt involuntarily. One of my constituents put the high HECS repayments threshold as the reason why he and his wife may go bankrupt over the next fortnight. With the increase in the HECS repayment threshold from 1 July, the bank will foreclose on them with more money coming out of their bank accounts involuntarily. This puts enormous pressure on families where the ex-student trying to pay off their HECS debt is the sole income earner for the family. This is where the HECS debt does not just affect the person who is receiving an education but it also affects their ability to support their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, the sole income earner also paying the debt is a woman with a husband and children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They believe what the federal government is doing is very unfair. When she took a degree under the HECS system she believed the government at the time that the HECS repayments would be affordable for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5752"> people, but they are not. It is now an open matter that HECS is a tax on education, but for some that tax is crippling. It is ironic that even a conservative government which purports to represent families does not look at the impacts of the increased HECS repayments on young couples and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to amendments to supplementary funding, the $10.2 million in 1997-98 for restructuring and rationalising activities is no sweetener. It is to help universities implement the $1 billion in cuts by sacking staff, downsizing departments and so on. The money may also be used to help ex-colleges of advanced education which ran the bulk of shared industry places to restructure courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth industry places scheme, which paid for 60 per cent of an industry place while the industry funded the rest, has been scraped. The Greens found it difficult to see why the government would be subsidising industry training at universities and hope that industry will meet the shortfall in funds if they want university level training in their sectors to continue. It is funny, isn't it, that people are being asked to pay for services which you would normally expect taxpayers' money to pay for but industry is being subsidised for training which actually benefits them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to circumstances under which HECS debts can be waived, it is important that students are not charged for units they do not complete. However, under part 4, subsection 20(2)(c), the onus is on the student to apply to the secretary but this will not function well unless students know their rights in this regard. I hope the government makes debt remission a part of the HECS literature that is sent to each student periodically about their debt so that students can act in their own interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Normally, the legislation that is before us provides funding for the next triennium. However, this bill provides funding only for 1998 and not for 1999 and 2000. We talk about the necessity for certainty and for some sort of security within business, but it is interesting that the university sector is being held on tenterhooks. Why is this? One view is that the government is waiting for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> results of the higher education review in December 1997. The higher education sector is still in the throes of dealing with the government's 1996&hyphen;97 budget changes which cut a total of $623 million over four years from the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operating grants are to be cut by one per cent in 1997, three per cent in 1998 and one per cent in 1999. These budget changes have already had a massive effect on the student intake and socioeconomic background of students, course quality, courses offered, staff cuts and university infrastructure. At the same time, operating grants have been cut. The government forced universities to over enrol to mask the fact that the usual intake of students amongst higher scores was down. This means that limited dollars have to be stretched even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those students who have been prevented from attending university because of the cost, the youth allowance changes means that if they cannot afford to study they will not have an income at all. This is a callous and irresponsible government that does not want to invest in young people unless they are all of a particular social class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, therefore, will find myself out of the chamber when the vote for this bill takes place. But I would like to indicate that I will be supporting the ALP second reading amendment and the amendment to that amendment that has been moved by Senator Stott Despoja for the Australian Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak against the amendment moved to my second reading amendment by Senator Stott Despoja for the Australian Democrats. This is an amendment which argues that there was a funding decline of 13 per cent of equivalent full-time student units over the 13 year term of the Hawke-Keating governments. I put to the Senate that this amendment should be opposed because it is factually incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, there will be those around who would always argue that there should be more money allocated than has been allocated&mdash;and I do not dispute that claim that is often made. But to state, as it does, in this amendment that there was a funding decline of 13 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5753"> cent for effective full&hyphen;time student units over 13 years I maintain is just wrong. If the Democrats were arguing that there was a funding decline of seven per cent for the operating grants if measured on a per student basis, then I could argue the toss about that. But I would essentially have to acknowledge that there was a seven per cent decline in the operating grants if you measured them on that particular scale. What that statistic does is misrepresent the total amount of money that was actually spent in higher education under the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Higher education funding is measured on a student basis. That part is accurate, but there is a total amount of money that needs to be considered, not just one particular measure. Commonwealth higher education expenditure increased by four per cent between 1983 and 1997. That is more accurate. The increase was from $12,110 per student to $12,530 per student. But such figures take into account the full spending on higher education, not just one aspect of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What occurred was that the Commonwealth increased expenditure on higher education at a greater rate than it did on student places. Funding increased in real terms by 69 per cent from $3.1 billion in 1983 to $5.3 billion in 1997 under the Labor government. Over the same period, Commonwealth funded student places increased by 63 per cent from 260,000 EFTSU in 1983 to 424,500 EFTSU in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, operating grants per EFTSU did decrease by seven per cent from 11,600 in 1983 to 10,730 in 1997. But this decline in operating grants, the share of the total higher education funding, is due to the dramatic increases in funding for capital and research activities under the period of the Labor government. There was a massive transfer of research funding previously included in the operating grants to the Australian Research Council from 1989, so it was a matter of changing one particular column to another in terms of the way in which these calculations were made by the department. That accounts for the drop in this particular statistic. It was a measurement change that resulted in what appears to be a drop, as indicated in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> propaganda that the minister has been trying to push about in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the particular funds were transferred back to the universities. That is a fact. The funds into universities actually increased dramatically under Labor. Capital funding in 1997 in the last year of the triennium of the Labor government was $284 million&mdash;an increase of 440 per cent in terms of the base figure of 1983 which had capital funding of $52 million. Capital funding per EFTSU more than tripled during the period of the Labor government from $200 in 1983 to $670 in 1997. The research funding increased fivefold from $78 million in 1983 to $385 million in 1997. On a per EFTSU basis, research funding increased by 200 per cent from $300 in 1983 to $910 in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we do see the statistic pumped out every now and then in a more complete form in terms of the use of operating grants. I repeat: that figure can be accounted for simply by the changes in the calculations that were made. The measurements that were used were measuring different things. If you look at the total amount of funding spent on higher education over the period of the Labor government you see a change of 69 per cent in total expenditure by the Labor government on higher education&mdash;a massive shift in expenditure which reflected Labor's view that there should be a mass higher education sector in this country, that we should move to a democratic higher education sector in this country, and that there should be an opportunity for as many Australians as possible to go to university. I think in a large measure the Dawkins reforms were able to see that introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you saw under Labor was the increased capacity for ordinary Australians to actually attend a university. It was not perfect. I have made this point many times. We hear from the minister this red rag view that she now expresses that university should be open to the proletariat. I commend her for that. The truth of the matter is that the funding policies of this government prohibit that. They actually work in the opposite direction. We see from this government a move back to an elitist model of the 1950s that discourages 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5754"> working people from participating in the higher education sector in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does the Democrats no service whatsoever to come into the Senate and put a position on the table here which is factually incorrect.

It is a claim that the minister has propagated at recent estimates committee hearings. It is a claim which was advanced in what I would have thought was quite an expensive little exercise which tried to get the department to run out these distortions, to suggest that somehow the action taken by this government is to be legitimised in a manner that would suggest other than the facts&mdash;that this government has substantially cut moneys to the higher eduction sector, it has substantially undermined the quality of the university sector and it has substantially undermined the capacity of Australians to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R231">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  does a number of things. As senators have outlined, it has provisions relating to price movements for a number of university grants, the introduction of a 25 per cent discount for partial up&hyphen;front HECS payments of $500 or more, streamlining of arrangements for students applying for the remission of their HECS debts, and the introduction of the government's rationalisation and restructuring program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to comments made by senators, I want to make a number of brief comments on these changes. Senator Stott Despoja leaves me in a constant state of confusion as to what her views really are. On the one hand, Senator Stott Despoja puts out press releases saying, `Oh, this move by the government to give people a 25 per cent discount if they pay their HECS up front and can only pay $500 is unfair. This will benefit the rich.' On the other hand she says, `Well, if other people who pay all their HECS up front can get a 25 per cent discount, then in that context it is fair because, if you haven't got the money to pay all of your HECS up front, why should you miss out on the discount?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that. That is why we have introduced this change. Not everybody has the money to pay all their HECS up front. We want to help people who have less money and give them the same opportunity to get a discount. Senator Stott Despoja seems to understand that. She says, `In the context of this other discount being available if you pay it all off up front, then we will allow it and support it,' but in the next breath she rushes out and says, `This is advantaging the rich.' However, the whole purpose of this amendment is to ensure that more people can choose to have the option to pay a portion of their HECS up front and still get the discount.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5756">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the subject of HECS payments, I will respond to some of Senator Margetts's comments. Senator Margetts rightly points out that some people, in any event, will not have the money to pay up front. Even with the greater access we expect to get by virtue of this change&mdash;and we are grateful for the support of it&mdash;some people will still not be able to pay up front. I understand that. But as I am advised, and as I understand it, the reason why the discount is provided up front is that it is roughly the equivalent value of giving a student a long&hyphen;term, no real interest rate loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in this chamber will understand that the HECS debt is the contribution you make to your education; it is not the full cost. You do not have to pay it up front. One of the most creative aspects of Labor's time in office was the introduction of HECS, with the realisation that people could not necessarily pay up front, and thus allowing paying it back later and not putting a real interest rate on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to borrow money to buy a house, a car, a motorbike or whatever, you will not be able to borrow it with no real interest rate unless you borrow it from your family&mdash;from your mother or grandmother or someone. A bank will always want a real interest rate. Giving young Australians a loan, in effect, to cover their HECS contribution and saying, `You don't have to pay this back until later,' and not having a real interest rate on it, is a real gift. I understand that the value of a no real interest rate loan that can be paid off over a very long period of time roughly equates to the 25 per cent discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would obviously change depending on what real interest rates were at any particular time&mdash;and we only have to remind ourselves how high they were under Labor. I remind Senator Margetts that that is the reason that has been given to me for pitching it at that level. In a sense, both groups get a benefit: the student who wants to pay up front forgoes the opportunity of a long&hyphen;term no real interest rate loan and, in exchange for forgoing that, gets 25 per cent off HECS. However, I understand the difficulties you were referring to. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to operating grant funding per student. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways. We have produced a graph which has already been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. That graph shows that when Labor came into office it structured university funding so that operating grants&mdash;otherwise generally described as funding primarily available for teaching, although I understand that that can be disputed&mdash;were reduced per student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could cut a lot of money from universities tomorrow and, if you cut the equivalent in students, your funding per student would be the same. Equally, you could give a lot more money to universities&mdash;and there is no doubt that the higher education sector has been the beneficiary of more public funding for a very long time&mdash;but if you put in a bigger increase of students than money, you would debase the funding per student.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good shopper will always be able to confirm that, just because you pay more for something, it does not mean you are getting more. I know that the amount of dollars you spend on something is not always an indicator of quality, but it is one indicator of quality, and it should be taken into account. The facts are that, while more money was put into higher education&mdash;and nobody doubts that&mdash;the real test of how much is available to teach your son or daughter going to university is what the funding is per student. On that basis, the Labor government failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In operating grant terms, funding per student was around the $12,000 mark when Labor came into office in 1983. You took it down to under $11,000&mdash;to about $10,800 or $10,900&mdash;in 1991. That was the funding per student, so there was less money per student to teach them. Without doubt, you then started to repair the damage, but the changes we have made have largely been misunder 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5757"> stood in the community, and misunderstood as a consequence of the sorts of comments peddled by Senator Carr. It is true that this government has made significant savings in higher education. It is not true that we have cut money drastically from universities. Both of those statements can be true. Anyone who understands higher education funding will appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is broaden the base of funding. We have asked students to pay more, and students are now paying more. But universities around Australia have undoubtedly got more money this year than they had last year. The university sector is estimated to have&mdash;we can all argue at the edges&mdash;some $33 million more this year than last year. The savings we have made&mdash;in a sense, reducing the contribution we put in&mdash;have been achieved by getting the students to pay more, not by cutting money from universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When universities say, `We will have a one per cent, three per cent, one per cent and one per cent cut over four years,' what they are saying is that it is a cut to the money they thought they were going to have. If someone said to me, `You're getting a cut in your pay,' or if someone went up to a man or a woman on the street or a person on the Balmain ferry or in a Clapham omnibus&mdash;which is what I think it used to be described as&mdash;and said, `You're getting a cut in your pay,' they would think and I would think that you meant a cut in this year's pay. They do not think you are talking about not getting a pay rise they were hoping to get. In effect, I think that is a fair way to characterise what has happened to universities. They are not getting the pay rise they thought they were going to get. Their plans for their future operating grant funding have been cut, but this year they end up with more money than they had last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, I find it very, very difficult when universities say, `We have to shut this department because of what the government's done.' I want to say, `Hold on. Universities have got more money than last year. Why is this so?' Universities have to be responsible for managing themselves and what they do. You do not want a federal education minister trying to run 37 universities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come briefly to Senator Stott Despoja's remarks about the Northern Territory not having a full range of courses available. It is this government's view that there should be more diversity, freedom and choice in the higher education sector. We think the changes we have made have encouraged universities to follow that path. It was a farce from day one to suggest that we had a unified national system, that 37 universities around Australia were all the same. They never were and they never will be. More importantly, this government is prepared to say, `We don't want them to be.' We want them to be different. We want each university to follow the path that it feels is special for its course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that in Western Australia, for example, the universities are getting together and, as I understand it, moving very closely towards having a real focus on exploration, mining and petroleum research. What a perfect example of what Western Australia&mdash;the mining and exploration state&mdash;would want to focus on. If you said to me, `Would you be sorry if every university in Western Australia didn't offer an MBA?' I would say, `No. Why do we want every university offering the same thing?' So they will not all be offering the same thing. They will have to cut down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a smaller university and you try to offer everything to everyone, my prediction is that you will not be successful at it. You have to pick your niche and be good at that. That is what has to happen. So there is not an expectation that students will simply be able to walk into the university next door and do whatever subject they like and that universities have some obligation to offer every course. That makes them all the same. It makes them all plain. It does not allow any of them to pursue their particular paths of excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I have covered most of the points I wanted to respond to. I did want to highlight, as I have said, that operating grant funding per student has been kept stable by us. I think that is vitally important. We have increased research funding&mdash;as you know, Senator Carr&mdash;over and above the increases that Labor put into it, which were falling to decreases, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5758"> incidentally, in your out years. We have, nonetheless, in a very difficult budgetary climate, managed to put in more, as we have in a number of areas. In particular, I would like to highlight in this debate that we have managed, in this very difficult budgetary climate, to put more money into indigenous higher education, and I welcome the support on all sides for those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come lastly to the rationalisation and restructuring program that is dealt with in this bill. It has been presented by some as some sort of sweetener that the government dreamt up after the changes it made last year. Clearly, it has been presented as that by people who either wanted to deceive or could not be bothered reading last year's budget documents, because we indicated in the very beginning that we would be looking to a rationalisation and restructuring package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you encourage more freedom in universities, when you encourage more choice, when you encourage change, when you give more flexibility to universities, there is going to be some change. If you are a larger university or a larger corporation with greater wealth, obviously you can withstand change financially more than others can, and we recognised that from the very beginning. Change can be expensive, and people who need to accommodate it but who do not have as great a resource as others may need assistance. So we indicated in the very beginning&mdash;this is not some last-minute budget suggestion for this year; we indicated this last year&mdash;that we would be putting forward such a package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have committed $26 million over the next four years to fund this program. It is being funded to assist higher education institutions to reposition themselves through the rationalisation of courses and infrastructure. We want that to be happening. We do not want every university to try to be the same as everyone next door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program will help universities achieve long&hyphen;term efficiencies and enhance the effectiveness of the provision of higher education. That is what this is for. It is an important part of the government's commitment to regional communities. They are the universities that do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have the same resources as the big metropolitan universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, regional universities are a very vital part of Australia's higher education system, and they highlight the differences that there are. How stupid was it to say that we have a unified national system and to pretend that a small regional university would be the same as a large metropolitan one. It was just crazy from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten of the 36 publicly funded universities in Australia are located in regional and rural areas. Some of these institutions are, understandably, amongst the smallest universities in Australia, but all of them are as important to us as the biggest. That is very important to repeat: they are amongst the smallest, but they are as important as the biggest. When you realise that the theme for our education policy and direction is freedom, diversity and choice, you will understand that we are very keen to ensure that diversity in the sector is promoted and protected, and that means the small are as valuable to us as the big.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory University, for example, is a vital part of the economic infrastructure of the Northern Territory. Without it, access to benefits of higher education would be severely restricted. University campuses are a vital part of the life of other regional communities like Launceston, Lismore, Dubbo and Ballarat. In these regional areas, university campuses improve access to higher education. A campus in a regional town can, in fact, increase interest. Simply having it there can increase interest in university study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds from this bill will allow projects which can strengthen the viability of small regional institutions. You only need to speak to Shane Stone or Minister Adamson in the Northern Territory to see how strongly they would urge the federal government to implement this scheme because they realise the vital part that the Northern Territory University plays in the Northern Territory. I would not say that you are sick of the representations from them, but sometimes a point is made and it does not need to be repeated. That is fair enough. The people from the Northern Territory always argue their case strongly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5759">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The investment that the Commonwealth makes to these communities does, in fact, flow on to the economy of the regions. As has been recognised by a recent report to the West committee, all studies suggest that the activities of regional universities produce significant increases in regional economic activity. This government recognises how important universities are to regional communities. Through this program, we are standing by these communities to ensure that they continue to have access to higher education. We are safeguarding access to higher education for regional Australia. Universities which are less able to finance restructuring from their own resources will be given priority under this program. This includes the small to medium sized higher education institutions that are located outside state capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing more I want to say other than to simply repeat: universities have more money this year than they had last year. The cuts were to their plans for future funding, not to the money they have this year. They will end up with a bit less in total in a couple of years time, but the important point is that operating grant funding per student has effectively been maintained at 1995-96 levels, which is good news for higher education. That is, of course, recognised by students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why, even though we are providing more government funded undergraduate places this year, we have trimmed the number of postgraduate courses we are prepared to pay for, but we are providing more government funded undergraduate places this year than last year, and we will provide more again next year. Despite that increase in the number of government funded undergraduate places&mdash;that is, HECS places&mdash;universities have overenrolled. That tells you that students around Australia, young Australians, understand that higher education is a very good investment under this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, which we are considering, seeks to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. The government has introduced this bill in response to what is known as the CUB, Carlton and United Breweries, sub ZERO case. CUB challenged the Customs Service declaration that sub ZERO was a spirituous beverage for the purposes of sub&hyphen;item 2(H) of the tariff act schedule. CUB was successful at both the AAT and the subsequent Federal Court appeal which held that sub ZERO was not a spirituous beverage and therefore was not subject to excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to reverse the Federal Court decision and make such beverages subject to excise, effective from 3 February 1996, by removing the term `spirituous beverages' from the schedule and ensuring that the liability to pay excise is imposed upon all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, except fortified wine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this bill is that in the government's usual ad hoc sloppiness when it comes to tax related legislation they have created an anomaly within what are known as the P5 food standard categories under which these designer drinks fall. This anomaly is created due to the fact that, while designer drinks that are made from a distilled alcohol base&mdash;they are also known as RTDs&mdash;will be subject to excise, those made from a fermented alcohol base will not.</PARA>

The economics legislation committee has conducted some hearings into this, and I would like to acknowledge the work of my Senate colleague Senator Hogg, who was involved in those hearings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would the government want to pursue a bill that will actively encourage product substitution and therefore the legal avoidance of excise tax and as a consequence a multimillion dollar loss to government revenue? This highlights the farce that this bill represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is rapidly demonstrating what a joke it is when it comes to farcical legislation. We have had the  government maintain a charade for many months that the new $1.4 billion supertax was in fact a surcharge and not a tax. In the recent context of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5761"> the goods and services tax debate, we have had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) refer to his concept of a GST as a BBIT. I notice he was very careful on this occasion to avoid using the description: a goods and services surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have error upon error, mistake upon mistake, when we get down to the application of this new tax&mdash;this is in respect to the new superannuation tax. Due to its failure and incompetence, the government cannot even collect tax from the defined benefits schemes, yet they now parade around as the party of efficient and fair tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to demonstrate its tax reform credentials, here is a golden opportunity on a very basic piece of legislation to show those credentials, but I doubt that the government will take the opportunity, as so far it has not demonstrated any propensity to do so in any way, shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Senator Campbell, who is handling this legislation for the government, has read the economics legislation committee report. He was not in here when I referred to it earlier, but he should examine the analysis of my colleague Senator Hogg&mdash;who, as I said, did an excellent job at that committee&mdash;and also particularly the recommendation of the committee chair, Senator Ferguson, who did draw attention to the problems with this particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to the social consequences of this bill. At a time when there is increasing community concern regarding both alcohol and drug abuse, particularly by young people, this bill in its present form is socially irresponsible when it comes to encouraging moderate alcohol consumption by young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the University of New South Wales in its submission outlined three principal concerns relating to the bill. Firstly, the bill would see high alcohol content RTDs produced from a non&hyphen;excisable alcohol base from which no excise will be paid, while low strength RTDs produced from a distilled alcohol base will be subject to excise duty at the same rate that applies to full strength spirits.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, from a health perspective, all RTDs should be taxed in accordance with the alcohol content so as to encourage moderate and responsible alcohol consumption. Thirdly, the bill does not establish a taxation system whereby a progressive excise is levied upon all P5 beverages in accordance with their increasing alcohol content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These three concerns basically encapsulate all that is wrong with this legislation. From a social perspective, it is manifestly irresponsible of the government to be promoting the consumption of high alcohol excise&hyphen;free RTDs compared to low alcohol excisable RTDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill ensures that young people, who are very price sensitive, will choose the cheaper, high alcohol product as against the more expensive low alcohol product. This is an absolutely ludicrous position and a recipe for disaster, as the community struggles to confront the all too common problem of binge drinking and general alcohol and drug abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that this government would be doing everything in its power to ensure that young Australians are encouraged to drink alcohol in moderation rather than in excess. Yet when presented with the opportunity to do something socially responsible as well as be consistent in terms of tax treatment of light alcoholic beverages, the government presents the Senate with a bill full of anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The anomalies are, firstly, that it is detrimental to government revenue; secondly, it actively encourages product substitution to avoid the excise tax; thirdly, it makes higher alcohol products much cheaper than low alcohol products. By inference, this has been criticised by the government's own chair of the committee which inquired into the bill, Senator Ferguson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has all these faults and the government presents it to the Senate expecting it to be passed in the interests of good public policy. If this is the best the government can do under the pretext of correcting a taxation anomaly in the excise tax regime, I cannot wait to see the outcome of the Prime Minister's secret tax reform task force.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5762">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government cannot even get it right on the basic taxation of RTD products in the P5 food standard, what hope have we got? What faith should the Australian people have in the government overhauling the Australian taxation system and Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations? The mind boggles as to what the Prime Minister's secret tax reform task force is going to come up with based on the legislation we have before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of amendments before the Senate regarding this bill. The Greens, I believe, have circulated an amendment which will close the anomaly that the government refuses to acknowledge even exists. From my understanding, the amendment will introduce a two&hyphen;tier excise taxation regime so that any product classified under the P5 food standard that has an alcohol content of five per cent by volume or less, regardless of the alcohol source&mdash;be it from fermentation or a distillation process&mdash;will attract the same excise at the rate of $15.89 per litre of alcohol. Products which have an alcohol content of greater than five per cent by volume will attract excise at the rate of $31.59, when mixed with brandy, and $36.99, when mixed without brandy, per litre of alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor considers this proposal to be eminently sensible. Frankly, I am surprised that the government has left the Greens, hopefully the Democrats, Senator Harradine and Labor to clean up their mess. This measure will, in effect, see the introduction of a progressive taxation regime based upon alcohol content as opposed to being based upon the production source of the alcohol. Consequently, less excise will be paid on lower alcohol products than on higher alcohol products. Labor believes this is an entirely appropriate approach to the problem at hand. It also demonstrates a degree of social responsibility which the government was either unwilling or unable to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment before the Senate is a Democrat proposal, a simple amendment which will remove the proposed retrospectivity from the bill and make the commencement date 3 February 1997 instead of 3 February 1996. The opposition is sympathetic to the intention of the Democrats and to why they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have moved this amendment. However, the opposition will not be supporting it for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not support retrospective legislation lightly and the government should not take this as a sign that the opposition will support retrospective legislation as a matter of course&mdash;far from it. Retrospective legislation should always be used rarely and should be the exception rather than the norm. The reason why Labor has chosen to support the retrospective approach contained in this bill is that simply not to do so would mean a windfall gain to RTD manufacturers of $12.6 million. So they would be able to claim back the excise which they have already paid based upon the sub ZERO ruling. It is not that different in principle, frankly, from the other problems we are faced with as a result of the recent High Court decision with respect to state licensing fees, which I understand we will be considering, perhaps this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that this money does not belong to the manufacturers; it belongs to the consumers. As the manufacturers have no practical means by which to return this money to their rightful owners, we unfortunately are left in the position of supporting the best of two bad options which will see the government retain the excise it has already collected. This being said, we would hope that what is now in effect a windfall gain from the government of $12.6 million will be put to good use, to help restore in some manner some of the programs that the government has savagely cut in the last two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest the government look in this context at employment generation programs, which this government seems to have taken delight in cutting, thus helping ensure that unemployment&mdash;which remains an intractable problem to which this government has no answers or solutions&mdash;is at least addressed with respect to this windfall gain of $12.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other possible use for the $12.6 million would be for the government to devote it to drug abuse programs. We think it entirely appropriate, given the current debate on drug abuse&mdash;alcohol is a drug, albeit a legal drug that should be used responsibly&mdash;that drug 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5763"> abuse is another very important and socially desirable alternative area to which the $12.6 million windfall gain which the government will obtain from the opposition's support of retrospective legislation could be devoted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I would like to say is just how disappointed I am with the way in which the government has dealt with the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . As soon as I had the opportunity to examine the bill, I noted a number of problems. I immediately referred it to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Looking back, I am very glad I did so. Once again, the Senate Economics Committee secretariat did a first&hyphen;rate job. The quality and objectivity they bring to their task is always extremely helpful to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Submissions to the committee and witnesses at the public hearing on 30 May 1997 identified numerous problems, problems which could have been fixed prior to tabling of the bill in the Senate and, even more to the point, prior to this very debate. Unfortunately, the political will to do so was missing and remains missing. I fear the shadow of macho Treasury intransigence when we need the substance of practical pragmatic commonsense. Fortunately, the minor parties and the opposition and, in this particular bill, my colleague Senator Margetts, have not lacked the political will to attempt to repair the government's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quickly run through what I think are the key problems with this bill. The first is the issue of retrospectivity. The bill makes the changes effective from 3 February 1996, yet the changes were announced in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 3 February 1997, which was the day they were made effective by the excise tariff proposal No. 1 of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government seeking to backdate the changes? Such backdating offends every principle concerning unjust and unjustified retrospectivity that the Senate holds dear. The answer is simple: the government wants to retain revenue that it has already collected. The problem stems from the fact that the collection of this revenue was not in accord 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance with the law of the day as interpreted by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 when Carlton and United Breweries commenced manufacture of sub ZERO, they argued that it was not excisable. The Australian Customs Service disagreed and imposed an excise. Not surprisingly, CUB appealed the ruling with the AAT&mdash;the Administrative Appeals Tribunal&mdash;and were vindicated. As a consequence, the government returned the excise moneys collected from CUB for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs, however, have ignored the implications of the AAT decision and continued to impose excise duty on all other similar low alcohol beverages. In the meantime, they appealed this decision with the Federal Court and lost. The government is now refusing to accept the implication of decisions by both the AAT and the Federal Court; namely, that the excise was not dutiable on such beverages under the law at the time. It is insisting that its interpretation of the law was correct and not the interpretation of the AAT or the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is insisting that, by backdating the law to 3 February 1996, it is simply clarifying what it believes was the status quo on that date. It seems to me that the Federal Court has already clarified what was the status quo on that date. In fact, it cannot really be argued that excise was payable until 3 February 1997, when the government changed the law with its announcement. It is a longstanding principle of the Senate that it will generally accept changes the government makes to the collection of revenue from the date of the announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is no surprise that the government does not want to hand back the $12.6 million it has collected retrospectively in this manner. The government has sought to add moral persuasion by saying that, if it handed this money back, it would represent a windfall gain to the industry because it is unlikely to be passed on to the consumers of the product. It is true that it would be unlikely to be passed on to consumers. Such taxation returns, Senator Sherry, never are. Governments are unable&mdash;and the industries which receive the excise returns are unable&mdash;to pass them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5764"> back to each individual consumer. It is a nonsense to think they could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the money should go to the person who was legally entitled to it at the time, which is the company. That person is the manufacturer who has paid the money under protest and who has been vindicated by both the AAT and the Federal Court. If the money is retained by the government, it will constitute a windfall gain to the government since the government is not legally entitled to those moneys, unless, of course, we pass this bill unamended and change the law retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the industry has not made much fuss about this issue, I do not think it should be ignored. Organisations such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Council of Australia have pointed out the dangers. They argue that it sets a very unpalatable precedent by effectively leaving the interpretation of law to public sector officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those officials are not, with great respect and regard for their other abilities, renowned for their fight for civil rights, for personal liberties or for justice; the parliament and the courts are. There is no point challenging a ruling or interpretation by Customs officials in a court of law knowing that, if you win, the executive government and their like-minded bureaucrats will override it by means of retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retrospectivity is warranted if rorting, fraud or illegality were involved. In this case there is no suggestion of this at all, nor is it the case that large revenue losses are involved. Handing back the $12.6 million which the government is not entitled to will not result in serious repercussions for Australia's exchequer or its economy. For this reason, I will be moving an amendment to make changes effective from 3 February 1997, which is the day they were brought into effect by the excise tariff proposal and the day they were notified in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. I note, however, that I am likely to lose that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I would like to raise is that of substitutability and associated concerns. As the bill stands, it fails to rectify a tax anomaly which is perpetuating the growth in designer drinks which do not incur any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> excise duty. The taxation of beverages in the P5 category is anomalous. I feel the government should use the opportunity afforded by this bill to rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, while acknowledging the anomaly, is refusing to rectify the situation. It simply wants to ensure that the proportion of a beverage comprised of distilled alcohol be made subject to excise. It wants to do so even though it will provide a competitive advantage in terms of excise duties for ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products containing fermented alcohol as distinct from distilled alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence has been produced showing that many drinks of this type already on the market are imported from New Zealand, giving them a further competitive advantage which detrimentally impacts on our balance of trade. Moreover, domestic manufacturers, such as Bundaberg Distillers, who are competing in the same market will be encouraged to substitute foreign fermented alcohol for distilled alcohol from Australia in so-called ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink or premixed beverages&mdash;for example, rum and cola&mdash;in order to minimise tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bundaberg Distillers have also indicated that, as they do not have brewing facilities at their plant, they would be encouraged to import fermented products from overseas. In time this will have a negative impact on Australian investment. In the long run this will result in significant revenue losses. It has been estimated that the Commonwealth could face a revenue loss of about $30 million over the next three years if substitution occurs. I have been unable to understand why the government is happy to see this happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is a government which has yet again lost sight of the long run and focused on the short run. Decisions to abolish bounty assistance for the computer, book, machine tools and robotics industries, decisions to reduce the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, and decisions to wind back the export market development grants programs are all examples of short run decisions. The Democrats told the government it was wrong and industry tells the government it is wrong, but that macho intransigence prevails.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5765">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those were the decisions to ensure that, in the short run, budget savings would be improved. The fact that in the long run they will have the opposite effect has been of little concern to this government. So it is not surprising to see the same short-sighted approach being adopted yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I would like to stress that, if the bill goes through unamended, it will also fail to impose an incentive to produce lower alcohol beverages. This issue is of significant concern to health and community organisations, a number of whom made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry on this point. Health and community organisations share the above concern because they want drinks taxed progressively in accordance with their level of alcohol and not in accordance with the method of production. They see this as being important from a health perspective because it encourages moderate and responsible alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of New South Wales has suggested the bill be amended so that a progressive excise is levied upon all P5 beverages in accordance with their alcohol content. This is a position shared by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia. In the majority report of the Senate committee inquiry into this bill, government senators acknowledged the relevance of the concerns raised by industry and community organisations and the potential adverse social and economic consequences. Yet they did not recommend that the bill be amended to rectify identified problems. Instead, the majority of the committee recommended the bill be passed unamended and that a further inquiry take place. In other words, they toed the Treasury line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats see no reason for these matters to be the subject of an identical repeat inquiry. This would simply be a waste of time and resources. Moreover, it would be unfair to witnesses and those who made submissions and it would also be unfair to subject industry to unnecessary delays and uncertainties in resolving acknowledged concerns. I also regret that valuable Senate time will be wasted needlessly today. I have been forced to speak out on this bill because of the ap 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proach the government has taken. Had they tabled a bill which was properly thought through this would not be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Democrats support the specific measures of the bill, with the exclusion of retrospectivity, we want the anomalies in the excise regime rectified. The amendment of the WA Greens attempts to do this with regard to category P5. I have encouraged the government to do the necessary groundwork and extended an offer for dialogue. Despite the much better attitude of the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Senator Ellison) they have collectively decided to bury their heads in the sand, in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, my colleague Senator Margetts has done the government's work for them. She has devised an amendment which seems to resolve a number of the problems I have raised. It also has the approval of industry and community and health organisations. For this reason, I will be supporting the amendment to be moved by the WA Greens. I will also move an amendment to remove the retrospective provisions of the bill, which I hope will win the support of the Senate after senators have heard my arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been my view that this bill concerns practical matters and should have been resolved by the government. It is a sad reflection on this government when minor parties in the Senate, operating with minimal resources, are forced to do the corrective legislation which should have been quite possible for the government and for a major government department to do, especially after the very helpful work done by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and its witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I will read to the Senate a letter I wrote to the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs on 25 July 1997. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major issue here is the fact that so&hyphen;called designer drinks currently pay no excise. This is because they fall outside the definitions designed to put different excise rates on different sorts of drinks. These designer drinks are a new phenomenon, developed in part precisely because they fell through the cracks of the excise regime. They are also ways for brewers, primarily of beer, to utilise surplus capacity and alcohol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As drinks, they have been something of a worry to the health community and those social agencies with a focus on young people. This is because, unlike traditional drinks, these alcoholic drinks emulate common non&hyphen;alcoholic soft drinks&mdash;drinks consumed by children. They are effectively alcoholic lemonade, alcoholic cola and alcoholic soda water. Not only are they alcoholic, many are actually very strong&mdash;substantially stronger than beer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The marketing of these drinks, such as sub ZERO and XLR8, has definitely been targeted at youth, and female drinkers have been especially well attended to. In short, there is a major marketing effort to develop a new class of drinkers in the 18 to 25 age group. Given the problems of alcoholism and the particular success companies have had in promoting drinking and smoking to women, it is socially problematic. It is more so because of the association with kids drinks and the tendency to think of them in similar ways and knock down quite a few of these potent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drinks, which are usually bought by the bottle rather than by the glass as a standard drink. I do not wish to penalise these drinks especially heavily but it is clearly time to stop favouring them by allowing them to escape tax treatment. My amendment would assure that they are taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary issue in relation to the tax treatment of these drinks under the excise act is that they fit no clearly defined category. They are an industrial product rather than a product of a traditional pre&hyphen;industrial process such as brewing, wine making or the making of spirits and liquors. They fundamentally just get ethanol, either distilled or fermented in some combination, and whack it into a carbonated soft drink or fruit juice. It need not be sourced from grains, hops, grapes, honey or anything specific. Other drinks are defined by the source of the alcohol and the process used to make the drink. The ethyl alcohol in designer drinks could conceivably be produced chemically or from sawdust using genetically modified bacteria&mdash;doesn't that sound yummy. The manufacturers will use whatever is cheapest and if one source is taxed and another not, that may determine the source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that it has been the intention of government to tax alcoholic drinks produced for sale on the open market. Government has even gone after home brewed drinks when home brews started to be sold in shops as a number of recipes, with the materials and facilities for brewing it. This was taken as a commercial operation and a tax applied. It was never the intention of government to create a special category of tax exempt designer drinks. I think that has been clear from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government decided, perhaps unwisely, that it did not need to create a new class of drinks to apply excise to the new designer drinks. It announced that they fit in the current classification as a spirit. Clearly they have little relation to spirits as the community instinctively define them: very strong alcoholic drinks distilled from natural plant products. Admittedly, the process of spirit manufacture now bears more resemblance to chemical processes than to traditionally produced goods.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5767">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Bacardi is known in the Caribbean as `rum industrial'. It is something made chemically from refined sugar. Real rum is `rum agricol'. It is made from mashed sugar cane and, like good wine, partakes of the minerals and trace elements found in the soil, and the growing conditions. Apparently connoisseurs can tell by taste what side of what island a rum comes from. Industrial rum or whisky, or whatever, does not have such qualities. It is a strong alcoholic drink, typically around 30 per cent alcohol, made by distillation of fermented plant mash. I am not a rum drinker, but I have heard these distinctions made loudly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is indicative of what has happened and is happening in the industry. I understand Australian rums are usually more like rum agricol than like industrial rum. These new drinks are nothing like traditional spirits. They are made from alcohol produced in one way or another, and the alcohol is then taken and whacked into lemonade, fruit juice, soda water or cola. They are an entirely fabricated product, which is where the government came unstuck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predictably, the designer drink manufacturers appealed against the government, claiming&mdash;in my opinion, correctly&mdash;that these drinks were not spirits. The judges found for the designer drinks and against the government. The government then tried to redefine `spirits' to catch the designer drinks. It moved away from the definition which was instinctive and culturally understood&mdash;the common&hyphen;use interpretation of the term. It tried to say that a spirit is anything containing distilled alcohol. The designer drink manufacturers immediately converted to using fermented alcohol. It does not matter where their alcohol comes from; it is not a natural outcome of a natural process relating to what gives the drink flavour. It is usually simply a blank bland alcohol which is added to a drink. The source only matters in commercial economic terms. For the drink, it makes no substantial difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of retrospectivity&mdash;this relates to Senator Murray's amendments&mdash;it is my view that this is a case where it was the clear intention of government to tax these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drinks. They did in fact impose such a tax. This was challenged, and a legal loophole was found after the government was taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I do not think closing this loophole from the point it was legally created fits the same category as retrospectively applying a new measure. I do not accept the arguments about retrospectivity in this particular case. I think the issue is about how to successfully tax these drinks. Nevertheless, in my first amendment, I set the commencement for the new P5 based classification at the time of royal assent. It is clearly prospective, not retrospective. I have also noted Senator Sherry's comments in relation to the issue of retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason such drinks should not be taxed. It is entirely consistent and equitable. These are commercial and highly competitive products. They should not continue to get a major tax break unavailable to their competitors. Within the Excise Act there are discriminations parliament has seen fit to apply. Beer, cider and wine are taxed at a lower rate than spirits. In part, this reflects the social desirability of discouraging the drinking of strong liquor. Wine is treated differently from beer. This reflects the differences in production, employment and return to local economies. It reflects a difference in industry profiles and economic outcomes. There is some special treatment for traditional drinks with very small markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no special case to make designer drinks tax exempt. They are industrial commercial products. They are alcoholic drinks. They are products intended for a mass market. Their industry profile is similar to that of beer. They are a particular social problem to the extent that they encourage binge drinking of high strength drinks by young people. There is no reason to exempt them and significant reason to include them at a fairly high relative rate of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the government intended to tax these drinks, thought it had a mechanism to tax them and announced that they owed tax. Tax was paid. Subsequently, a judicial case decided that there was a loophole and that, under the letter of the law, these drinks were not taxable under the existing legislation. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5768"> is not a conclusion that they should not be taxed or that the government was wrong in its intention. It was wrong in the letter of the law that it used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government is now trying to rewrite the law and make an ineffective classification effective. It has already failed in this. When the government announced its new measure to catch these drinks in the tax net, the manufacturers simply changed the process. The government measure will generate no revenue from designer drinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am tired of this designer drinks issue. A couple of years ago there was a clear consensus on how to tax them: through the use of the P5 food standard on drinks. It is clear and unambiguous and catches any commercial alcoholic drink not in another category. It does not matter what industrial process they use; they will be taxed. It will create stability and a measure of predicability in the market. I think it will be a welcome relief not to have to continually rejig production to take advantage of vagaries in the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments I will put contain a simple two&hyphen;tier approach to taxing designer drinks. It is a model that got the basic approval of the committee looking at this bill. It would certainly catch these drinks, and it could be administered. It does not affect any of the current classifications. I am not suggesting changing all classifications; I am suggesting creating a new classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as creating a classification that could be applied to designer drinks regardless of the process, my model has the advantage of being a two tier system based on alcohol content. The lower tier&mdash;for drinks with less than five per cent alcohol&mdash;is set at the beer rate. This is because such drinks are equivalent to beer, both in manufacture and in their alcohol content. They are probably direct competitors with beer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Primarily as a health measure, however, drinks with an alcohol content above five per cent would be taxed at the spirit rate. They are not classed as spirits, but they are taxed at the same rate per unit of alcohol content. Hopefully, it will be a major disincentive to high strength alcoholic pop, and an incentive to keep alcohol content below five per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Most mass market beers and ciders are less than five per cent alcohol. This market measure was supported by various health agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an issue the Greens will be spending a great deal of time on because we cannot. It is not a political issue from our perspective; it is an issue of simple commonsense and one that will protect government revenue. It is also an issue that will benefit the community both through providing revenue and reducing problematic alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is really not much more to say on this measure. Most players in the drink industry support this as a means of finally determining what will happen. The alternative is to refuse this amendment and to try yet another measure next year. It is likely to be another different measure, whether or not it is as effective, because it would look too stupid to reject this and then bring it back next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no agenda other than to resolve this and a belief that the P5 standard is the method for clear resolution. While I think the two&hyphen;tiered rate system is good on social and health grounds, I am not tied to any particular rate of tax nor to any particular commencement date. I think the level and timing of tax applied is far less of an issue than that some category be developed to allow this class of drinks to have excise applied. I would like to see this issue resolved. I do hope that our amendments will be passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is serious about being fair and fair&hyphen;minded in this issue, then the first thing it should do is concede that the proposition that is being put forward by the Greens is, in effect, a fair solution to the problem that we are presented with today. The fact is that equity in its greatest sense would dictate that the amendments of the Greens should be passed and passed overwhelmingly by this chamber so that we can get rid of this curse once and for all. There is no doubt that it is an anomaly that is now starting to hang around like a bad smell and should be disposed of as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of the argument addressed by this piece of legislation is: is alcohol alcohol? The fact is that alcohol is alcohol, and I will go into that later on in this debate. What is of concern in this piece of legislation is not the fact that it is alcohol but the source of the alcohol, and the source of the alcohol being either fermented alcohol or distilled alcohol. Of course, the particular concern for the producers in Queensland is that they are primarily involved in the production of distilled alcohol. They are not primarily involved in the use of fermented alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the evolution of this total argument, the brewers of beer and the like from fermented products found that they had an excess of alcohol to their needs and wanted to use that excess of alcohol in some other means of production. Thereby came about the P5 ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products that we now see on the market. At the same time we had the distillers producing ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products by way of a different process and this attracted an excise. In effect, we had two drinks which were ostensibly the same in terms of alcohol and alcohol content but they were being taxed under a different tax regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, substantial evidence was given at a hearing of the Economics Legislation Committee which I believe unequivocally supported the fact that there should be a fair regime in the way in which P5s are taxed. Whilst the report of that committee does not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> show unanimity&mdash;there was a minority report by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats&mdash;nonetheless the government should take cognisance of the weight of the evidence that came before that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look, firstly, at the cost to the industry, particularly in Queensland. It was pointed out that Bundaberg, which is the focus of this industry in Queensland, will suffer badly. Bundaberg is already a region which suffers badly from unemployment. By proceeding with this bill, the government will do nothing more than exacerbate the unemployment situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was clearly spelt out by Dr Muller, who was appearing for the Bundaberg Distilling Company&mdash;he is also the chairman of the District Tourism and Development Board. At page 75 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would point out that Bundaberg currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. The Wide Bay region is recognised as being one of the most economically deprived areas in Australia, currently with an unemployment rate of 17.2 per cent, compared with the national average of 9.8 per cent. We believe that any impact whatsoever on local economic activity can only be of serious detriment to our region.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Muller was very much of the view that the action being taken by this government would do nothing more than add another blow to the unemployment problems that currently exist in the Bundaberg region. Further on in the hearing that day we heard other instances of the economic effects spelt out. Mr Woodward, the Director and General Manager, Business Development, Bundaberg Sugar Ltd, and the Director of Bundaberg Distilling Company, said&mdash;and this shows the impact of what the government is doing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as an indication, sales of molasses to Bundaberg Distilling amount to $1&half; million to $2 million in the current year. We know that there is going to be a knock&hyphen;on effect if the bill, as proposed, goes through.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality is that if this bill goes through then the production of distilled alcohol into ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products will cease or will more likely go offshore. So we have a direct economic impact on the Bundaberg area. But it is interesting that Mr Woodward goes on to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5770"> say at page 78 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of the legislation committee meeting of 30 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Southern Sugar Manufactures is an association of about five or six different sugar milling companies, which includes the Sugar Milling Cooperative in northern New South Wales, ICIS Sugar Milling Cooperative, Maryborough Sugar, Rocky Point, which is privately owned, and ourselves. That association can see that the knock&hyphen;on effect of this can potentially impact on the molasses sales in the region. They have thought so strongly of the issue that they have written to the committee as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not just something isolated to one particular company. There are broader interests in the outcome of this particular piece of legislation. Then Mr Woodward went on to sum up&mdash;and I think this is the real crux of the whole argument. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summing up, both for Bundaberg Rum and Bundaberg Sugar, in particular, but also the other sugar millers and Bundaberg tourism, our message is pretty clear: fix up the tax anomaly and don't put into law an incentive for the production of low tax hybrid products.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that really spells out what the government have missed on this occasion: they have an anomaly, they have to fix the problem up and what they are doing is not addressing the problem. The issue is that you have two different types of ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products that are going to end up being taxed at a different tax regime. All this will do is severely impact on an area that is already the subject of quite difficult problems in terms of unemployment in that region of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me there is no debate about the fact that alcohol is alcohol in this case. We also had medical evidence before the committee on 30 May which clearly showed that it was a sound proposal to have the sort of regime that is being advocated by the Greens as a taxing regime for these P5 drinks. There is no doubt about that at all. They supported the concept that we had in the P5 drinks a measurable quantity of alcohol and people were therefore getting, if one could say in crudest terms, a prescribed dose of alcohol. There was no mixing and matching; there was a prescribed dose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can accept the Greens amendment, that will give us two regimes of taxation and those two regimes of taxation will see that we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> end up with a fair system by which the two different forms of drinks are taxed. More importantly, I think we must accept that this is a responsible approach being taken in terms of the health of young people and others in our community if we can get a fair and equitable system of taxation for the P5 drinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing I want to make some reference to is the fact that if the government were to accept the Greens amendment they would not in any way be breaking their promise, which they generally hold so firmly to. They do not like breaking promises. They have become experts at it in the past, but this is one case where they would not break a promise to introduce a new tax on the beer and wine industries. Neither of these industries will be affected by what we see being put forward by the Greens today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is&mdash;and I will quote from what I said at page 84 of the 30 May hearing&mdash;that I believe the proposal being put forward by the Greens `quarantines the government's promise not to impose any new taxes on the wine industry, the non&hyphen;grape fruit wines and wine products. It purely quarantines it to the P5 bracket.' The fact that some people have enjoyed an advantage previously does not mean that that advantage should not now be withdrawn. Again, quoting from my comments of that day:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That seems to me to be an eminently reasonable approach to take. Of course, the anomaly that is created here is the difference between those that are fermented and those that are distilled. Of course, what we are trying to do is bring a level playing field into place otherwise, as the evidence that was put before us today shows, those that may well be distilled currently will downgrade the amount of distilled product within the product itself and go to a fermented base so that the government will lose whatever income they have counted on there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact is that the evidence which came out at that hearing showed beyond doubt that people will seek to get around whatever regime the government put in place. I do not think the approach of the government is either logical or responsible. I do not think it addresses the anomaly, and I do not think it fixes up the problems that we are confronted with. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to this last quotation because I think it really sums up what happened at the hearing. After I had made those previous comments, the chair said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just reinforce what Senator Hogg highlights. Already we are seeing ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink designer drinks being imported from overseas which fit into this category of non&hyphen;excisable and into the lower range. I think there were two or three drinks from New Zealand that they put in front of us that are already being imported, and they are made from the fermentation process. I do not think there are any of us who would like to think that there was encouragement given to allow an imported product to come in and compete directly with ours because of a differentiation in the way it was treated on a tax basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Interestingly, the parliamentary secretary who was present said, `I do not disagree with what you are saying.' So the fact is that the government are really at odds with themselves. Really, they should be embracing the approach that we have adopted&mdash;the approach to categorising the P5s as outlined in Senator Margetts's amendment. I believe that is a fair and equitable approach. It will remove some strain in the Bundaberg region. The testimony before the committee clearly outlined that people felt there would be further unemployment in that area if the government were successful in having their bill passed by this chamber. I implore the Senate to knock back the legislation as proposed by the government and to support the Greens' proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 partly because my name has been mentioned, in my capacity as Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I feel there are some matters that have been raised to which I should respond. Let me say at the outset that I do not resile from anything I said during that one&hyphen;day committee hearing. I do not think there is any senator in this chamber who would not want to do everything possible to make sure that we prevent the potential abuse of alcohol, particularly by younger people, who are those who tend to be the consumers of ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink and designer drinks. I do not think we would want to do anything that would make it more likely that they would have a cheaper form of alcohol available to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them, particularly where drinks with a higher level of alcohol are available at a cheaper price than those with a lower level of alcohol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to remember that this bill was designed specifically to close an existing loophole which had been brought about because of a High Court decision. The legislation committee inquiry heard a lot of evidence. I do not think anybody could be anything but sympathetic towards such evidence, because of the nature of the current taxation treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was said in the recommendations of the committee's majority report was that the bill should be passed now in order to close this loophole. It is a matter of remedying something which was brought about by a High Court decision, and it is an instant remedy. The issues that have been raised by Senator Sherry, Senator Hogg, Senator Margetts and Senator Murray are issues which we thought, on balance, deserved some further inquiry, because there were a whole range of issues which could not be looked at in a one&hyphen;day inquiry by a legislation committee which was dealing with one piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure there were people who would have liked to make submissions regarding what we intend to do at some stage in the future with regard to the taxation of ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink and designer drinks who did not have an input that day. In fact, the input to the inquiry was concentrated particularly on distillers and on people involved in dealing with alcohol abuse, whose evidence was very compelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to note that one of our recommendations was that the loophole should be closed immediately. That is why we wanted the bill to be passed. However, the majority report noted a number of serious concerns raised by the industry. We know those concerns are there, that they are genuine and that they do have to be addressed. But we also said that the tax treatment has social consequences. We recommended that the matter should be the subject of an immediate review by government and that the review should look at the equity of tax treatment between ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink products and designer drinks in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5772"> the P5 category, with reference particularly to three areas which I will not outline at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Greens amendment was proposed before that inquiry was held. The third part of our recommendations referred to the possibility of introducing common taxation treatment for RTD products with an alcohol content of more than five per cent, and one for those with less than five per cent. It is interesting that the Greens have amended their amendment so that it contains only those two categories. We think they are trying to do things a little too quickly. I understand why they have come up with that scheme&mdash;below five per cent and above five per cent&mdash;and I do believe it has some merit. But I am of the view that we should have more time to consider this matter and that more people should have the opportunity to have some input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hogg said he might interpret this proposal as not being a new tax, but the government might interpret it differently. We have said consistently that there will be no new taxes in this term of government.</PARA>

We did have a view of our own, which is why the report was couched in such terms, because we tried to find what we thought was a reasonable position for the government to take in light of the fact that they said their immediate concern was to close the loopholes in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with other senators, I am particularly concerned to say that I think the buying of ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink and designer drinks in a ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;use form will actually control the abuse of alcohol. It will control it in a way that might not otherwise be possible, particularly in the case of young people who mix their own drinks and who do not know how much alcohol they are mixing in their drinks. So there is a case to be made for ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and designer drinks where the amount of alcohol taken in is measured, thus avoiding situations where people mix their own drinks and put a lot of alcohol in them. As I said, this particularly affects people of a very young age. That is another important issue that we support in this very critical area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will close by saying that the committee made this recommendation because the immediate purpose of this bill is to close an existing loophole. We want to do it straight away. We think all the other measures which have been raised&mdash;some of which I have sympathy for, as senators will know from my comments at the hearing and in the report&mdash;are matters for a later stage following further input from other people and organisations.

In view of that statement, it is the government's view that any inquiry into excise on alcohol should be looked at in the context of a comprehensive tax debate. I appreciate that this is an area of some complexity. That is mirrored in the report of the Senate committee and by the differing standpoints taken by various parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not inclined to support the amendments foreshadowed by the Greens and the Australian Democrats. It is perhaps better that I go into the detail of the reasons for that opposition when we go into committee. Suffice to say that this bill, as Senator Ferguson pointed out, is designed to correct an anomaly brought about by the sub ZERO

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding the Greens' amendment, the government is of the view that, if it were to support that, it would be in breach of its undertaking not to introduce any new taxes. That undertaking was given prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the question of retrospectivity, that was dealt with by the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which, in its usual manner, looked at the subject very well and thoroughly, but the government is of the view that this bill clarifies the position in the form that people understood it to be prior to the sub ZERO decision being handed down.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will not address the Democrat amendments at length because I have covered, in my speech on the second reading, my grounds for proposing that retrospectivity apply from the date of the government's announcement and not from the date of February 1996. There are two principal reasons. Firstly, it is a Senate and a parliamentary principle not to approve retrospectivity except in instances of fraud, illegality or exceptional circumstances, and, secondly, it is a Senate and a parliamentary tradition&mdash;and a correct one&mdash;that retrospectivity in terms of revenue raising announcements should apply from the date of the announcement and not from some prior date determined by courts or any other mechanism.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may, I will draw attention to those elements which we regard as requiring attention in terms of retrospective effects. Firstly, there is the element of natural justice, where retrospective legislation offends against the principles of natural justice and trespasses upon the basic tenet of our legal system that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at the time as declared by the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area is that of uncertainty, where retrospective legislation brings uncertainty to the environment in which the community and business operate. The third area of retrospectivity concerns personal rights and liberties, where retrospective legislation has the potential to trespass unduly on the personal rights and liberties of people. The next area concerns the circumvention of recovery proceedings, where retrospective legislation defeats the judicial process by circumventing recovery proceedings to the financial disadvantage of the claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area is an unusual area for commentary in the parliament. It is the area of sovereign risk, whereby retrospective legislation raises the perception internationally of sovereign risk in Australia. Sovereign risk is the principle that laws cannot bind the sovereign, and the government, by taking a stand such as this on sovereign risk, risks being seen as irresponsible and Australia runs the risk of being seen as an unsatisfactory place to do business&mdash;in other words, you are changing the rules of the game retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to transparency, retrospective legislation is not transparency, since it is based on past liabilities. Mr Feil, representing the Institute of Chartered Accountants, argued in evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that Australia cannot create uncertainty in its legislation on a retrospective basis and continue to encourage multinational and national companies to invest in Australia. My amendment fixes all those problems, and I commend it to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

The approach Labor has taken is that there was a tax that was legal until the court ruled otherwise in the sub ZERO case. We have a lump of money collected that cannot be refunded to consumers. There will effectively be a very significant amount of money kept and retained by the producers, which is an unexpected profit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did try to do that in my speech on the second reading debate. I raised my voice, Senator Sherry, when you were speaking to your advisers&mdash;as you are now&mdash;in the attempt to attract your attention, because I did deal with that particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three issues I think you raised. The first one you did not raise explicitly. The first issue is that this is not the first time that revenue raising measures have been challenged in the courts and found not to apply and restitution has been made. If you look back at those situations&mdash;and I have not got them all in front of me, so do not ask me to itemise them&mdash;it is very seldom possible, when restitution of revenue is made, for that revenue to go all the way back to the consumers, because the consumers of products are so varied and so many that it is impossible for the company concerned to restore them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who say that that results in a $12.6 million windfall gain to the companies concerned, I say, `Yes, that is true, but it was money that never did belong to the government in the first place. Anyway, when the companies get it paid back to them, it will go straight on to their bottom line and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government will get the 46 per cent company tax,' so you are not entirely a loser on the matter. So perhaps the net effect is around $6 million. The third aspect that you relate to is the much more complex and difficult one of the High Court's decision.</PARA>

Senator Murray, I still see a particular problem with your approach, given the recent High Court decision&mdash;yes, it was the High Court&mdash;in respect of state licensing fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, the Senate will be asked to rule on the gains that have now been ruled unlawful by the High Court in respect of a tobacco distributor, I think it was, who took the case to the High Court ultimately. We will be presented with legislation that effectively prevents the states from benefiting from what has turned out to be illegal charges by states for a very, very significant number of years. That legislation&mdash;via a fairly circuitous route, but the only route legally&mdash;will ensure the Commonwealth imposes a regime of excises on those businesses in the states retrospectively. I cannot see any difference in principle between that problem we are going to be confronted with&mdash;and which Labor has given in principle support to&mdash;and the issue we are dealing with here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the reasons why we will be supporting what could be&mdash;and what you have argued is&mdash;retrospective. We see these as exceptional circumstances. I am certainly not happy and comfortable about allowing exceptional circumstances to blow out beyond reason but, having considered this and discussed it with some of the industry people, I am not even sure the industry were seeking that. As I recall my discussions, or it might have been one of the submissions, I do not think the industry were expecting a refund of the money&mdash;certainly some elements of the industry were not expecting a refund of the money. It is not as though we have a situation here where significant elements of the industry are saying, `Whoopee, we won a court case. We can grab all this money.' So I think in those circumstances Labor has taken the correct position, and we will certainly still support the government on this aspect of the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator Sherry, I understood that the refusal by the New South Wales Labor government was based on legal and financial advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That they eventually decided to refund the money was a political decision because of the community pressure for equity to be established.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 1 sets a commencement date for my amendments from the date of royal assent. Therefore, they are not retrospective. Amendment 2 states that standard P5 is the same as the Australian food standards code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I speak about these amendments, though, I want to say&mdash;despite what the government representatives have said here today, Minister&mdash;why it does not make any sense to wait until another time. My understanding from the committee was that there was not a great deal of angst being shown. There was not any indication that there was going to be a whole lot of new information being provided which would change what could otherwise be a very sensible solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is often telling the Greens and making statements in the press about what we do with time in the Senate. We have actually spent several hours on this issue in the Senate which, quite clearly, could have been avoided by a sensible approach by the government. Not only have we spent several hours trying to sort out the government's problem, but the government is suggesting that we go through the process again, not only in a committee stage in another review&mdash;which the industry do not seem to be calling for, and it is not necessarily from the community&mdash;but in the Senate. If we have to come back again to try to sort out the problem in the future, that means more hours. As 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have suggested, I can imagine that it would be too difficult for the government then to adopt the approach we have presented to try to be helpful now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you are serious about programming time, it is hard to understand how you are actually suggesting drawing out a process simply on the vague idea of not being seen to be creating new taxes when, quite clearly, we have argued that people are not suggesting that there is a new tax being created, simply a more sensible approach to the same tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 2 states that standard P5 is the same as that in the Australian food standards code. The P standard is for alcoholic beverages, and the P5 standard is for alcoholic beverages not elsewhere standardised. This excludes beer and beer products, cider wine and wine products, sparkling wine, fruit wine, vegetable wine, fortified wine, reduced alcohol wine, meads, spirits and liquors. All of these are classified in other food standards. None is covered by P5, so the use of P5 should not affect them or change the tax treatment of any of these products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But P5 will cover the new designer drinks, however made, unless they are actually redesigned to become beer or cider or spirits. In that case they will still be taxed according to their appropriate classification. The use of the P5 food standards assures that all alcoholic drinks will be subject to excise under one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5778"> classification or another. Amendment 3 basically deletes whatever P5 drinks might otherwise fall into the spirit classification. I think there is a compelling argument that all P5 drinks should be taxed at the same rate, regardless of the source of their alcohol. They are all sold in a similar way, to a similar market, and made in a similar way, and I think there is no advantage or rationale to pushing manufacturers to use fermented rather than distilled alcohol. The product will remain essentially the same in either case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 3 asserts the new P5 category. The rates of excise change from the beer rate for drinks of five per cent or less alcohol content, and at the spirits rate where there is more than five per cent alcohol. This puts higher alcohol designer drinks on par with the tax applied to mixed spirit drinks like `Bundy and Cola', all of which would be taxed at the spirits rate since they have around six per cent alcohol while the lower alcohol drinks would be taxed at the beer rate, seeing as they mainly compete with the beer market and are about the same alcohol content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It leaves open an option to the manufacturers of premixed spirits to make low alcohol variations with a level of alcohol lower than any currently available. I do not see this as an undesirable option, nor do I see their treatment as inconsistent with the rest of the act. I note that the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, in their evidence to the committee on this bill, supported our tiered approach to alcohol content on these drinks. I also note that the committee recognised that the bill will do nothing to rectify the current problem with regard to designer drinks. That is what I mentioned, with regard to Senate time, at the beginning of my presentation. I will remember this next time someone is ranting and raving about waste of Senate time. At least both minority reports suggested that something be done and my amendment was considered, and seen generally, to be on the right track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further note that, while it seems appropriate to take a tiered approach in this case based on alcohol content, our position largely reflects the fact that these are relatively synthetic manufactured products and alcohol 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> levels may vary dramatically. Traditional alcoholic drinks, however, have a nature where the alcohol content does not generally vary markedly. Spirits are taxed at a high rate because spirits are by their nature high alcohol drinks. The tax treatment of other traditional drinks reflects both alcohol content and industry or use variations. I believe this is appropriate. It is inappropriate to simply tax all drinks at the alcohol level. I commend my amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely why we indicated we are supporting the Green amendment.

There is an obvious financial incentive because the tax collected will be less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My follow&hyphen;up questions to you, Senator, are: firstly, is the government concerned or not at the potential loss of revenue by people producing, or producers producing, either the current RTDs or some new brand of RTDs based on a fermented alcohol base, and the subsequent revenue loss that will result as a flow&hyphen;on of the switching in the production base from distilled alcohol to fermented

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Sherry's question: the government is unable to predict exactly how this will develop. One has to look at the market penetration of the fermented alcohol and how successful that will be. That is really getting into the crystal ball stage. The government, therefore, cannot predict what sorts of revenue implications there would be in this and it is hard to estimate that. I am unable to answer that question because of that aspect: how do we know how the particular product will fare in the marketplace?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government is of the view that, if it were to change the regime here in relation to fermented alcohol, it would be placing itself in a position where it would be breaching its undertaking to the people of Australia that it would not bring in any new taxes, and that is an overriding principle in this case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a new tax. This excise has been there until the Federal Court decision. I will deal with your overriding principles a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, your legislation reimposes the tax on distilled alcohol. We have bottles of product made from distilled alcohol, and we have bottles of product that is not identifiably different in terms of taste or colour&mdash;the only thing that is different is the fancy name on the outside of the bottle&mdash;that is made from fermented alcohol, with the same alcoholic content. And yet what you are suggesting is that there should be a different tax treatment of those essentially the same products&mdash;only the base from which they manufactured being different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, surely you would have to accept that if producers can produce the same alcohol, the same colour, the same taste, and just vary the name on the outside of the bottle&mdash;they can even produce the same alcohol with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the same name on the outside of the bottle&mdash;I put it to you that there is an obvious incentive for a producer to switch from a distilled alcohol to a fermented alcohol base, because the taxation of fermented alcohol under what you are proposing will be less. As a consequence, the government must lose revenue. This is not just a matter of the Greens amendment for social equity and tax; it is about protection of the existing tax base. I think any logical producer listening to this who can quite easily move from distilled to fermented alcohol base would do that, because they gain financially, since they would be paying less tax. As a consequence you must collect less tax.</PARA></SPEECH>

If we tinker with one aspect of excise on alcohol, which in turn is a subset of another aspect of taxation across the whole spectrum of taxes, customs duties and excises, then I would think, Senator Margetts, that we could well be revisiting this in the debate that we are going to have on tax reform generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like having a giant canvas before you and you are just dabbing the oil on a corner of that canvas whilst the rest of it remains untouched.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can only congratulate the minister on his valiant attempt to support this legislation as a whole and to argue against the amendment that is now before us. As I see it, as a government bill it simply ensures that the proportion of a beverage that is distilled alcohol will be subject to excise. The taxation of beverages in the P5 food standard is

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we amend this legislation in the way that Senator Margetts has proposed, high alcohol content drinks based on fermented alcohol would continue to be non&hyphen;excisable and, therefore, more appealing to young people. That is my feeling about the matter, from what I have heard young people say. Senator Margetts's amendment simply seeks to base excisability on the level of the alcohol content, rather than on its derivation, whether it be manufactured by fermentation or distillation. It seems entirely sensible and logical to me, and I propose to vote for the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank and acknowledge&mdash;often we do not do this&mdash;the work done by our committees and the people who made submissions to the committees.

That committee, as usual, which was chaired by Senator Ferguson, received quite important submissions which I found very interesting. As a matter of fact, I found the material from United Distillers very useful in getting a grasp of what it was all about. I notice that Senator Jacinta Collins wrote a minority report on behalf of the opposition. I am extremely grateful to those who work on these committees&mdash;I am on some of them myself.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The politics of greed, Senator Schacht. The activities of the UN and its associate organisations represent very significant opportunities for internationally competitive firms. Each year, UN agencies contract out activities worth about $3.7 billion. I was amazed at the extent of this business when I started reading, researching and preparing for the trip. In the back of my mind I kept thinking of the potential opportunities for businesses in my own state of Victoria and for Australian businesses in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one reads through the general business guide for potential suppliers of goods and services to the United Nations it is staggering to read the vast and varied opportunities that are available for supplying UN agencies. They purchase such things as food, drugs, medical equipment, vaccines, vehicles, communication and industrial equipment, tents, Tilley lamps, hoists, computer, software and sea and air fright. If you think of a peacekeeping force, there are many things that would be required from enamel plates and cups and saucers to a mass of other items. All of these are areas in which Australian companies already work and produce and areas in which we compete well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, Australian companies won $33.7 million worth of business in UN contracts. This was a big increase compared to the $18.9 million secured in 1994. This increase really demonstrates the potential market that is waiting to be seized upon by Australian companies. It is also a testament to the increasing competitiveness of Australian companies. While I say this, there is of course scope for an improvement in these results. There is still room for many more Australian companies to become involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the value of procurement business won by Australian firms overall also increased significantly, although it must be noted that fluctuations occur from year to year. Not only was there an increase in UN contracts awarded to Australian firms, there was also an increase in World Bank disbursements to Australian companies totalling $US242 million in 1994-95 compared with $US139 million in 1993-94. Australian companies won 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contracts funded by Asian development banks totalling $US142.5 million in 1995. That compared with $US42 million in 1994. Figures do fluctuate from year to year, however they show the magnitude and the great potential for Australian businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one analyses these multicultural procurement results, it highlights the worldwide spread of Australian companies. Australian firms are looking beyond the immediate Asia-Pacific region or traditional markets for procurement opportunities. This is of specific significance in regions such as Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. While these results are encouraging for Australia and Australian firms, we need to work hard to maintain and improve them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have been concentrating on the positive figures and aspects, I cannot stress enough the importance of improving Australia's involvement. Close analysis of the figures contained in the trade and outcomes objective statement, tabled in parliament earlier this year, indicates&mdash;for example, in relation to multicultural development banks such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank&mdash;that a large proportion of the procurement business reflected only a few large commodity contracts. So even though the figures were higher it was due to a couple of large commodity contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are doing better and doing well we must maintain these figures and do better. In relation to procurement businesses, the figures in the outcomes and objectives statement show that Australia's share of procurement contracts falls behind many other countries. In 1995, Australia's share of procurement while an improvement at $US33.7 million was still around 0.8 per cent of total UN procurement contracts worth $US3.7 billion. This means that we were 20th behind other countries such as the Ukraine, Panama and the Netherlands. The top six are the US with 17.83 per cent, Italy, Croatia, the UK, France and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australia contributes nearly 1.5 per cent of the UN's regular budget on time, the government would like to see Australia's percentage of UN business continue to im 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5784"> prove significantly. Based on these figures, when we compared them to other countries, it seems very clear that there is plenty of room to raise Australia's profile amongst UN agencies as a supplier of quality goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the results I have just mentioned, the government is working hard to improve these figures and develop its trade and multilateral procurement strategy designed to help Australian companies do just that. The trade outcomes and objectives statement, which I mentioned, outlines the government's strategy. This statement for the first time sets out benchmarks of our performance on trade policy. It met a pre&hyphen;election commitment and is an important part of the coalition government's strategy to strengthen trade and foreign investment performance and to bring benefits to businesses and to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our capacity to create new jobs and our ability to raise the living standards of all Australians depends on increasing our national wealth through trade. For example, between the September quarter 1995 and the September quarter 1996, Australia's GDP rose by 3.8 per cent in real terms. About one&hyphen;quarter of this increase was provided by the growth in net exports of goods and services. Increased trade is necessary to help sustain GDP and, very importantly, as it is an issue which concerns all Australians, jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the government's trade strategy, detailed in the outcomes and objectives statement, the minister set out the high priority which the government places on our efforts to assist Australian companies in winning contracts let by UN agencies. The strategy comprises two main elements. The first, Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are active domestically in encouraging Australian companies to take up multilateral procurement opportunities. Austrade's export hotline is a valuable source of information. If you are making wheelbarrows in Ballarat or hoists in Bendigo, how do you know that the UN buys those sorts of things. That is the sort of information we have got to get across.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March last year the government established the Multilateral Procurement Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This unit reinforces the government's efforts to develop and implement its multilateral procurement strategy. The unit has engaged relevant state business bodies and produced a number of publications outlining how to go about taking advantage of multilateral procurement opportunities. The second strategy involves overseas staff from both agencies assisting in the essential task of collecting early information about project opportunities. These staff in our various Foreign Affairs and Trade missions around the world also work to establish close links with procurement officials in UN agencies and with executing agencies in borrower countries for bank financed projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am attending the United Nations General Assembly I will be meeting with the Australian staff involved in this strategy to see what is being done and to learn more about how Australian companies can get a bigger slice of the UN market, so that I can be of as much assistance as possible to Australian firms when I return to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already had extensive contact with the Committee for Melbourne. I think this is a good news story that ought to be told. The Committee for Melbourne, which was established to promote business and business opportunities in Victoria, identified the fact that Australia is not as involved in UN procurement as it possibly could be. It identified the firms in Victoria which sell products&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also a Victorian senator, Senator Schacht. I do not need your gratuitous advice. I am sure I will do it much better than you ever could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Committee for Melbourne is committed&mdash;as are we on this side of the chamber&mdash;to jobs growth, it decided that we should be getting more of that action. The committee identified a number of firms&mdash;I think it is over 200&mdash;that sell the sorts of things the United Nations buys. The commit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5785"> tee invited the businesses and procurement officers from the United Nations to a seminar so that the procurement officers could tell those businesses how they could get into the loop: how they could put in tenders, how they should put in their tenders and when the UN advertises. That was incredibly creative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what we found out after 13 years of Labor? The Committee for Melbourne asked the UN procurement officers, `Do you have a conference every year?' They said, `Yes, we do: the World Health Organisation, UNICEF.' `Where do you have them?' `All around the world&mdash;wherever we're invited.' `Have you ever been invited to Australia?' `No, we've never been invited to Australia.' So the Committee for Melbourne invited the UN procurement officers to come to Australia to give Australian firms the opportunity to find out about the sorts of things that the United Nations buys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of pro&hyphen;active creative project which will make sure that we increase employment opportunities in Australia. It will give small businesses which might not otherwise get into the loop&mdash;the company that is making wheelbarrows in Victoria, the company that is making freeze dried food in Tasmania&mdash;an opportunity to find out how they can get into the system and become part of this worldwide procurement process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Committee for Melbourne and other Australian corporations, with the support of the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and his department, were successful in securing for Melbourne the United Nations Inter&hyphen;Agency Procurement Group Meeting. This meeting will be held in Melbourne in 1999. It will be the first time this meeting has been held in Australia. I congratulate Minister Fischer and his officers and also the Committee for Melbourne for this achievement. Holding the meeting in Australia will be invaluable in promoting Australia and Australian businesses. It will build on the momentum which has already been generated through promoting Australia's involvement in UN business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope while I am at the UN to meet with procurement officers from both Washington and New York in order to make myself 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> known as a conduit and a liaison point so that when they come to the conference in 1999 there will be somebody that they know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a growing awareness among firms of the extent of the business and activities of the United Nations. It is vital that Australian businesses maximise future opportunities in the UN system. It is obvious that UN agencies are keen to diversify their sources of supply. Australian products and services are of world&hyphen;class standard. It is important that we show the UN this. It is also important that Australian companies increasingly develop links with the UN and its agencies. To do this and win contracts, our companies will have to be well informed and pro&hyphen;active.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">UN officers have indicated that there does not appear to be a high level of awareness among Australian firms of the procurement procedures followed by UN agencies. Also, many companies are not responding to invitations to bid. By doing   so they run the risk of not being asked to bid again. Companies also need to ensure that they complete their tender documents thoroughly and meet tender deadlines so that they are not disqualified at an early stage. These might sound simple matters, but they are matters that businesses must get right if Australian firms are to successfully compete for business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am at the UN I will endeavour to find out all I can about this process so that I can pass the information on to businesses in my state and in other states&mdash;as I have already done, Senator Schacht, by alerting former Senator Bronwyn Bishop to the issues that might be able to be addressed through her portfolio. I cannot stress enough to businesses in Australia that I will do the same thing for them; I will not just promote businesses in Victoria. Although involvement in multilateral procurement can mean long lead times and substantial financial commitments for Australian businesses, the rewards are potentially great.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have discussed this with the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. Its legal advice came from the legal firm Minter Ellison, which just happens 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be the legal firm which provides advice on this matter to Mr Olsen, the Premier of South Australia. When I raised that matter with the people at the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, they said that they were aware that the firm acted for both of them. They were concerned about the conflict of interest but they had spoken to the firm and the firm assured them that the lawyer dealing with advice to the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> had absolutely no connection with and was completely separated and walled off from the lawyer handling advice to Mr Olsen. Therefore, they said that they did not believe that there was any conflict of interest. I appreciate that the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> was so forthcoming in explaining that position to me during our recent telephone conversation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to the people at the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, `If it is a matter that you are concerned about on the legal advice that you have, the one thing I could do is to table all of these documents in the Australian Senate. As they are freely available to any member of the public in South Australia, I will table them in the Senate so that there can be no doubt about it, and therefore you can publish what you like and the public of South Australia can make a judgment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to table five documents. The first is dated 30 June 1997 and is from Mr Rann. It is a court document giving his side of the case. The second is dated 29 July and is from Mr Olsen, in reply. The third document is from Mr Rann, dated 20 August, further explaining his case. The fourth is a reply from Mr Olsen of 21 August. The fifth document, also from Mr Olsen, explains his position and denies Mr Rann's allegations. I seek leave of the Senate to table these documents.</PARA>

This is not a slight argy&hyphen;bargy argument across the chamber in the Senate. That is why this is a matter of such public importance in South Australia. As the case unfolds, the people of South Australia, even today, should have access to this information. I am disappointed that the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> took legal advice that said it could not publish any of the material, when three television stations in Adelaide and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> openly published details of these documents at the end of last week and in Saturday's press.</PARA>

Baker said words to the effect that he had heard that the plaintiff "had spoken to John (meaning the defendant)". Baker expressed a

Baker thereafter regularly provided information to the plaintiff on the issue of Catch Tim and political donations generally. The plaintiff by telephone submitted proposed questions to be put to Brown in the House to Baker for vetting and Baker suggested changes to those questions to improve them. Baker invited the plaintiff to focus upon the original source of the donation made to the Liberal Party through Catch Tim Limited. Baker advised the plaintiff to pursue the issue of the identity of Moriki Products in the same context as the plaintiff had pursued Brown in respect of the identity of Catch Tim Limited.

In or about later 1995 and during 1996 Foley advised the plaintiff that the defendant as the then Minister for Infrastructure was providing information to Foley in respect of a major outsourcing contract with Brown was negotiating and signed with a company known as Electronic Data Systems (EDS). Foley advised the plaintiff that the defendant had told Foley that Brown had signed the EDS deal, had been a weak negotiator, and had not secured the best possible deal for South Australia. During 1976 Foley did in Opposition strategy and  policy meetings attended by the plaintiff and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise as a matter of public interest the implications for tax and industry policy of global electronic commerce. Few Australians would argue with the need for fundamental tax reform in this country. While the emphasis may vary and the preferred tax mix may differ, the potential for emerging technologies to erode existing tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5790"> revenue is truly breathtaking&mdash;so much so that no debate on tax and industry policy can fail to address the challenges of cyberspace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put simply, if we do not find solutions to the economic imperatives of the Internet, any tax reform might well be out&hyphen; of&hyphen;date before it is implemented. These problems are not confined to Australia alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All countries are under the threat of borderless electronic commerce undermining the foundations of sales tax, capital gains tax and intellectual property as the basis for imposing withholding tax. The implications of information technology for the broader economy are profound, and the sense of urgency conveyed in the information industries task force report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The global information economy: the way ahead</EMPHASIS> should not be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's terms, harnessing the growth engines of the IT world is about competitiveness&mdash;getting the policy settings right to build infrastructure and to encourage investment. In tomorrow's terms, maximising the capacity of information technology will be about survival. The exponential growth of electronic commerce points to the reality that there is another tiger economy on our doorstep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer a vision of what was merely imaginable beyond 2000, the information superhighway is rapidly transforming the way we do things such as banking, purchasing and communicating. Doing business over the Internet was virtually unheard of just a year or two ago. Since the World Wide Web was invented in 1989, electronic commerce has grown exponentially. Based on the 1995 Internet retail sales, worldwide electronic retailing is currently valued at $US300 million. Web commerce increased by 500 per cent in 1996 and is expected to grow at 400 per cent in 1997. Industry analysts expect Net trade to reach $100 billion to $150 billion by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four factors driving growth in electronic commerce are the increase in the number of users, the high disposable incomes of typical Net users, the growing confidence in the Net as a medium for trade as the privacy and security of on-line transactions are secured and the growing convergence of electronic commerce technologies around the Net. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The most rapid growth in electronic commerce has been in business to business transactions, currently estimated at about $US1 million. According to industry sources, by the year 2000 around 20 per cent of all software will be delivered on-line as well as 20 per cent of travel bookings in Australia and upwards of 50 per cent in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The release of the Goldsworthy report is timely in promoting an understanding of what is required to facilitate Australia's transition to an on-line economy. The research undertaken by Professor Goldsworthy should not, however, be read in isolation. Its implications and subject matter reach far beyond the relevance of the PC market&mdash;incorporating business, taxation, privacy laws, industry policy and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter of most significance to business and the community is the implications of the superhighway for job creation and employment. The 1996 OECD report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Technology, productivity and job creation</EMPHASIS> identifies knowledge, especially technological knowledge, in industries such as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, new materials, environmental technologies, computers, education and software as the main sources of economic growth and job creation in member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst armed with the knowledge that the IT field represents the source of new jobs in Australia and the best chance we have of reducing unemployment, industry sources suggest that United States companies are, on average, about two years ahead of Australian companies in adapting to Net based electronic commerce. Further, the Goldsworthy report typecasts Australia as a declining player in the global IT field, representing two per cent of IT users and only 0.3 per cent of producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopping on board the IT superhighway is not just about keeping up with the Joneses, however. It is about putting Australia forward as an active participant that has the means to participate and influence the shape of the emerging global economy as opposed to being a passive spectator alongside the global IT giants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a collaborative review of the research undertaken by the Mortimer report, the Golds 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5791"> worthy report, the soon to be released Cutler report and the Australian Taxation Office Internet and electronic commerce project, we will soon be in a position to map out the way ahead for Australia's on-line economy. The treatment of electronic commerce as merely a modern day means of doing business, however, raises some serious questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamental to these questions are the implications of electronic commerce for Australia's taxation system. Firstly, the full impact of borderless electronic banking has not yet been felt. Currently, Australia's claim to taxable income is based on the residence of the taxpayer and the source of the income or gains. However, as electronic commerce further erodes national borders, creating a virtual global marketplace in cyberspace, how is a government able to identify and trace who, what and where taxable activities are occurring? Unfortunately, a Net address does not identify the user or users with the same geographical proximity as does a postal address. How realistic is it that authorities will be able to track down cyber tax evaders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the Australian tax system enshrines the principle that the source of income is located where the economic activities creating the income occur. Given the global nature of the Net, how is the source or sources of income to be determined when taxable activities have taken place in a number of different jurisdictions across cyberspace? What evidence would be required to establish a permanent connection within a particular jurisdiction? If a permanent establishment is found to exist in a particular jurisdiction, how much of the income and expenses arising from global trading activities could be attributed to this jurisdiction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, given President Clinton's recent commitment to a tax free trade zone on the Net, what technical and policy limitations will inhibit Australia from collecting taxable revenue from electronic commerce if, indeed, it were thought desirable to do so? Can the tax system of a solitary government be effective and enforceable amidst the tax shelters and hideaways of cyberspace?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, if electronic cash is analogous to paper cash, how will transactions be sourced 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and traced in the absence of intermediaries and on-site tax collectors? What audit techniques, for example, would need to be implemented to avoid perhaps rampant tax evasion? Even if there is evidence of a transaction, how will authorities determine the nature of the transaction, which is, in effect, sent in the digitised form of binary numbers, without infringing individual privacy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, within a global marketplace with no traditional legal structure, will copyright and intellectual property rights still apply? How will these rights be monitored and enforced? To what degree will these concepts be relevant when the content has been altered, manipulated or even adapted? How will a company's identity be verified? What forms of protection will be afforded to protect individual brand names from being passed off as the real thing? Assuming that these issues can be resolved, the Net presents unlimited opportunities for Australian business and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the contributions from Mortimer, Goldsworthy and Cutler, I look forward to investigating the implications of the expected growth in electronic commerce as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry. The committee will inquire and report on the impact of Internet commerce on many areas of potential effect. The committee will consider amongst its terms of references the expected growth in Internet commerce and the findings and solutions proposed by the task force on electronic commerce, which are being prepared by the Australian tax office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quantity, value and types of goods entering Australia under duty and sales tax free limits and the commercial entry thresholds will be another area that will be considered. As well, it will look at the opportunities for Commonwealth agencies to improve services to the business sector and to the general public arising from growth in Internet commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two issues which I am eager to develop during the public accounts inquiry are the benefits of electronic commerce to small to medium enterprises and ways in which the new technology can increase labour flexibili 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5792"> ty. The Net is a cheap and effective means of reaching suppliers and markets that would otherwise be closed to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest advantages of the Net for Australian small business is its ability to erode the tyranny of distance, enabling the establishment of overseas market presence without the capital costs of a physical office. The opportunities available are such that businesses and consumers are rushing to connect to the Net. In January 1997, there were 57 million Net users worldwide, of whom 1.5 million were Australian. By the year 2000, the number of users is estimated to triple to about 150 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to inform the Senate that, if recent reports are to be believed, generation T has now been born. These are the techno tots and the cyber kids who have embraced the information superhighway and envisage that the Net will be used for such diverse purposes as to e-mail Santa, to elect the US President and to become mandatory for good living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research by US futurist Thom Blischock indicates that 98 per cent of people born after 1983 have used a computer. Generation T spends an average 4.4 hours per week on the computer, 18 hours watching television and seven hours on the telephone. The enthusiasm for the new technology is not dependent, however, on age. A recent trial of PC and Net training for people over 55 was met with unprecedented demand. Perhaps there is hope for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Net makes home based work an attractive option for people with disabilities and parents who prefer to work from home. The possibilities of electronic commerce are virtually unlimited. It is clear that those countries that can quickly overcome the difficulties of ensuring security, privacy, intellectual property and revenue collection will lead the rest in terms of wealth and jobs. It is a challenge, I believe, that we all must be prepared to meet.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5792"><TITLE>Industry Policy</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to argue that Australia has progressed from a nation that survived on the price of its commodities to one that realised its manufacturing base and, today, its services industry are critical to future success. This has been as a result of significant policy changes throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. However, realising the changing nature of the Australian economy is only half of the challenge facing government. The implementation of appropriate industry policy is essential to ensuring that future success and security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Policy implementation has been a major concern in this sector. I mean two things by this. Firstly, Australia has continued to focus predominantly on an approach of utilising and promoting current comparative advantage as a way of attempting to improve Australia's trading position, our economic outlook and our long-term future. Secondly, Australia, and in particular this government, has relied and is relying on an economic policy rather than an industry policy to improve our world trading position. These two approaches have done and will do little to rectify the current problem with which Australia finds itself confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I will address the ills of focusing Australia's industry and economic policy on the notion of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is premised on the notion 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5793"> that a country's engagement and success in a market should be determined by its natural resources and skills. These resources and skills create an immediate advantage in the respective market for the nation. Unfortunately for Australia, however, our natural resources and skills lie predominantly in the area of commodities, which has for some time now been producing a diminishing return for Australia. This means that we are leading the world in areas of trade that are of declining value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact is twofold. Firstly, our return for investment is declining and, secondly, our imports increase as we outsource and buy products and skills that have been produced and provided offshore. Generally, these imports are in high growth areas, thus improving our trading partners' position at our own cost. The real success in comparative advantage will stem from creating an environment that identifies and facilities comparative advantage in long&hyphen;term, high growth industry sectors, rather than immediate comparative advantage but with little future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I will address the failure of government to formulate a strategic and integrated industry policy. After significant macro&hyphen;economic and micro&hyphen;economic reform change in the 1980s, government has continued to focus on these issues of economic policy. However, with much of that work completed successfully over the last 10 years, government now needs to address new areas of policy reform. Economic policy can no longer be a substitute for industry policy. Government is relying on fiscal control, budget surpluses, low inflation and moderate wages growth to attract investment and to provide a level of growth that will both increase employment levels and living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry policy does not rely solely on macro&hyphen;economic settings or micro&hyphen;economic reform. It actively participates in creating an environment in which industry and investment will prosper on an industry by industry basis. Economic policy can assist in creating an appropriate environment in which to conduct industry policy, but this cannot be confused with industry policy itself.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To provide a participatory environment in which industry is engaged, industry policy is based and should rely upon a number of factors. Firstly, it must be strategic. This means that government and industry leaders in partnership must devise a plan for identifying and entering high growth and high return industry sectors. There must be clear criteria in order to identify those industries that Australia wishes to be engaged in. This requires a fundamental rethink of the nature of participation in the economy. It requires government to view its citizens not solely as consumers but also as producers. This means that the community has an interest in forgoing short&hyphen;term cost reduction based upon current areas of advantage. Instead, our community relies on the creation of comparative advantage in long&hyphen;term, high growth and return industries that provide employment and security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As producers are reliant on growth for employment, it must be seen as a priority by the community to forgo short&hyphen;term consumer gain for long&hyphen;term advantage. In doing this, government is setting itself up to take advantage of a range of industries that will be long&hyphen;term producers, with increasing value. There are a range of criteria that are required for success in this selection process. These will be industries that will have a significant lifespan that will benefit Australia and Australians in the acquisition of technology, knowledge, research and development and public and private research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, these industries will exist where there is a high elasticity of demand. The desired industries should be export orientated, possibly with the government prepared to fund entry into the world market through national savings as an investment mechanism in Australia's future. The desired industries should also be value adding. This would increase the value of the export and decrease the cost of the final import where there is a direct correlation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the industry should have a high level of return. This would be true to both investors and employees who see their living standards increase as the result of success and return levels of production. Thus, the com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5794"> munity reaps the reward as producers via job security and increased wages, rather than as consumers via product cost reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be understood that a strategic policy is compatible with an integrated policy. I mentioned earlier that economic policy can assist with creating a helpful environment for industry policy. Australia cannot afford to continue past policy trends of concentrating on one aspect of a problem or providing a one dimensional solution. To this effect, industry policy is in partnership with a range of other government policies. For example, part of this integrated approach may address issues such as import replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has focused on this remedy heavily in the past. However, it did so in a vacuum. The international market is much more complex in this approach as indicated. A multifaceted approach is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of an integrated and strategic policy, import replacement can be an important tool in the formulation of a successful industry policy. A failure to address all relevant issues that impact industry can, however, result in overall failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once having identified these criteria and desired industries, the government must turn its attention to how best to implement and administer this. As previously mentioned, there are a number of immediate policy areas that can be used to assist industry growth. Tax policy, predominantly in the area of research development, stands out as an obvious choice. Such a policy allows industry to invest in areas that are identified as future long&hyphen;term growth industries. If government desires the identification of those industries, it must provide the incentive for industry involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bounties such as the ships bounty, which were vigorously supported by the ALP, is an obvious example. This policy, which in the end was supported by the government, allowed a current Australian industry leader with long&hyphen;term growth prospects to remain competitive, rather than putting it to the torch of neutral economic policy. These are, however, fundamentally areas of policy that are reactive rather than part of a strategic plan to assist industry. The initial approach to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bounty by the government and then the backflip due to electoral pressure highlight this reactive approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been two significant recent contributions to the focus government should take with regard to industry policy. The first of these was the Goldsworthy report that looked into the information economy. It made a number of recommendations regarding the role of government in this newly developing industry. Those recommendations were summarised in the following way: appointment of a cabinet minister for information industries; establishment of an industries council; a 200 per cent R&amp;D concession; feasibility studies funded by an information economy development fund; coordination between three tiers of government; outsourcing to maximise development benefits; establishment of a purpose designed attraction agency for the industry; and some taxation reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this was a report that encouraged government involvement and assistance in industry. Tom Burton explained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message from yesterday's report was clear: if the Government wants to snare a greater share of the global information industry it is going to have to pay for it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Mortimer report was of a similar opinion. This recommended: the support of successful industries; appointment of a high level investment advocate with $1 billion to sell Australia internationally; annual assessment of business assistance by parliament; and a focus on exports, investment, innovation, competitiveness and sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, these reports are on the right track. They seek to involve government in industry policy as a supporter of Australian industry. There are two concerns from these reports, however. Firstly, there may be an over reliance on the information economy which, at best, will include about 15 per cent of employment opportunities. In this sense, it may be a false hope to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is an emphasis on assistance of industry and government intervention, but no real strategic plan on how to go about this or to give effect to particular outcomes. The long&hyphen;term focus required in planning industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5795"> policy can come from one main initiative: that is through the creation of an independent investment agency. This is not a new idea. It has been used successfully around the world, predominantly in South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of that agency will depend on a number of criteria. They are: the agency must receive high levels of guaranteed government funding for a specific period of time, yet be allowed to remain independent; the agency must be wide reaching, based both on an industry and a sectorial approach; its performance must be tied to objective measurements; the primary objective must be to assist government and industry in identifying long&hyphen;term, high growth industries and to identify possible barriers of entry to the market; and it must be linked to growth targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the agency, however, is not all that is required. A great deal of trust or faith must be placed in that agency. There will be a requirement for it to fully consider the agency's recommendations based upon that agency's expertise. The proposal for such an agency is contrary to the traditional, neutral economic and industry theory subscribed to by most governments of the past. However, if Australia's position at the moment teaches us anything, it is that the classical theory subscribed to is not working. One only has to look at the tiger economies of Asia to identify the structure and system required to facilitate this long&hyphen;term growth. Clearly, then, our industry policy requires a radical rethink of the role of government, both in the role it directly plays and the way in which it facilitates involvement from other quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is encouraging to read reports that the government is considering a further change in industry policy. However, the government needs to understand that the debate is more than the level playing field versus government intervention. The policy required is that of a different paradigm. The producer versus consumer approach is required in order to be prepared to make the decisions that will bring success in the future. The creation of advantage for the future requires a much more strategic approach than current day industry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy thinking has allowed for. The policy approach must focus much less on immediate cost advantage and much more on growth sectors of the future and government's role in facilitating that growth.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5795"><TITLE>X-rated Videos</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing matters of public interest and I believe that one of the most important matters of public interest would be the credibility or otherwise of ministerial statements. I want to deal again with the very serious question of whether or not the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is the first law officer of the Crown, in a statement on 8 April of this year, relating to X&hyphen;rated videos and the NVE classification, delivered himself of a statement which is demonstrably false.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised this matter with the leader of the government in this chamber (Senator Hill) by way of a question. I refer to that question, which is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 25 August 1997. I quoted from the Attorney&hyphen;General's statement which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has decided to ban X&hyphen;rated videos and create a new category for non&hyphen;violent sexually explicit videos which will contain tighter guidelines in order to exclude demeaning material.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I asked Senator Hill whether he was aware that such material should already be excluded by law under the national classification code. Certainly the Attorney&hyphen;General should have known that. I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Does this not mean that the responsible minister, namely the first law officer of the Crown, has failed to ensure that current X&hyphen;rated material conforms to the demeaning provisions of the national classification code and that, by this statement, the Attorney&hyphen;General has misled the public since the establishment of an NVE category is clearly not necessary, as he says, `in order to exclude demeaning material'? . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Hill responded yesterday&mdash;I will not deal with his response on Monday, because it was a question without notice&mdash;after referring the matter to the Attorney&hyphen;General. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Attorney&hyphen;General has noted that the joint press release referred to must be viewed in its entirety as not only reflecting the government's decision but also providing information to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5796"> community about what the proposed new NVE category is likely to contain . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is not a non&hyphen;answer, then I don't know what is. Clearly, it is a virtual admission that the Attorney&hyphen;General did deliver himself of a public statement which is demonstrably false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the second paragraph of the statement if the government is not prepared to admit openly&mdash;although, inferentially, it has&mdash;that he was wrong. The second paragraph of the Attorney&hyphen;General's statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision fulfils the Government's commitment to ban X&hyphen;rated films and address community concerns about the availability of any sexually violent and demeaning sexually explicit material.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department admitted before a hearing of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that such material should not now be in the X category. Yet the Attorney&hyphen;General says that not only is the NVE to be established in order to do something which the minister or his officers should have done in respect of the X&hyphen;rated category, but also it is done to address community concerns about the availability of sexually violent and demeaning sexually explicit material&mdash;material that should already be excluded from the X category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders why the government has, on the recommendation of the Attorney&hyphen;General, proceeded in this way&mdash;on the basis of misinformation; on the basis of statements that are patently and provably incorrect. Because of the odium attached to the X category, Canberra's porn merchants have long sought the switch to the NVE label. In fact they welcomed the decision of the federal Attorney&hyphen;General to establish an NVE category and were able get around a clear election promise by this government to ban X&hyphen;rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint select committee on video materials received evidence that the pornography in the X category engenders in the minds of the habitual viewer a callous and manipulative orientation towards women, and a perception of women in general as highly promiscuous and available. This is the sort of material that we are dealing with. One would have thought that the Attorney&hyphen;General of this Commonwealth should state the facts. Instead, he has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misled the community. He has not misled the parliament as yet but, obviously, if one were to believe the statement, it would mislead the parliament. No doubt his colleagues have also been misled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great concern, because we are on the verge of this material going into the homes of Australians via the Internet. The technology is available, of course, and will be quite readily available in the next two years for real time videos to be shown through the Internet. This is something that should be considered very seriously by the parliament and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the question of those issues in particular, I wish to reiterate my concern that the government has not focused on the clear fact that the Attorney&hyphen;General, the first law officer of the Crown, on an important social and public issue, has delivered himself of a statement which is provably false. I ask the government to take that matter on board in order to restore the credibility of statements that emanate from ministers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where the Labor Party stands on tax reform. We know where Wayne Goss stands on tax reform and, as my colleague Senator Hill said, we know where Gareth Evans stands on tax reform. We know that Gareth Evans supports death duties but we think Kim Beazley does not support death duties. It all goes on and on. Even the Young Turks want tax reform. John Faulkner is not a Young Turk so he probably does not want tax reform. Senator Sherry is getting close to that margin and we do not think Senator Sherry wants tax reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to my answer to Senator Mackay, we can judge from history what is the Labor Party's attitude to tax. The Labor Party's attitude to tax can be summed up in two words&mdash;more tax. That is what the Labor Party stands for. That is exactly the point that Senator Hill made about Gary Evans.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor were in office they increased wholesale sales taxes, they increased petrol excises, they increased the Medicare levy, they increased the wholesale sales tax on cars, they increased company tax. There is great amusement in the Labor Party at this because the one thing you really like and really love is to increase taxes. That, I might say, is the one thing the Labor Party is good at&mdash;increasing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some real problems with the current tax system. The current tax system has real problems in relation to the  high levels of marginal tax on personal income. There are problems with the wholesale sales tax system, as anyone who has been close to this system clearly knows. What is most peculiar is that the Labor Party refuses to join in this tax debate. What we have is a scattergun approach day after day with various members of the Labor Party moving in and moving out of the tax debate as they are corrected by their leader, Kim Beazley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is very clear on its principles in relation to tax reform. We want a system which will encourage people to work, to save, to invest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I had the pleasure of opening the national women's round table which has brought nearly 50 national women's organisations to Canberra for consultations.

It also includes a delegation to meet with the Prime Minister tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous round tables have been held twice a year for one day. Labor ministers, if they appeared at all, appeared for a very brief moment and disappeared. Women's organisations are not accustomed to having the federal Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women actually stay and listen to them. That in itself is a big plus. There is a more focused effort from the round table, because of the longer time that we have. Things can be canvassed at length and in more detail with a longer round table. It does provide, as I said before, for greater interaction or networking between the round table participants and also between members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, I wrote to all women's organisations around Australia and asked them to identify, in consultation with their membership, issues which they regarded as important to women so that the agenda would reflect this and form the basis of the round table.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous employment programs have been maintained. Over 4,700 indigenous people commenced traineeships in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;compared to 800 in 1994&hyphen;95. There is one of the key differences in performance: 4,700 indigenous people on traineeships under us; 800 in 1994&hyphen;95 under the previous Labor government. A further six projects are planned to start this financial year and are expected to provide positions for up to 165 apprentices and trainees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In higher education nationally, for 1997 we have allocated $21.6 million to higher education institutions across Australia to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. In addition to that, I announced last year a further $8.8 million for the establishment of five indigenous higher education centres. These centres will encourage the development of research skills and academic excellence within the indigenous community and help to nurture and promote Australian indigenous cultural heritage. The coalition government has increased funding for indigenous education across the spectrum from preschool to higher education, but we are not satisfied with that. There is still more to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While most Australians take literacy and numeracy skills for granted, a significant number of indigenous students encounter very real difficulties. The government is aware that the Labor government failed to provide assistance to children from indigenous communities entering school who required additional assistance in English in order to function effectively in the classroom. I am very pleased to tell the Senate that I have announced today that a new program of support for these students is to be introduced next year. The Commonwealth will provide an estimated $6.2 million per annum for this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5810"> purpose under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. It will provide to indigenous students from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and communities intensive courses in standard Australian English similar to courses provided to newly arrived migrants. It will enable students commencing their schooling to do so on the same footing as other Australian students by providing government and non&hyphen;government education authorities a once&hyphen;only payment of just over $3,000 for each eligible student. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Heffernan today, relating to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak to this issue, which Senator Alston raised, commenting about my press release. What he fundamentally failed to acknowledge again, as he has now done for 12 months, is that it is his policy and his government's policy which has cut $55 million a year off the ABC budget. If that budget had not been cut, they would not have had to restructure so many of their programs and sack nearly 1,000 people. That is Senator Alston's policy. It is what we will consistently say, every chance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we get to expose the fact that he wants to blame ABC management for the changes in programming, when those changes are brought about by the cuts to the ABC that this government, in opposition, promised not to make. On election night, after they had won the election, when Senator Alston was asked, `Will you maintain funding for the triennium in real terms?' he said, `Absolutely.' Four months later, $55 million a year was taken off the ABC budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the cut to the weather reporting is on the front page of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I think most people would rather trust the remarks of Allan Humphries and David Ellyard than your long track record of broken promises regarding the ABC. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Humphries, 49, departed with both guns blazing. Yesterday he accused the ABC of "blatant urban bias".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Ultra violet readings, Sydney's dam heights, a beach watch on bluebottle stings on Bondi Beach, and pollution levels now clutter the weather slot," he said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is going because this minister cut the ABC budget. This change to the programming of the ABC weather service is because this minister and this government have broken their promise to maintain ABC funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, 1,000 jobs have gone. There has been amalgamation of programs, whether it is in radio or on television. The ABC still has not yet completed all its cuts to meet the target set by the government. We certainly know that Radio Australia has been destroyed to achieve the cuts of this government. We have already had plenty of evidence that this has reduced Australia's standing in the Asia-Pacific region. In recent times there has been evidence given that, even in South-East Asia, in such places as Cambodia, our expatriates have been put more at risk, as they said publicly to me and the ambassador in Cambodia&mdash;</PARA>

You were the ones who posed the cuts. You were the ones who got the result that we saw in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> where well-respected staff of the ABC are saying publicly their program has gone because of your cuts that the management has to impose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute hypocrisy for you to stand up and say, `It's the ABC's fault, not mine.' If you had not put the cuts on them, they would not be having to do this to their program. We certainly will expose this at every chance we get and draw it to the attention of the public through press releases, through public statements and through statements here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bourne and Senator Schacht might like to comment on the fact that the Labor government ran down the effectiveness of the Bureau of Meteorology&mdash;the people who really do give the weather reports to rural and regional as well as metropolitan Australia. They just simply let it run down. They did not provide it with the proper staffing, with the proper equipment, to provide the necessary service. Rather than Senator Schacht complaining about what the ABC might like to do&mdash;that is, the ABC in Sydney doing simply what the ABC everywhere else does&mdash;he should get his facts in order. He should address the real problem: the Labor Party's criminal neglect of the Bureau of Meteorology during their term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston has quite comprehensively destroyed any credibility Senator Schacht might have had in relation to the ABC and this particular issue. I call upon Senator Schacht to address the real problems of getting weather forecasts out. Rather than suggesting that the minister had banned the weather, he should look at the effects of his government&mdash;a government in which he was, for a short time, a minister&mdash;and the way that his government impeded the Bureau of Meteorology in their tasks and duties of providing good and accurate weather forecasts and services to all Australia. Senator Schacht's stupidity in this press release perhaps equals the stupidity of his government&mdash;the government of which he was a member&mdash;in running down the excellent work that the Bureau of Meteorology did.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That just vindicates the position I earlier stated. What we are talking about here are the cuts to the ABC and how they are being effected on the Australian community. There is no doubt in the minds of Australians what this government has done to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The manifestation of that $55 million cut this year and the cuts previously has been a significant 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduction in the services that reach Australia. The cuts do not only affect Australia. We have already heard from Senator Bourne that we are talking about how Australia communicates with the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a systematic deflection from the substance of this issue. Yes, Minister Alston, let us talk about the politics of it. Let us talk about the restrictions on drama productions by the ABC. Let us talk about the forced consolidation of services, not only in regional Australia but in metropolitan Australia as well. Let us talk about the cuts to Radio Australia and the closing down of the relay points in other places in the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take up the point about funding of the ABC and where the ABC would have gone if real funding had been maintained&mdash;as this government promised not only in the election but prior to previous budgets as well. They stood up in this place and the other place and gave a 100 per cent commitment to maintain ABC funding.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to make a point about ministerial accountability. How come it  suits this government to stand up and say, `It's not our fault that the cuts are in this area. We just cut the funding. It's the ABC management that have made the cut in this area,' and Senator Alston stood up here and said that himself? We have had other examples of this government doing exactly the same thing&mdash;cutting significant chunks of funding out of public institutions and then standing up in this place and saying, `Oh, it wasn't our fault they've had to cut that end of the service. It's the fault of the management of that particular institution.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very fine example of this in the ACT itself. The closure of the High Court on weekends is a classic example of the government cutting the overall budget of an institution and the institution having to make some very hard decisions about how it was going to survive and cope with the magnitude of those cuts. We are also talking about ministerial accountability and the responsibility that Senator Alston has to stand up here and take the wrap for the cuts that have occurred in all of the services&mdash;not just the ABC but everywhere else.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the first things that Senator Lundy will learn following her elevation to the frontbench is that the last person you would want to come in here and try to defend is Senator Schacht. I would have to say that Senator Schacht must have drawn the short straw in having to get up and take note of the answer that was given during question time today by Senator Alston. Senator Schacht was absolutely slaughtered by Senator Alston's response in which the minister referred to Senator Schacht's media release. The one thing that Senator Schacht, Senator Lundy and Senator Bourne would not refer to is the media release of Senator Schacht in which he talks about `everywhere you go, you will have to take the weather with you'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutting of the weather is yet another chapter in the sad story of ABC cuts. How 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wrong can you get it? All Senator Schacht does is sit there and talk about a slick Melbourne lawyer defence. I can tell you, I would rather have a slick Melbourne lawyer defence. It is far better than a failed Labor minister and trade union official defence, I can tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht drew the short straw. I happen to live outside the metropolitan area and weather reports are very important. If weather reports were going to be cut, the first place you would get a response from would be those people in the bush who rely entirely on the weather reports for planning ahead for what they need to know and what they need to do in their day-to-day work. I do not care who gives the weather report. I could not care less whether it is a special weather presenter or whether it is the principal newsreader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing that really matters to people outside the metropolitan area who listen on a daily basis to weather reports&mdash;and the only reason they listen to them&mdash;is finding out with some reasonable accuracy what the weather will be. Under this government, they are going to find out with even more accuracy what the weather is going to be because a new $40 million computer has just been installed in Melbourne which gives much more accurate five day forecasts. This money has been spent, so they will get more accurate weather reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed by the press release of Senator Schacht's. I am amazed, Senator Lundy, that you would stand up to try to defend Senator Schacht. In his press release, Senator Schacht said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other sad aspect of the Minister banning the weather is the loss of the familiar face reading the weather reports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The really sad aspect is that you are not going to see a familiar face reading the weather reports. Who would care who was reading it as long as you get the results? The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC localises all of its weather reports, often showing photographs sent in by people from around the state and creating a sense of community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the next sentence of this media release really tops it all off. Senator Schacht says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5818">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston now goes down in history as the only Minister to have banned the weather.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I reckon that is a feat in itself&mdash;to ban the weather. From now on there will be no weather, Minister, because you have banned it. I am so sorry to hear it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real truth of the matter is that Senator Schacht drew the short straw. It was his turn to take note of answers and no other answers were thought worthy of taking note of. Senator Schacht, having just been slaughtered by Senator Alston, got up to try to restate his case. In doing so he talked about cuts to the ABC and not his press release, and his press release was the very issue that Senator Alston raised in his answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that, if Senator Schacht's effort in taking note of answers is the best that you can come up with in trying to be critical of answers that are given by this government, I would suggest that in future you have a little round table meeting prior to question time. Senator Lundy, you want to be ready to move up a seat or two because Senator Schacht is surely skating on very thin ice, although, if that is a weather prediction, we do not know if there is going to be any ice. But if we do have some ice, Senator Lundy, you will be next.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I brought the matter of the extension of privacy laws to the privacy sector before the chamber today because the Australian Demo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crats are on the record as expressing our concern&mdash;indeed our condemnation of this government&mdash;that the government has failed to deliver what was an election promise. That is, their promise to extend those very laws to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A discussion paper was released by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) on 12 September 1996 which set out a scheme based on the existing information privacy principles that are in the Privacy Act 1988 and added to this codes of practice and a range of additional provisions which address the particular concerns of the private sector. In essence, this was a proposal for industry codes of practice that were to be supported by the Privacy Commissioner and subjected to statutory backing&mdash;essentially, a co&hyphen;regulatory approach. This scheme was consistent with schemes being adopted in other parts of the world. I can name the European Union, Hong Kong and New Zealand among those countries which have similar principles and schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on 21 March this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced that the Privacy Act 1988 would not be extended to the private sector. The Prime Minister essentially ended Australia's chance at an international best practice privacy scheme. This was another election promise broken. It was an absolute backflip from this government, and one that we have had little justification for, or explanation of, to date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rolled by his mates, suggests Senator Woodley. As Senator Woodley would note, I am sure, a decision of this importance should not be passed off without some level of explanation. It is a matter of urgency, I believe, and it is one that the parliament cannot ignore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to legislate for a national and a consistent privacy scheme applying to all sectors of the Australian community is a short&hyphen;sighted disaster for all Australians. By that, I include not only businesses and industries but individual consumers. Our access to new technology and the data flows in our region and across the world will be severely limited by a failure to have adequate privacy regulation. This is quite clearly a matter of Australian jobs and lifestyles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The G7 industrialised countries and the APEC ministers have identified privacy as an  issue which is vital for commercial reasons. So everyone else is identifying this as an important issue; it is just us who are lagging miserably behind. New Zealand, the European Union and a number of other countries in our region have adopted legally enforceable privacy laws. This is serious&mdash;the fact that they are doing it and we are not&mdash;and it should be reviewed. To date, we have had no willingness from this government to undertake such a review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among businesses and their customers, privacy is a particular. It is a primary concern. In fact, Price Waterhouse surveyed 130 large businesses earlier this year and found that 70 per cent favoured, 10 per cent were neutral and 20 per cent opposed the introduction of comprehensive national privacy laws. The survey concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian business has identified privacy as a major business risk and they are looking to the Australian government for guidance on how to manage it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they have looked to this government for guidance, but certainly none has been forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This survey confirmed an earlier survey conducted by the Faculty of Business and Economics at Monash University, which found that businesses recognised the import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance of personal information to their clients and employees. So I asked the government where they got their conclusive evidence that introducing privacy laws would increase compliance costs and regulatory burdens, when this data clearly shows that businesses want privacy regulation. That is the only excuse I have had from this government&mdash;that somehow it would lead to increased compliance costs. It is a somewhat dubious argument, and we have yet to see any data that backs it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Commissioner states that there is significant evidence of unfair information on privacy practices, which creates a real problem for real people in Australia. She receives something like 15,000 complaints per year and a significant number of these are about privacy intrusions in the private sector&mdash;that one area that is relatively uncovered. Similar responses came from the telecommunications ombudsman and the South Australian privacy committees. I have a number of examples as to privacy intrusion that are not covered but should be covered by legislation. I note these examples, which have been provided by the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example provided was of a woman who gave birth in a hospital and the baby died within a few days. For weeks afterwards, the woman received at her home congratulatory notes from a range of baby product companies which had bought details of new mothers from the hospital. Outrageous!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second example provided by the commissioner was of a man who found he was having difficulty getting insurance. He eventually found out that he had been mistakenly confused with someone else with the same name who had a record of insurance fraud. It took him a significant period of time to have this confusion sorted out and corrected. No wonder state and territory governments are considering and examining privacy legislation options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If state and territory governments do introduce privacy schemes, businesses will be required to satisfy requirements which may be different for each state and each territory. A fragmented approach to privacy regulation and protection is likely to increase compliance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5825"> costs&mdash;the very thing the Prime Minister wanted to avoid&mdash;and the regulatory burden for many businesses. This is an approach that has been adopted in Canada, where there is a centralised scheme for public agencies and a whole hotchpotch of province laws with varying requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses and consumers have to look to a range of different and sometimes inconsistent regulations. This is exactly what Australian consumers do not deserve. It is something that we want to avoid, and certainly Australian consumers and businesses do not need that kind of fragmented approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures alone should be enough to encourage the government to reconsider its privacy backflip. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights include privacy measures. It is a fundamental principle, a fundamental right, that a person has a  right to know what information is held about them and, if that information is lawfully held, that the information is correct. So privacy is a human rights issue, and the government should deal with this issue appropriately by introducing a suitable legislative scheme to comply with Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on Monday in this place, I tabled an exposure draft that looked to some possible options for extending privacy laws to the private sector in Australia. Essentially, it was for the purpose of community consultation and, given that privacy is such a complex matter, we would benefit as a parliament from a range of different viewpoints and a range of community input into various beliefs and ideas of different consumer and representative organisations. I suggest that a Senate committee might be an appropriate way of canvassing the broader perspectives in this debate and also a way of seeking a good basis for legislative reform. So I hope the government will perhaps consider taking up this option as a way of addressing the privacy backflip that it was responsible for earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, the Privacy Commissioner released a document that sought the views of the Australian community for a privacy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme based on voluntary participation and self-regulation. This is a commendable response to what the Privacy Commissioner herself has described as a broad consensus that there is an urgent need for a national consistent framework for the protection of information privacy. Her framework is a best attempt to cover up the privacy vacuum that has been left by this government, but it does fall very short of the kinds of schemes Australians were promised&mdash;promised by the current government&mdash;at the last election. This is supported by a range of consumer and other groups which have boycotted this consultation because of its self-regulation and its voluntary nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I recognise these concerns, particularly among those consumer groups, and reiterate that a voluntary and self-regulatory scheme is insufficient. If I have time today, I will refer to some of the information I have had from consumer groups, including Privacy International, which has sent an open letter to the Prime Minister outlining their international concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for privacy is also being driven by technological development. Storing and exchanging information on electronic devices is much easier, and the applications are dependent on that personal information. So, to embrace the new technologies and the new commercial possibilities, consumers and businesses need to be sure that personal information is safe. So technology is one reason that these laws, more so than ever, are imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe our community wants this legislation: consumers, individuals, businesses. I am glad of the opportunity to bring this matter before the Senate today. I only hope the government acts on it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, Madam Acting Deputy President.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that, if Senator Stott Despoja had the right to choose the topic for today, she may have chosen one of those really urgent matters that are facing the community today&mdash;those matters that this government is addressing to fix up after 13 years of Labor failure.

It has been around for nine years, and all of a sudden it is urgent that it be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madam Acting Deputy President, if we are talking about straining the standing orders, I think we should look at standing order 75. I have to say to you that it really does seem to strain the credibility of the standing orders and the processes of this parliament for Senator Stott Despoja to get up and say that somehow this is a matter of urgency. The matter of privacy is an important issue within this community, and we in the Liberal and National parties have a great record on that issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which parties were the ones that stood up against your Australia Card, Senator Neal? We on this side blocked that, and we did so unreservedly and unashamedly because we believe in fundamental privacy principles. So I am very interested, Senator Neal, that you are on the speakers list to make a contribution. You might like to explain to the Australian people about your fundamental commitment to privacy and how that somehow marries in and dovetails with the Australia card proposal of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia Card was an outrageous proposal, but it was indicative of the fact that you somehow believe that every individual in the community ought to submit themselves to Big Brother. We on this side do not believe in that. That is why we, as a matter of privacy for the individual, fought so hard against the Australia Card. The community recognises that, and we are seen on this side of the chamber as the champions of the individual and their individual privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles of privacy are set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act, and they are good and important principles. The legislation that is currently on the statute book in this country was developed over a considerable period of time. Sure, we can look at amendments; we can look at refining it; we can see about making amendments and changes to it, but to trot into this parliament today and somehow say that this is a matter of urgency&mdash;when there are so many people unemployed in this country and when we are facing a huge debt&mdash;really defies belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders what Senator Stott Despoja and the Democrats did during the break we had in this parliament. I have to say that, when I went door knocking and when I went to community groups, not a single person raised with me the issue of privacy&mdash;let alone that somehow it was a matter of such national urgency and importance that it ought be debated within the first three days of us resuming.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5827">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not been quiet on this very important issue of privacy. Indeed, the Attorney-General's Department released a discussion paper in September. Responses to that discussion paper provided the government with very clear guidance as to the real concerns of business and industry and individuals on possible government approaches to privacy protection. What you have to understand is that, if you put another web of red tape over the top of business and industry, it will cost jobs; it will make them less competitive. We as a government also went to the election promising to reduce the red tape. So we had two competing principles. It is not so very simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I find so very frustrating about the Australian Democrats&mdash;they always come into this place with a simplistic answer. One day they will talk to you about cutting red tape for small business as a matter or urgency; the next day they will say, `You have got to bring in privacy legislation.' The fact that those two concepts might conflict and require some sound judgment absolutely defies the</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Democrats. They can never grasp that some of the problems and difficulties that we as a government have to deal with are multi&hyphen;pronged. As a result we as a government are looking through the privacy issue in a mature and considered manner&mdash;concepts which are completely foreign and not understandable by the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 August, the Privacy Commissioner released a consultation paper proposing the development of national standards. To the listeners out there: that was only 12 days ago. This issue is currently under consideration and being developed by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and the Privacy Commissioner. We are looking and working through those issues. The issue, therefore, really is for the Democrats to come before us and say that the privacy issue is of such fundamental importance that somehow it ought to take top rung on the ladder of priorities facing this nation. I have to say to you, it is an important issue; it is a concept that all of us grapple with. All of us have our own particular ideas and views. But you can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hardly come into this chamber and pretend, with any degree of credibility, that it is a matter of urgency that is above some of the other issues that I have mentioned in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues and concerns within the community about privacy. That is clear. They are issues that need to be addressed. But, after 13 years of Labor, this government has had to set certain priorities in relation to turning the ship of state around to a proper course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say it is always difficult, in the light of Senator Abetz's provocative statements, to stay focused on the issue at hand. But I have to say that I was a bit disappointed, bearing in mind Senator Abetz's usual way of dealing with matters, that he feels unable to deal with the substantive issue at hand today, which is the Privacy Act and its extension to the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the issue of privacy is not a new issue. It has probably been on the agenda since the early 1980s. In fact, when the Labor government was elected in 1983, less than one year later, Lionel Bowen, who was to become the Deputy Prime Minister, made a statement that a privacy act would be enacted. Privacy legislation was enacted in 1986, with subsequent legislation being carried in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be a view that what has been done at the moment is adequate and there is not an urgent situation. I have to say that I disagree with that proposition because circumstances have changed very markedly in the short period since the election of this government. The Prime Minister, John Howard, at the time he was seeking election, made a very clear statement to the Australian people that he intended to put in place privacy legislation that extended to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that, as we know, is not what took place. What happened was that Daryl Williams, the Attorney&hyphen;General, was asked to produce a discussion paper. This discussion paper, released in September 1996, was very well received. Probably most of you have had an opportunity to have a look at it. Not only was it very well received by consumers and individuals, but contrary to the Prime Minister's view, or his apparent view, it was extraordinarily well received by the business community as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was optimistic that, after the discussion paper's release and its reception, this government would go ahead and introduce that legislation. Of course, that is not what occurred. In a blatant breach of his promise, the Prime Minister in March 1997 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth opposes such proposals which will further increase compliance costs for all Australian businesses, large and small.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His response, in fact, was to ask the Privacy Commissioner at HREOC, with its reduced financial resources, to prepare a consultation paper on information practices in the private sector in lieu of legislative extension of the Privacy Act to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time that discussion paper was being proposed, the Labor Party held its peace, because we were wanting to see the protections in place and thought that we would give it a go; that we would see what the discussion paper proposed before we made a judgment. One should always be optimistic in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite a lot of fine work done by the Privacy Commissioner&mdash;a lot of the information contained in that discussion paper is extraordinarily useful&mdash;it is our view that it is not an adequate response or adequate alternative to having a legislative base for an extension to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not only my view. The community at large was very much of the view that it was not an adequate response. It is not some consumer groups that have refused to discuss the report with the Privacy Commissioner: a total of 15 consumer groups have said that they do not intend to liaise further with the Privacy Commissioner to progress this discussion paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Puplick, an ex&hyphen;coalition senator, said&mdash;and I will quote some of the key portions of his statements:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certain things have happened internationally over the last two years that mean that, if Australia does not legislate to protect our privacy, we will be falling behind in international trade and international economy. Both Hong Kong and the European Parliament have passed legislation that data, and particularly personal information, should not be provided to those countries that do not have sufficient protections in place .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that the proposals set out here in the discussion paper by HREOC at the behest of the Prime Minister are not adequate to meet those guidelines. This government's failure to take action in terms of privacy ensures that Australia is excluded from the fastest growing industry in the world. That is not an overstatement of the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contained in the Attorney&hyphen;General's discussion paper are some comparisons and exam ples of other jurisdictions that have put these sorts of protections in place. I was interested to see that in the Canadian example many businesses that had initially thought that there would be great impositions had found at the end that the costs were minimal and that they had made substantial gains in consumer confidence by putting in place those protections of personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an urgency at the moment. The private sector must be included within the bounds of the Privacy Act. That is imperative because of the increasing and rapid change in information technology and the transfer of personal information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Privacy is a major issue in our society. The Privacy Act was put in place as part of a recognition of the international standards in relation to preservation of privacy. Privacy has become an urgent issue with the decision to outsource various aspects of government activity. A major area of outsourcing is collection, analysis, organisation, storage, retrieval and maintenance of information. It is something people can do outside of government departments, and information technology is a major target of government outsourcing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In part, this issue has arisen through application of the principles of competition policy. This policy demands that services provided by government be open to competition or at least to bidding by the private sector. But the real agenda of this government is to divest government of all the functions it can, on an ideological assumption that the private sector can do it better, more cheaply and make a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outsourcing information technology has been done through opening bidding, generally without really allowing or considering in&hyphen;house bidding. Government does not want to know whether existing departments can actually do a job more cheaply and with better reliability. It wants to outsource to big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ask the Australian information technology industry about the tenders. They are designed so that only a couple of major transnational companies&mdash;like IBM&mdash;will effectively fit the tendering profile, if reports from the IT industry are to be believed. But there are no effective provisions that require private sector IT operators to maintain privacy, and there is no regime in place to monitor whether or not they are doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government bureaucracies there have been cases where examination of personal information for private purposes has been picked up and prosecuted. With the private sector, however, we are potentially talking about people who set themselves up as effi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5830"> cient because they are information&hyphen;processing experts. They will be very possibly working for several public and private clients, they will be minimising cost and this will probably include having minimal supervision regarding privacy, unless it is required. Remember, this is a competitive world; if it is not required, it will be cheaper not to provide it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More of a worry: one of the cheapest and most common means of dealing with information input is to send it to India for input. Indian computer subcontractors work for huge numbers of public and private organisations. So in a competitive situation like that without regulatory legislation, where is the guarantee of privacy? It is time to look at the social impacts of competition policy before it is too late. I also urge senators to support a Senate inquiry into the social impacts of competition policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue, as raised by the Democrats, makes a complete fool of them by proposing quite unnecessary extensions of privacy legislation, which quite appropriately currently applies to the public sector, to the private sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no evidence of the need for an extension of the Privacy Act to the private sector at this time. Nevertheless, the government does want to ensure that there is an appropriate Australia&hyphen;wide privacy regime. That is why last September a discussion paper was released by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) outlining the possible approach to privacy protection in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responses to that discussion paper have provided the government with very clear guidance as to the genuine and real concerns of business and industry on the possible government approaches to privacy protection. Those responses clearly indicated that there is no need at this time for a legislative response to those privacy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business. We demonstrated that very clearly when, not long after being elected to government, we established a task force to achieve this very goal. The result of that task force was the so-called Bell report, because that task force was, indeed, chaired by Mr Bell. The recommendations of that report have largely been adopted by the government. As a result of that, we will see a significant reduction in the regulatory burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to privacy issues is quite consistent with that objective. It demonstrates that the government is committed to assisting and encouraging the private sector in developing and abiding by fundamental privacy principles. The government has decided that the Privacy Commissioner will be available to assist business in its endeavours to meet privacy standards and will be available to assist business with the development of voluntary codes of conduct. As a result of that determination by the government, the Privacy Commissioner has initiated a range of meetings with industry and consumer groups as a starting point for developing codes of conduct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5832">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, as recently as 15 August, the commissioner released a consultation paper proposing the development of national standards for handling personal information by the private sector. This continues the process which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) commissioned in March. We believe that the Privacy Commissioner's consultations with the private sector will develop an appropriate framework for privacy protection without unnecessarily increasing compliance and regulatory costs for Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by mentioning in response to what Senator Margetts put before this chamber that she has quite clearly confused the issue of the private sector generally with the process of contracting out of previous government services. The government has announced that the privacy legislation will be extended to cover the contracting out of government services, but that is a quite different issue to generally extending a legislative response to the private sector on the whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a very good motion. I do think it is a matter of urgency that Senator Stott Despoja has brought forward. If you look at what privacy is about, then you can see the  force of this motion. Everyone has an inherent right to keep control of information about them. The access to that information is rightly theirs to determine. That means that there is information that is yours alone. There is information about you that you, as a citizen of this community, should be able to retain control of and which should not be taken out of your possession without your permission. If it is taken out of your control, then you should know about it and have access to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are issues of privacy, even for small business. A small business can be sent bankrupt by a bank failing to give credit on the basis of information which that small business does not know about. One of the rules of privacy is this: not only should people have the right to maintain information about them 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is rightly theirs but, if you are going to have laws which say that people or institutions are allowed to have information about others&mdash;or even if you have not got a law and the situation is that people have information about other people&mdash;then that should be available to the people about whom that information is held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and even government itself, say, `Yes, it is all right for us to hold information about you. We can know all that we want to know about you, but you can't get information about us.' The great test of that, of course, is the estimates committees. We go along on behalf of the people of Australia to get information about government and they say, `No, you can't have information about what we are doing. You can't have our legal opinion. You can't have information about why we made this particular decision. But we can hold information about you.' The Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Social Security and the income tax office can hold information about you, but you cannot look at the information that those bodies hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole motion is talking about those two issues. The first issue is what information should people be able to have about others and what information should people be able to keep control of. The second: if information about a person or people generally is to be made available to all and sundry, then that should be the law for everyone. If it is good enough for information to be made available about private individuals, why isn't it good enough for information to be made available about banks, about taxation offices or about the police force, if you like?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to say, `It doesn't matter how far the contravention of privacy is spread, we don't need laws to protect privacy,' then what about those laws that&mdash;in my view, properly&mdash;protect the information that law enforcement authorities hold? If it is good enough to have laws to protect that, why isn't it good enough to have laws that protect people who are going to be injured by information that is made available about them?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue to raise in this regard is what information people should be able to obtain from you. I think this is also a matter of urgency because there are calls at the moment to get rid of the right to silence. People are saying that people should not be able to withhold information about themselves if law enforcement authorities, for example, should be able to obtain information from people if they want to ask them questions. If you are in court and you maintain the right to silence, or if you are being questioned by the appropriate authorities and you maintain the right to silence, then that should be used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator McGauran is one of the most eminent backbenchers in the government  parties his reaction worries me because I think it indicates an attitude within the government. I think Senator Stott Despoja's case has been made out because they are ignorant of one of the great issues in history and ignorant of one of the great issues of the moment which is the ability to keep private and keep to yourself what is properly yours. That apparently does not resonate on the benches of the government because they laugh at, in my view, the greatest figure in history. Senator McGauran obviously does not consider that to be so. I digress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of privacy is fundamental and one that needs to have the force of law behind it to make it effective. The government talks 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the right to privacy, but there is a refusal to bring in laws to back that up in the private sector. It says that the private sector does not want that. I would be very surprised if that were the case. I would have thought that the private sector would be interested to know what those big financial institutions do with the information they have about those small businesses, but, in any event, the government says it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put the proposition to the Senate that there are laws giving people enforceable rights to life and limb. If a person attempts to kill you or attempts to maim you there are laws to protect you. There are laws to protect your securities and shares in companies. There are laws to protect your land and chattels. There are laws to protect your intellectual property and your reputation. The government does not say anything about the cost or the terrible burden it places on the community having law enforcement authorities, courts and procedures whereby people can manifest these rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that privacy, this inherent right to maintain information about yourself or if information about you is going to be made available that it should be made available about everybody else, should be separated out from other rights? It is all right for the community to bear the expense of protecting other rights but not the right to privacy. I think this is a very important matter. It is a matter that has been delayed too long. Economic rights are important but civil rights are very important too. We have neglected them. I think it is urgent that we get on to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should note that, even without Senator the Rev. John Woodley in this debate, we certainly still seem to have reference to religious and historical matters of significance. I congratulate Senator Cooney on his contribution to this debate. But I cannot go without mentioning the fact that what is most insulting and offensive to me about this debate is not the government's unwillingness to recognise that the matter of extending privacy laws to the private sector is an urgent matter, but the way that three backroom boys were sent in to be insulting to me and my party. I want to note for the students who may be left in the gallery that dismissing me as a fool or a kid is really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite petty in this debate. I want on the record that I took offence at Senator Chapman's and Senator Abetz's contributions to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also a bit disturbed that they knew nothing about the issue. But, rather than go through a privacy 101 course for the benefit of Senators Abetz, Chapman and McGauran, I will simply state a couple of things that they need to know. Compliance costs is the only argument that has been put forward by these senators to date. Where is their evidence? Where is the data that suggests that compliance costs will increase? In fact, all the evidence we have suggests that the only reason the regulatory burden would increase and compliance costs go up would be if there were a hotchpotch of fragmented regulations among the states and territories as opposed to a nationally consistent enforceable privacy legislation scheme. Senator McGauran, I look forward to seeing some statistics from you on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the urgency in this debate, in September last year the Attorney&hyphen;General recognised this as an urgency debate. It is why, I presume, the government went to the election promising to introduce privacy laws for the private sector. What has changed? We have seen no evidence, no rationale, for the government's backflip, except that the Prime Minister essentially vetoed the idea of introducing legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the principal messages of my visit was that my government intended to build on this shared history and shared values in looking ahead and creating modern and dynamic partnerships which meet Australia's contemporary needs and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States is the largest investor in Australia, and the United Kingdom the second largest. The United Kingdom invests more in manufacturing in Australia than any other foreign investor and so is a very important source of employment in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was also pleased to have the opportunity to call on the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a very valuable round of discussions with Mr Blair and leading members of his government, including the deputy prime minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, defence secretary, foreign secretary and home secretary. I was pleased to find that they share my conviction of the growing strength and relevance of the relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was struck by how much there is in common between my government and Mr Blair's on the challenges faced by our societies&mdash;especially the issues of unemployment and the role of welfare&mdash;and the need to address those challenges, not with ideological prescriptions but by looking for practical ways to achieve results. I was particularly interested to hear about the welfare to work proposals of the new government and Mr Blair's views on changing attitudes in modern societies towards welfare and how they married with much of our thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both with the UK government and in my meetings with leaders of the UK business community, I was able to set out first hand the strength of the Australian economy. The reality is that our economy over 1997 and 1998 is predicted to grow more strongly than any of the G7 economies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pointed out in my meetings that Australia's integration into the Asia Pacific region and the United Kingdom's with Europe were making our bilateral links more relevant and valuable&mdash;rather than the reverse as some might think. No two countries in their respective regions have closer relationships or a better understanding of each other than Australia and the United Kingdom. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits are becoming more evident in the number of British companies locating their regional headquarters in Australia and using Australians skills and expertise to expand their business in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and the United Kingdom hold different positions on climate change, which is not surprising given the differences in the structures of our economies. I made clear to Mr Blair and his government that Australia is prepared to play her part in tackling greenhouse gas emissions. But we will not be party to a legally binding uniform target which no&hyphen;one honestly expects will be achieved, which is discriminatory in its economic consequences and which does not make an effective contribution to improving the world's environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A continuing irritant in our bilateral relations is the UK government's refusal to index pensions for UK residents in Australia. Mr Blair and I agreed that as a first step officials would reach an understanding on the actual costs involved&mdash;lack of agreement on this has so far obstructed sensible discussion of the issue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My visit to the United States was an opportunity to build on the success of President Clinton's visit to Australia last year. I met a very wide range of key figures in President Clinton's administration, Congress and the business community in New York. My meetings left me in doubt about the strength of the US alliance with Australia and the value the United States places on it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our shared strategic and economic interests in the Asia Pacific region meant that the future of our region was an important focus of my discussions in Washington and New York. The other was my message that under my government's reform programme the Australian economy was creating new opportunities for US business to use Australia as a base for operations in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasised the vital importance of continued US engagement in the region. The interests of Australia, the United States and the region are all served by the United States continuing to make a strong contribution to the stability and economic growth of the region.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was reassured by my discussions with President Clinton and others in his administration of the continuing commitment of the United States to exercising its leadership, economic power and strategic influence to help ensure the region's stability and prosperity into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a tribute to the role Australia plays in the region that President Clinton and members of his administration and Congress want to know what Australia thinks of developments in the region and to discuss ways in which we can extend our cooperation there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While sharing fundamental objectives, Australia's specific geography and interests means that she has a different perspective on the region from the United States&mdash;and that makes our views useful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a major speech to the Foreign Policy Association annual dinner, I set out Australia's views on the important changes taking place in the region and how we should respond to them. The opening up and modernising of economies and societies in the region are bringing immense benefits for the countries of the region and their peoples. It is in our interests to reinforce these trends and to encourage the integration of regional economies into the world economy rather than lecture them about their shortcomings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, it is in the interests of Australia, the United States and the region that we maintain broad and balanced relationships with Indonesia within which differences for example on human rights can be handled productively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government and the Clinton administration agree on the importance of integrating China into the region. We agree also on the importance of APEC's role in sustaining the growth of regional economies by freeing up trade and investment. We are keen to see APEC's momentum maintained under the Canadian chairmanship at Vancouver.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An active and credible ANZUS alliance is an important part of the contribution we both make to the region. I was pleased to highlight that with an invitation to the Seventh Fleet to visit Australia in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian and US positions on climate change are not the same&mdash;but we share a desire for a realistic and equitable outcome of the Kyoto meeting. President Clinton acknowledged the need for flexibility in order to achieve that and we agreed on the need to find a way of involving the developing countries effectively in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased to hear Dr Greenspan comment on the strong position of the Australian economy.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I was pleased to see when I visited Salomon Brothers a graph which plotted the differential between Australian and United States Treasury bonds. When my government came to office the margin was about 250 points against Australia. On the day I visited, the margin had dropped to only 60 points. Recently it has dropped to 25 points. This is a measure of the extent to which in the past 17 months we have been able to repair the fundamentals of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was interested to hear from the US administration and business their views on how the US economy's impressive rate of job creation has been achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In agreeing to take note of this statement, I cannot allow the opportunity to pass to condemn the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for having failed to attend the Earth Summit in New York, which was attended by some 100 heads of state, including the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, heads of states from Japan, France, Germany, Russia and right around the world. What happened was that our Prime Minister was sipping tea with Baroness Thatcher and twiddling his fingers in London, as the Lord's cricket match was not on because it rained, while a world conference on the environment and sustainable development 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5839"> was attended by heads of state from almost everywhere else on the planet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have to ask why John Howard did not represent Australia. Why didn't he do us proud at this prestigious international gathering? The reason is that he is downright ashamed of his government's environmental record. I note the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is absent, but he would be able to endorse the fact that since John Howard came to office the already destructive process of woodchipping in our native and wild forests in this country has been accelerated. It has been accelerated by the Prime Minister who referred to the last Prime Minister, Mr Keating, with some good reason, as the Prime Minister for woodchipping. What John Howard has done is leapfrog the record of the Keating government and accelerate the destruction of native forests and wildlife in this country at a time when that industry is job shedding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is about expanding uranium exports out of this country into the unsafe nuclear industry, which countries like France, Sweden and Great Britain are getting out of, because there are dollars in it. This government would sell off anything and let the devil look after the next generations. Not least amongst some 15 uranium mines on the slate is Jabiluka, where the traditional owners do not want that mine in the heart of this magnificent valley in Kakadu. This government is about to ride across the top of social justice and environmental parameters. Any sane, responsible and caring government would stand against that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, amongst the other multitude of sins of this government as far as the environment is concerned, and what should be a matter of great shame for John Howard&mdash;and  ample reason as to why he stayed away from New York&mdash;is the abhorrent record his government has in its responsibility for tackling, along with the rest of the world, the greenhouse gas and global warming problem: Australians, per capita, are the worst defaulters on the face of the planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister's policies are dictated by the coal industry, by dollars, not the rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of future generations, certainly not the rights of our neighbours living on islands and certainly not the rights of people who right around the world are going to have to grapple with the awesome downside of the neglect by this Prime Minister of his national and global responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happened? He had tea with Baroness Thatcher and then he flew to Washington, bypassing New York. When he got to Washington he found that President Clinton was not there because President Clinton was spending four days in New York, three hours train ride up the line, with the rest of the world in what turned out to be an unsatisfactory conference but at least an effort to get together to try to tackle the world's environmental and therefore social problems. John Howard sat in Washington having coffee with Newt Gingrich, the extreme right representative of the Republicans, because he felt more at home with that than he did representing this nation at the biggest gathering of heads of government that he is likely to see in this period of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a failure of responsibility; it was a failure of national leadership; it was a demonstrable failure to represent this nation, to give Australia top level representation at a global conference which mattered. And if John Howard cannot do better than that he ought not to be in that office. If he has not got the vision beyond that narrowness which says `Baroness Thatcher before the world', he does not deserve to be in the prime office of this nation. He is selling out Australians, he is selling out this nation's interests and he is selling out future generations. He is not up to it, and we are seeing this more and more as we go down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Prime Minister who says that the great adventure for Australia, as we go into the next century and the next millennium, is going to be tax reform. As important as that is, it shows the degree of failure of imagination of this Prime Minister&mdash;imagination which, if it were firing and if it were up to the representation Australians expect, would have us as a middle order nation taking a lead amongst the community of nations in a planet that, for goodness sake, needs leadership. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5840"> did not get it in New York and we are not going to get it during this period in office of the Prime Minister&mdash;in office not at the Lodge, but in his residence in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose these things creep up on people slowly, but Australians have to recognise that there is a vacancy where we need leadership, that there is a vacancy where we need vision for the next generation coming after us, that there is a failure where we need success as a country that has everything going for it, if we want to take a lead in innovations, bright ideas and solutions as we move into the next century. The Prime Minister cannot even come to grips with that when it comes to such a simple thing as alternative power, solar power. The world is crying out for power alternatives which are going to help fix the global warming problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of that, he is subsidising diesel fuel use&mdash;greenhouse gas production&mdash;to the tune of $800 million a year for the mining corporations alone and cutting $20 million to $25 million out of energy research assistance for solar power. It just shows how wonky his priorities are, how far off&hyphen;beam he is, how narrow minded and, I think, self&hyphen;centred he is, and how limited his field of view is, when this great nation of ours needs statespersonship, vision, imagination and get&hyphen;up&hyphen; and&hyphen;go of the wider sense that goes beyond tax reform to the other values that we have to hold high in life if we are going to give fulfilment not only to this generation, but to the people who follow us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak to the motion to take note of this ministerial statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on his trip to the United States and the United Kingdom. When one reads the document that the Prime Minister has used to report on this trip, I  think one would have to say that this is a very thin justification for going. There are no matters of great moment contained in this document. It is a travelogue of meeting major Tory celebrities and hobnobbing with them in Britain. The list was: Baroness Thatcher, Mr Hague and John Major. In the United States the stand&hyphen;out personality was Newt Gingrich. This was a Tory celebration and a tour by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Prime Minister to get, no doubt, the approbation of his political kin in the United States and the United Kingdom. It did nothing for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was away, major issues occurred here that he did not attend to. The Newcastle steelworks was closed down and the protests about the jobs for people in that city reached a crescendo. The carcass of the then minister for small business, Mr Prosser, was turning in the wind awaiting finally being put to rest as he was a political neuter, given the clash of his personal interests and his public responsibilities. And that remained unresolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The handover of Hong Kong occurred. Our Prime Minister did not appear at that. Of course, as Senator Brown has just alluded to, the greenhouse gas conference was being held in New York at the United Nations. Major countries were represented by their heads of state, by their prime ministers or presidents. Australia was not. Australia was remarkable for that fact; Australia was represented by its Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and therefore was not able to mix it with the big boys in terms of the argument that it wanted to put. The level of representation sent was seen as an indication of the strength of the arguments Australia wanted to present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying, in that sense, that I justify the arguments that the government was wanting to put at that conference, but it downgraded its own ability to be respected by the level of representation it presented when most other nations were represented by their heads of state. The Chancellor of Germany was there, the President of France was there, the President of the United States was there, the Prime Minister of Britain was there; our environment minister was there. Our Prime Minister was at Lord's watching the cricket&mdash;or, rather, he wasn't because it rained on the day he went. If that is a signal of prime ministerial responsibility and priority setting, one has to say he has got it miserably wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Prime Minister's trip provided a huge source of levity for the cartoon drawers of Australia: at the Lord's test when it rained, and later when the Prime Minister opened the Ashes exhibition at Lord's and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5841"> described it as one of the greatest events of his prime ministership&mdash;`the greatest occasion of my prime ministership'. The opening of the Ashes museum in London was hardly a significant event for Australia. It was symbolically important for those interested in cricket and sport, but it was not something which changed the national destiny of this country. And then, in New York, Shirley MacLaine fell asleep while the Prime Minister was making his speech. She later apologised for that, but it was an indication of how vibrant and exciting things were on the Prime Minister's international trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal in some detail with two things which the Prime Minister has included in the report of his international trip and which I think should be explained to this parliament. Firstly, he argued in his report&mdash;and he argued in the media at the time&mdash;that, on meeting Tony Blair, the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain, their exchange had been useful because he and Blair had a common view about policies on unemployment and welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister used this point to argue that that meant that Labor in Australia was out of date or out of touch. Let me put a few of the facts on the record. The leader of the Labor Party in this national parliament, Mr Beazley, put these facts on the record directly to the Prime Minister in the debate in the other place earlier today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, from the day&hyphen;long discussions that Kim Beazley had with Tony Blair&mdash;as opposed to the short hour or so that the Prime Minister had with him&mdash;what was shown to be true was that Tony Blair is a friend of Australia. He is a friend of the Australian Labor Party. He gained inspiration to conduct his campaign in the United Kingdom from what he found in Labor in government in Australia. He is a personal friend of Kim  Beazley. The policies that John Howard was referring to were policies drawn by the British Labour Party from our Working Nation statement, and then presented in British style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister is praising when he praises those policies is Working Nation&mdash;a statement that he condemns in Australia, and a policy which he has dismantled here, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thus preventing the opportunity for unemployed people in this nation to gain access to training and jobs, and preventing the improvement of the lot of the long&hyphen;term unemployed. It is one thing to praise what the British Labour Party is proposing to do. Its model was Working Nation. That was the model we had in place in Australia, and that is the model that this government has shown respect for by scrapping. That is hardly sincere praise in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I wish to comment on is that the Prime Minister came away from his discussions with President Clinton having suddenly discovered the information industry. He had left Australia several weeks before that, in the closing week of the Senate during which, to the ignominy of information technology, the Senate voted, with a government majority, to scrap the computer bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The computer bounty was one of the things that underpinned the existence of an information technology industry in Australia. But, having scrapped it, the Prime Minister discovered, after having chatted with President Clinton, how important information technology is for the world, and how Australia must catch up&mdash;after his having demolished the basis on which information technology development was founded in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both these examples show a Prime Minister who in this way confesses that he knew not what he did: he had no policy vision; he was a policy&hyphen;free zone when it came to planning the industry, welfare and employment needs of this country in his first and second budgets. In both those budgets the Prime Minister chose to opt for a level of growth for the economy&mdash;a GDP growth level&mdash;of 3&frac34;per cent. In the first year it was not realised&mdash;we got 2.4 not 3&frac34;per cent. In choosing to set the budget at a growth level of 3&frac34;per cent knowing that, to make any impact on unemployment at all in this country, to bring unemployment down, this nation has to have its economy grow at 4&half; per cent, he made a positive choice to keep unemployment high and, in fact, for unemployment to grow. That is the inescapable conclusion from the budget settings of budget No. 1 and budget No. 2 of this government. The government chose a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5842"> level of economic growth in this country which would keep unemployment levels high, and growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the words the government members might say about their concern for unemployment, it is actions that decide sincerity, not words, and the actions were budget settings which will cause unemployment to remain high or to grow. When the Prime Minister talks, as he did in London, about concern for the unemployed and about what he might learn about how to keep them off welfare and get them back into the work force, one has to remember that this is the man who presided over a Treasurer who set budget growth levels below the level at which you can make a dent in unemployment levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were the targets. The actual performance in the budget of last year, as I said, was not 3&frac34;per cent but 2.4 per cent, so the actual outcome of the budget settings undershot the target that the government had set&mdash;you would have thought it would have done something to correct that in the second budget, but it did not&mdash;and any words we therefore hear from the Prime Minister about how he might tweak the system to make it marginally better, based on what he learnt from new Labour in London, are about moving the deckchairs on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must first fix the problem by growing this economy at the levels that it is capable of and within the speed limits that it is capable of achieving, at around five per cent or six per cent, and bring down the total level of unemployment. In that way, the issue of what you then do about the long&hyphen;term unemployed is the secondary question, because you are reducing the total number of unemployed. In facing that secondary question, the blueprint is the Working Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn for a minute to the industries of the future. The biggest industry in the  world and the fastest growing industry in the world is the information and telecommunications sector. Australia imports something like $6 billion worth of information technology a year. That is the net trade balance. We export some; we import some. The net deficit is about $6 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the end of this century, the net deficit will be $20 billion, unless we husband this industry in Australia so that we build here the type of technology that we now import and we replace those foreign imports with home-grown products. That would change the trade balance and create challenging, intellectually stimulating, highly skilled, technical jobs for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the program Labor was embarked on and, to help Australian industry achieve that, we had a bounty for computer production. That is, we paid a small amount to encourage this industry to re-establish itself here and make that equipment in Australia. Well, it is a matter of record that, just before the Prime Minister left for his overseas junket, he scrapped that bounty. He cut the ground from under this industry, pushing a number of these companies out of Australia and into new markets. They then had to export into Australia, and that pushed the level of trade deficit up even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister cut it out from under this industry without studying the impact and in the face of an Industry Commission report which found in favour of continuing the bounty. I might say that, over the last few weeks, we have heard of workers in the car industry attacking the Industry Commission for removing protection, and we have heard of workers just this week&mdash;and we will be moving a motion tomorrow on this subject&mdash;in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry attacking the Industry Commission for removing tariff protection from them, and with justifiable reason in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case, the Industry Commission had found that the bounty should remain. This ultra dry agency had found that the bounty should remain because that was the only way in which it could leave a growth in this industry sector. But the government&mdash;against the advice of the most dry economic group&mdash;cut that bounty out and then discovered, `God, we've got to do something to create an information technology sector in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the Goldsworthy report, but we do not know what the government is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5843"> going to do about that. Of the Goldsworthy report, let me say that it is a worthwhile try but it is nowhere near the answer to putting Australia on the map as a world power&mdash;as it could be&mdash;in the growth sector of the future. That is where the jobs will come from in the next century. So we have a Prime Minister who confesses his sins on both those fronts while away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard what Senator Brown has said with respect to the earth summit in New York. Indeed, it is true that the Prime Minister should have been there, he should have represented Australia and he should have put Australia's views. The fact that he chose not to is a massive slight to the rest of the world and a lack of faith in or commitment to the case Australia has been making internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no excuse for the Prime Minister to be at the cricket or sipping tea with Baroness Thatcher when the world was gathered in earnest consideration of the effect of greenhouse emissions on the ozone layer and was trying to cobble together an agreement about that. The fact that Australia was not represented is an enduring slight to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my remarks about this trip with another point that stands out. We do know this. Prior to the Prime Minister packing his bags for London, his office systematically leaked to Australian reporters, to tease them about how important his mission would be, that he would make a speech in London, the Menzies memorial lecture, and that in that speech he would link the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson&mdash;rightly, I might say, in my view&mdash;with the association of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States. He was to make a comparison of her policies and their policies, note the striking similarity between both and note the interdependence that seems to be growing between the Hanson group and those extreme right wing elements in the United States. That was leaked out of the Prime Minister's office to the Australian media, and the Australian media reported it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was that, when the Prime Minister rose to the lectern to deliver the Menzies memorial lecture, we waited to see exactly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how he would present this view. The truth is that he did not. He squibbed it. It dropped out of his speech. He did not actually do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders what mental processes were in his mind that caused him to make that shift. He had told the world that he was going to do it, and the world was expecting to hear from him about it. He was going to at last provide some leadership on what is, I think, one of the biggest international issues facing Australia now&mdash;that is, the fact that we are being characterised as a white racist nation by people who are not friendly to us. They are using the Hanson factor to justify it and, as they often do, are pointing to the Prime Minister of Australia as encouraging the Hanson forces because of his refusal to condemn her out of hand at the very beginning. The Prime Minister then says he is going to do it, and then he does not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of message is that sending to the rest of the world? That is a disgraceful message for the rest of the world. It gives rise again to the belief that this Prime Minister is soft on this sort of view being put in Australia, that he is quite happy to sit back and allow the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to do the hard yards, to make the condemnations that are appropriate and proper&mdash;and I support them in what they say&mdash;to express the tolerant and multicultural face of Australia to the world and to argue for its importance. But when the time comes for the Prime Minister to stand up and be counted on this issue, despite the fact that he leaks his intention to do so, he does not deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recess I visited a number of Asian nations as shadow minister for trade. I might say that the character of a nation is often judged by what the leaders of the nation say, and what the Prime Minister says or does not say on this subject is being treated as indicative of the views of the government and sometimes the views of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that he said he would perform and did not is taken to be further confirmation that perhaps there is a sneaking regard for Hanson policies in the government. I think the truth is that there is not, but the truth is that there appears to be, at least with the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5844"> Minister. That is a shocking view to have abroad. But that is the view abroad, and it is one that he has created by his failure to perform on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude as I began. His report to this parliament about what he did in the UK and the United States is a thin travelogue and a Tory tour of the world. It carries with it no lasting statesmanlike effort to place Australia better in the world than it was before he left. It recounts what the investment flows are between Australia and the United Kingdom and how important US and UK investment is to Australia, but that is citing the facts&mdash;the facts that were achieved by Labor when it was in government. What this report fails to do is show how the government intends to enhance that or take it further. I think the failing is in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trip overseas by the Prime Minister has been a damp squib and has not advanced our national interests. It has not advanced our national interests because he was preoccupied with cricket and he failed to perform in the Menzies lecture. He put Shirley MacLaine to sleep in New York. Then there was the unfortunate trip on the way to the rose garden in Washington. These incidents have caught the tone of this venture. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee does not insist upon its amendments to which the House of Representatives has insisted on disagreeing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government is presenting the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 to the Senate for what amounts to effectively the third time by way of this motion to the committee. In doing so, I think we are demonstrating our genuine sincerity in wanting to hold a constitutional convention. If we did not want to hold a constitutional convention, we would not have bothered to go through this process today. We would simply have said, `The Senate has voted against it twice. Clearly the Senate is not going to allow us to hold a constitutional convention. We will abandon the idea.' Nevertheless, we will give the Senate another opportunity to allow a constitutional convention to proceed by effectively re-presenting it to the Senate for a third time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to advancing the debate on the republic, despite the squeals from those opposite. The way in which we proposed this to the Australian people, which they endorsed, was to hold a constitutional convention. It is perfectly true that the coalition government is not committed, like the other parties, to Australia becoming a republic. On that basis, we need not have bothered with the process, but we have put forward a process to move 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5849"> this debate along. We made that quite clear in 1994&mdash;this is a policy we have had for three years&mdash;and we are attempting yet again to implement the policy that we went to the people with in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the irony in this is that all the opposition parties who run around the country desperate to have Australia become a republic are the ones who have refused to allow this debate to proceed by killing off the process put forward by the government. If the opposition parties are serious about progressing this debate, then they should obviously allow this bill to pass on this third occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem quite extraordinary to us that the opposition parties are deliberately sacrificing the process to advance the debate on a republic which they so want on the altar, frankly, of their obsession with compulsory voting. There can be no other interpretation of what has occurred to date. I have to say that, from the government's point of view, we do regard the opposition parties as behaving in a most extraordinary fashion on this matter. From the government's point of view, it has been a history of backflips and double standards and hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We announced this electoral system back in February. We said then in the Prime Minister's statement the process by which we proposed that delegates to the convention be elected. The Labor Party and the Democrats said at that stage that, while they did not like the voting system, it was not their intention to block it and prevent the process occurring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You said that you would not prevent the government's announced proposals for a voluntary postal ballot from proceeding. Mr Beazley made that quite clear and, I believe, the Leader of the Democrats (Senator Kernot) made that quite clear at the time. Of course, what appears to have happened is that the Left of the Labor Party, sitting together in the chamber at the moment, rolled the Labor leader, Mr Beazley, on this. They forced a complete backflip by demanding of the Labor Party outright opposition to this proposal. It is something that we do not really understand, given their passion  for the Australian republic. It does appear that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is absolutely founded upon a refusal to allow the government to have a voluntary postal ballot to elect delegates. That is the fundamental objection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the editorial of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> today&mdash;a paper out of the News Ltd stable, which is completely committed to an Australian republic. What we are talking about here is the opposition parties refusing to allow this whole process to go forward because of this fundamental principle&mdash;they say&mdash;of not allowing a voluntary postal ballot. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said, it is not the government which is going to thwart the event but a combined opposition vote. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general election was not a referendum on a republic or even a convention, though Mr Howard did have a policy for one. It was the bestowal of a mandate for a limited period on the coalition parties. Surely if an elected government wants to call a meeting it has the right to set the rules?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether people go is then their own concern. But to seek to change the rules is plain arrogant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I concur with the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  that the Senate is displaying the most extraordinary arrogance in saying to the government of the day, which wishes to hold a convention, that the Senate, in its petulant manner, will not tolerate the rules which the government have set which are perfectly reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those rules have been endorsed by the only independent electoral commentators that we have. The Electoral Reform Society and the Proportional Representation Society have both endorsed the rules that we have established&mdash;not these partisan, biased opposition senators. A journalist, of course, that I think even you might respect, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review's</EMPHASIS>, Michelle Grattan, said in her column on 19 June about this whole issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Labor's (and the minor parties) argument that voting for the republic convention should be compulsory? This, surely, is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree entirely with Michelle Grattan about the opposition's position on this thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have repeatedly stated, and I think it is fair to say this, that the position of the Labor Party and the Democrats on this question is entirely hypocritical. The Labor government back in 1989 brought into this parliament a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5850"> proposal to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and specifically provided in that bill that voting for the elections within ATSIC would be by a voluntary vote. I was not here at the time but I presume, in the event that it passed, that it was supported by the Democrats. This chamber and this parliament have, when it was run by the Labor Party, voted for, supported, introduced and authorised voluntary voting in national elections: to wit, elections to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had seven years to change that. You did not make any move to change away from voluntary voting for ATSIC elections. If voluntary voting is all right for the body that you set up to represent Aboriginal Australians, and which controls a budget of nearly $1 billion, why is it not all right for Australians, in voting to elect delegates to a national convention which will meet for 10 days, to have voluntary voting? It is an utterly ridiculous position that you are putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said many times, the Labor Party itself, through its industrial wing, presides over voluntary postal voting for trade union elections. Many of the Labor Party members in this parliament are, of course, the products of trade union officialdom, to which they came through voluntary postal voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague Senator Abetz has reminded the nation, the Leader of the Democrats in this parliament, Senator Cheryl Kernot, is elected by a voluntary postal ballot, to cap off the hypocrisy. The leader of the party that has the swing vote in this chamber, which can decide whether propositions become law or not, is elected by a voluntary postal ballot. But delegates to attend a convention to discuss the question of whether Australia should become a republic cannot be elected by a voluntary postal ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your opposition to this bill is so disingenuous that it is clear to us that you are simply determined to use whatever means you can&mdash;no matter how ridiculous and no matter how ill&hyphen;founded&mdash;to shatter our proposal for a constitutional convention. You are prepared to use any means at your disposal to prevent a constitutional convention proceeding. The Senate is insisting to the government that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ballot can only proceed if it is a compulsory attendance ballot. As we have repeatedly said, that is not acceptable to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not prepared to allow the Senate to set absolutely unreasonable rules for the election of delegates to this convention. We are not prepared, as a coalition government, to compel Australians to vote in this election of delegates to attend a convention. That is simply not consistent with our view of the world and we are not prepared to accept that proposition. As I have repeated many times, the proposition put forward by the Senate for a compulsory attendance ballot has been estimated by the AEC to add to the cost of the whole process an amount of somewhere around $15 million, up to possibly $20 million&mdash;more than the government's proposal.</PARA>

We are saying, `Yes, we are prepared to spend $35 million to allow Australians to elect delegates to this convention. We have budgeted up to $5 million to hold the convention itself and yet you, the opposition parties, are not prepared to accept that. You are insisting on us spending a whole lot more money for your compulsory attendance ballot, something that is just unacceptable to the government.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have floated a proposal for a Senate committee to look into this question.

We are proposing a national election of delegates which will involve every Australian. They will receive material from the government setting out the pros and cons of change. Material supplied by both sides of this debate will go to every household. They will have their chance to vote for delegates representing both sides of this debate. We will have 152 people elected from across Australia. All the state governments and oppositions will be represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention is a magnificent opportunity for a national debate of this issue. Instead, you just want a Senate committee to run around the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has said that the reason the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R192">Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997</XREF>  is back is that it wants to give Labor, minor parties and Independents in this place one last opportunity to support the Constitutional Convention. In doing so, Senator Minchin has said again today that if we fail to support this bill the convention will not proceed. Let us put aside for one moment the sheer arrogance of Senator Minchin's statement&mdash;a statement which shows very clearly that the government is not serious about a republic, it is not serious about engaging in a constructive and bipartisan approach to constitutional reform, and it is not serious about approaching this issue in the way that it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of our constitution has shown time and time again that proposals for reform succeed only when those proposals and the processes by which they are implemented are

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government which has sought to deliberately divide on this issue. They have asked the Labor Party and all other parties and Independents in this place to make what they know is for them an unacceptable choice. They want us to choose between progressing a republic and support for  compulsory voting. We do not want to choose between those two issues; we do not need to choose between them. We are not prepared to play your silly, divisive game, Senator Minchin. An increasing number of your backbench are getting tired of your silly, divisive game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, we will continue to support a compulsory ballot for the election of delegates to the People's Convention. If the government is not prepared to support a voting system that has served this nation well since 1924, it can explain that decision to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin quotes from the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> News Ltd newspaper. I will quote to you from the national News Ltd newspaper, Senator Minchin, what they said about your devious little games:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard did not campaign on the proposition that the selection of delegates to the people's convention should be used as a pilot for voluntary postal ballots.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They said a lot actually. I have only four short grabs here. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, the Government has made no case for the use of voluntary postal ballots for testing the waters on matters of ant importance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is News Ltd's points 1, 2 and 3. The fourth point was in the editorial yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the suspicion must be that the government is not so much interested in curbing the cost of the convention vote but in limiting the scope for a majority of electors overall to endorse a republic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know that that has been your motivation right from the start. The issue of the republic will not go away, Senator Minchin. Shortly, with the Democrats and others in this place, we will be initiating resolutions to establish either a joint select committee or Senate

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The republic issue is one that should be handed over to the Australian people. In order to do so, the committee we propose will, through a series of hearings, forums and public meetings, take the issue of the republic to the Australian people across Australia.</PARA>

We have had discussions and will continue to have discussions, and we will make sure that the overwhelming majority of Australians will be able to have a fair say in a fair process for a fair outcome.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very early decision you will have to make will be whether to support the establishment of a joint select committee or to let the Senate proceed with a Senate committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other matters that I would like to discuss at this stage&mdash;all of which surround what I must call the government's incompetence in the handling of this bill. The first and most important is the remarkable contribution made by Senator Abetz to this debate. Senators may recall that on Monday there was some unfounded speculation that the Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5853"> ian Democrats would do a backflip and support the convention bill. In that context, Senator Abetz said that the passage of the bill would be:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exposed all right, well and truly exposed. Not surprisingly, Senator Minchin quickly carpeted Senator Abetz and said that Senator Abetz was not speaking for the government. You can look at Senator Abetz's comments in one of two ways. One is that Senator Abetz was a fool for admitting what the government had repeatedly sought to deny in this debate&mdash;namely, that this bill was a Trojan horse for voluntary voting. If that is the true interpretation of Senator Abetz's comments, then he has only confirmed our worst fears about the bill. He has shown that the government is not serious about this bill or the republic and that it is more interested in some ideological pursuit of voluntary voting&mdash;an idea which 70 per cent of Australians oppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative view is that Senator Abetz, most likely in collusion with Senator Minchin, knew exactly what he was doing. He knew that his comments would force any non&hyphen;government senators who were considering changing their minds to oppose the bill. If that was his intent, then he and the government have, once again, shown their lack of commitment to the republic and to the convention.</PARA>

Of course, Senator Abetz may come in here and explain his actions, but I suspect he will not do that and, if he does, we will not know his motive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I want to discuss is why we are debating this bill this week. What the government has refused to admit is that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason why the House voted on the bill on Monday night and why we are voting on it today is that the government's so&hyphen;called master technician, the man who has all the high&hyphen;profile jobs, Senator Minchin, made a mistake. He forgot to return the Senate's message on this bill to the House at the end of last sitting. The effect of that mistake was that the time period required by section 57 of the constitution between the first and second rejections of a bill by the Senate only started to run two days ago when the House insisted on its amendments. But worse than making that mistake, Senator Minchin, your pathetic attempt to cover it up compounded the felony. In your press release issued last Friday you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is no indication that the Senate is likely to change its position on the Bill, it is the Government's view that the issue should be finally resolved early in this session.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Senate again insists on its amendments to the Bill, then the Constitutional Convention cannot be held in this term of Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite your comments, it is interesting to note that the three&hyphen;month gap required by section 57 of the constitution for a double dissolution trigger will now be completed in the last sitting week of the current session. In other words, the government still has the opportunity to use this bill as a double dissolution trigger, as they have repeatedly threatened to do, before the end of the year. Of course, Senator Minchin says, `We were never going to use it as a double dissolution trigger.' But what did the Treasurer say on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS> program? He clearly left open the issue as to whether this bill could be used for a double dissolution. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way a double dissolution trigger can come about is if Labor rejects legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Forget about the other parties in the Senate; it is just Labor as far as he is concerned. He continued:</PARA>

You have claimed you have a mandate to elect the delegates to the convention in any way that you want, but you do not have a mandate to do so contrary to the will of some 70 per cent of the Australian public who have made a decision as to whether or not they support voluntary voting. You continue to grossly overstate the cost of holding a compulsory ballot. Your figures have been dodgy from the start but, like Goebbels, you continue the big lie.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well we might laugh&mdash;and there is an awful lot of irony about that debate, that is so true&mdash;but the government's choice in bringing the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R192">Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill</XREF>  back to the Senate for the second time, in my view and in the Democrats' view, has absolutely nothing to do with their passionately wanting to have a constitutional convention; it has everything to do with the beginning of another deliberate government campaign to beat up the mythology of Senate obstructionism. That is what it is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has nothing to do with the government wanting to have a convention; it has everything to do with the very immature advice the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been given over the break to rescue his failing leadership. This was summed up by an article by Hugh Mackay in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 19 and 20 July, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week's Newspoll findings suggest that the Prime Minister has suffered an alarming slump in public esteem. Why?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this is about. This is about the advice that the Prime Minister has been given to rescue his leadership by being seen to take on the Senate. I recall reading that advice in the break. Paul Kelly, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> , said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard should keep calling the Senate's bluff and force either a series of Senate retreats (which depict his own strength) or, if the Senate holds, secure his reforms at a post-election joint sitting, inevitably a grand event.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Laurie Oakes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  of 29 July under the heading `Political circus in search of a strongman' again quotes the same story around the gallery. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advisers . . . will be telling him . . . that from now on, he should be uncompromising with the Senate; that he should bowl everything up to them, and not budge an inch. He needs to call the Senate's bluff . . . . If the opposition parties in the Senate do not back down, Howard will at least have been seen to take them on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this is about. The campaign is beginning. Biffo No. 1 is the convention, biffo No. 2 is the unfair dismissal law debate coming up and biffo No. 3 is native title. It is so transparent, Senator Minchin.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only problem is Australians do not actually believe that this self-imposed virility test and your criterion of macho aggression and taking on the Senate are the most important measure of leadership in this country. They do not agree with you. They will see through this transparent little campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus quoted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial of 26 August. Of course, Senator Minchin only quoted selectively from the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, his home&hyphen;town paper. We all know what campaigns it prefers to run. A June <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is clearly wrong to use the convention to experiment with voluntary voting. The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the republican convention, Nick Minchin, an ardent espouser of voluntary voting, stresses it is a one-off proposition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The obvious question is: why do it at all? Good question. That was June, but yesterday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard did not campaign on the proposition that the selection of delegates to the people's convention should be used as a pilot for voluntary postal ballots.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Equally, the government has made no case for the use of voluntary postal ballots for testing the waters on matters of national importance. That is the significance. This is a very important matter, despite all the other nonsense we hear in here about public interest and national interest. The shape of our government for the next century is quite clearly one of the most important issues facing this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, you are determined to put this little poisoned pill of voluntary voting in there because you do not want the shape of the government in this next century to be anything like a republic. That is what this is all about. We do not believe you want a convention. We do not believe you want a republic. What is more, we do not believe your disingenuous little assertion on the radio this morning that `this is no Trojan Horse'. Goodness me, this bill is no Trojan Horse for voluntary voting! Senator Abetz has already blown your cover on that one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the record, we also know of the passionate endorsements for voluntary voting you have given during past American and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5856"> New Zealand election campaigns. You have been very quick to leap into print to point out the merits of voluntary voting in all of those and, in some cases, I suppose, to misrepresent voter turnout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said this morning on ABC radio that the Senate would need to vote on changes to the electoral act: `Just let it through this once and, really, the wider electoral act is protected because it has to get through the Senate.' I am afraid that one of the problems with attempting to persuade us to that view is that, to put it delicately, the state of play in relation to the Senate numbers at this moment, in the Democrats' view, means that the merits of arguments for or against the proposition are not the only determinant of the outcome of how the Senate might vote. So do not ask us to be reassured by your saying, `Don't worry, it has to go to a vote of the Senate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that you came in swinging with the same old Senate obstructionism lines this morning. I heard you on both ABC interviews and I counted the number of times and said to myself, `The campaign's beginning; this is biffo No. 1 back on the agenda today.' Whenever things start to look a little bit shaky for you lot, whenever the failure of your economic policies are exposed or whenever we have another debate on unemployment where everybody says, `We don't want more labour market deregulation,' what do you fall back on? Senate obstructionism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very disappointing that you ruled out Senator Bob Brown's plebiscite offer. You said that it was an unreasonable demand for a plebiscite to be held at the next election. You said, `My goodness, this will be three national votes in the space of 12 months!' Obviously, you are inferring that Australians are not capable of doing that, let alone the fact that Americans can cope with 15 or 16 votes simultaneously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a tremendous amount of goodwill in here and in our meetings on this matter in recent days. We have been trying to provide an alternative forum so that the impetus for national debate on our nation's future is not lost. I expected you to disparage our proposal as it stands at the moment&mdash;as a notice of motion today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just another Senate committee&mdash;and let us not say that about Senate committees anyway. We know that there are some that have had a fantastic impact on the legislative history of this country. It is not, as you say, just another Senate committee. This is a committee which has the express responsibility of facilitating the staging of a national debate, utilising the existing mechanisms of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bolkus explained, individuals considered to have some expertise on this issue, irrespective of whether they are for or against the status quo, are invited to express their views at a forum to be determined by this committee. We think one of the options for consideration ought to be, as has been done in other parliaments, particularly in the state parliament of New South Wales, that people address the Senate from a lectern at the front. They can actually say, `These are my views,' and not necessarily be subject to cross-examination. I think the important thing is that their ideas for a possible model for an Australian republic can then form the framework within which a series of public hearings can be staged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can take this debate, as Senator Bolkus said, to every corner of the continent&mdash;that is, into the cities and the regional centres&mdash;and we can ask as many Australians as possible, not just a select few, what they really think about the issues. I think the public hearings process could be informative for those individuals confused about the alternatives available. It could spell out the implications of those alternatives. I think it could result in a much better indication of the Australian mood than any small sample from a Newspoll could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is one fundamental difference between the proposal that we in the non-government parties are trying to work up to put to the Australian people and through the Senate and the government's talkfest. We do not have questionable motives on this. We are not trying to stick a poisoned pill in the middle of it. This is a very simple proposition. We want to facilitate the move to a referendum. We are not seeking dishonestly to put obstacles whenever and wherever we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5857"> can in the way of such a move. Then it will be the job of this committee to recommend to the Senate, based on the evidence they have received, a form of question or questions to be put to the Australian people at a referendum on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we want, is it not? Is that not what we really want to come out of the debate, even out of your convention? But you are requiring some kind of consensus to be reached and then you are going to give us the wonderfully grand gesture of a vote before the end of the century. Thank you very much for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I think about being offered a vote before the end of the century, I say to myself that I hope to goodness it is before the Olympics Games because I do not relish the thought of the Queen or the Prime Minister, John Howard, being the face of Australia for the rest of world in opening the Olympic Games.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell, you speak again. The important issue to come back to is the timing. Why has the government brought this back today? Why have they brought it back at all? Senator Minchin, wearing his other hat, is expecting the native title debate to happen in the Senate in December. That is at a time when we were not meant to be sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: why have you brought it back at a time when it is not a trigger. I think that is wise enough for you. It is not the motive. It is not a reason that you have given all of us. It is not because you want a convention. Nobody believes you. You say the issue of voluntary voting is not important. I say a convention should not be held hostage. You should have been willing to consider a compromise instead of saying the Senate is blocking your legislation. That is not true. The Senate has amended your legislation. It is your government that has been unwilling to walk away and say, `Is it not possible that we could break the nexus, that we could break 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the hostage relationship between the method of voting and the outcome&mdash;the convention?' You were not willing to do that. Your government has not been willing to do that and that is what needs to be injected into consideration in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that we may not have a convention, that we may not be able to go forward and take the republican debate forward via that mechanism. But I agree with Senator Bolkus that you should not be forcing the Senate to choose between the principle of compulsory voting, which has underpinned our democracy for so long in this country, and the opportunity to have a discussion on the nature of a republic in this country. I say shame on your government for behaving so immaturely. I also come to my starting point: this is not about your wanting to have a convention; this is the first phase of your next campaign to build up the mythology of Senate obstructionism.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate that we had the last time we were debating this legislation some points became very clear. Those points were that the preamble, which stated the framework for the constitution convention, was not actually what the government had in mind for the constitutional convention to debate and have an influence over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked questions in relation to the time frame. What if the Constitutional Convention were to say, `We would like to have an indicative plebiscite earlier?' The response from the government&mdash;and Senator Minchin might respond to this&mdash;was, `We will decide when and if that plebiscite takes place.' Basically, the Constitutional Convention was given no power to actually make that decision. One of the three points in the preamble, and a very important one, to the Constitutional Convention&mdash;that is, the time frame and appropriate circumstances for considering change&mdash;the government clearly stated it had not considered doing. They were going to make the decisions when they were good and ready. One out of three points the government had no intention at all of honouring. So the convention was not expected to do what it was listed to do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5858">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues was what republican models should be put to the voter. That could be a range of things; I guess that issue is as wide as it is long. It is not for the cabinet to decide what the Constitutional Convention interprets that as. I suggest that the Constitutional Convention might look at the various elements of constitutional change that might be appropriate to go with any discussion about whether or not Australia progresses to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time Senator Minchin also said, `Well, no, that's not the role of the Constitutional Convention.' So, no, the government does not expect the Constitutional Convention to look at the models that should be put to the voters of Australia; that is, the government does not expect it to look at what kinds of constitutional changes should attend any proposed changes. They said that the government will make decisions on the time frame and that the Constitutional Convention would not be empowered or somehow the government would not be paying attention to them if they looked at any alternative models; that is, if they looked at any wider constitutional changes. That, as far as I can see, would fit into what would be the model for a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it: it is called a constitutional convention, not a `Would you like to be a republic convention?' It is called a constitutional convention. What is left? What is left is whether the present constitution should be changed. Guess what? The Prime Minister said, `If there is a consensus.' It has been set up so there cannot possibly be a consensus. A consensus is a bringing together in one mind. It is a process that means working together to a common end, and that those people who have a different view are prepared to step back. It is not designed to do that. That is three out of three&mdash;you have batted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if what the Senate is being asked to do is vote on a partially flawed model of a constitutional convention. What came out in the debate is that the model is almost totally flawed. Added to that is the very real risk that, in supporting the government's poor offer to the people of Australia, the Senate would potentially be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> used as a vehicle for pushing other changes to the voting system. It is not just about the voting system; it is also about whether or not women will be fairly represented. It is about a whole lot of issues within the Constitutional Convention which certainly make it highly flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to money, if this convention were to take place you would have to say that that amount of money should be spent carefully. You would not put a constitutional convention together and then maybe at some stage if another government came through&mdash;or even the same government rethought the situation and realised that it was acting against the interests of the community&mdash;think, `We'd better do it better this time.' What then could we use to say, `Let's do it properly this time'? You would say, `Oh, we spent $35 plus million on it before; therefore we can only do it the once.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people I know within the wider community who have varying views on this issue. I know within the Greens network there are people who believe that the convention should be progressed. But I also know there are many more people within the network that I speak to who, on the issue of how we are going to advance the constitution of Australia&mdash;that is, our democratic process&mdash;believe that if there is one issue where the means is at least as important as the end, it is how you come to the decisions about your constitution. How can you say, `Let's just be undemocratic,' and hope that the process will turn out to be representative of people's views?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand those in the republican movement who might like to progress this further or who believe that this is the way to progress it. I have a difficulty with those people in the republican movement who believe that part of this process is to control the debate to stop it from widening out. I also believe, however, that this is an opportunity; instead of being rushed into a flawed mickey mouse process which is, by its process, undemocratic, now is the opportunity for the community to claim back the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible for people across Australia to have meetings, to have workshops; for local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5859"> government, perhaps, and for other groups to have meetings and workshops to talk about the issue of what kind of Australia they would like in the next century, what kind of constitutional basis they think is appropriate for Australia in the next century and how they want to relate to their head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, the minimalist approach of simply changing the head of state and then hoping that the rest will all turn out okay is a flawed process. I believe if we have got the chance to do it, we should do it right. It is extremely tempting not to vote on this issue at all, because then the government would be left with a constitutional convention which clearly they do not want. That would mean that they would have to deal with the public's response when, inevitably, they could not totally control the process. But to lead such an important issue into such a flawed process is still a problem that I have difficulty dealing with. I would have to say that the ends that the government has presented do not justify the shoddy means that they are presenting to the Senate in order to achieve an end which is uncertain. Quite clearly&mdash;Senator Brown knows this&mdash;the government has no real intention of advancing the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all three proposals for the forum have turned out to be flawed. The government has no intention of acting on any outcomes on any one of those three proposals. Therefore, at this stage it may well be better for us to go back to the community. The community can kick the proverbial rear end of the government so that they get it right and join with the rest of the community in taking this issue further and debating it further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee by itself, obviously, is no exchange for a full and properly funded process of consultation, but it would open the process up to more of the community than would currently be the situation with both the election and the selection process that is under way. It is my opinion it is not enough. In order to work, it will also have to be associated with a lot more involvement within the community of sharing ideas, empowering other people through information and providing the way forward. I really hope that that will happen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also hope that the republican movement will open that process to bring in the excitement of those people who really do think that we have to not only change the head of state in Australia but also that we should look at what kind of Australia is appropriate in terms of such things as human rights, ecological sustainability as a right of citizenship and the rights of indigenous people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this immense opportunity to talk about those kinds of issues. We have this immense opportunity to talk about the roles of states, including the revenue powers of states and local and federal government. We should not waste this opportunity. Therefore, we should all open out the process to make sure that it is inclusive and that the maximum participation means that the outcome is worthy of Australia and Australia's future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never met him? Well, he was at the meeting. Of course, it was not really a meeting, was it? It was just a family gathering. That is right&mdash;it was a family gathering. I forgot. There you were up in New South Wales not organising a new extreme right wing faction but involved in a family gathering. The only problem is that no&hyphen;one's family was there, including Senator Minchin's. It is only his political family, the broad church of the extreme right wing of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take time off from your family gatherings, what you are saying is you will can the constitutional convention if we, the Labor Party, do not back down on our amendments. We will not, because our amendments are designed to preserve the democratic traditions of this nation. It is the best electoral system in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time we were here debating this legislation I acknowledged, generously, that the holding of the constitutional convention was a Howard pre-election pledge. I did say that it was an unusual pledge because it was one of the few that Mr Howard had made that he intended to honour. But, of course, like so many of Mr Howard's promises, it is one that he was really ready to ditch once the going got tough. He is now backing away from the constitutional convention with a simple threat: he will not hold it unless the Senate backs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down on its position of principle and compromises on the issue of a voluntary postal ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals in this bill include a massive change from compulsory to voluntary voting, holding a postal ballot, not an attendance ballot, and a change to optional and preferential voting, all of which I believe are of great significance to the Australian electorate. But not one of them was ever canvassed by the coalition parties before the election. They were certainly not part of Mr Howard's promise to the Australian people at the last election. It was the secret agenda of Mr Howard, Senator Minchin and the mainstream faction of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to be very clear on this. Our amendments do not prevent the Constitutional Convention from proceeding. We have always said that we at least respect the fact that the convention is the preferred vehicle for the government to progress the debate on the republic. However, what we have done and what we will not back down on is our commitment to ensure that the ballot is a compulsory attendance secret ballot to ensure that the system of voting is simplified so it is as straightforward, as accessible, as democratic, as well understood and as simple as is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Mr Howard and Senator Minchin are on the record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 5 May stating that they `won't be budged' from the proposed voluntary ballot and that it was `non&hyphen;negotiable'. Likewise, the Labor Party, the opposition, will not be budged on these issues. Likewise, these issues are non&hyphen;negotiable as far as Labor is concerned. The real agenda of the Liberals has always been very transparent. They have always been committed to undermining our democratic process by abolishing compulsory voting in favour of a voluntary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that a voluntary system would further alienate the disadvantaged and the disaffected from the political process. I will not go through the arguments that I outlined at length when this matter was previously debated in the Senate. I believe I went through them very thoroughly before and those views are firmly on the record. Suffice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5861"> to say, Mr Howard and Senator Minchin's real agenda is clear: they do not want a convention. They do not want a republic. They have tried to spike this convention with their electoral experiments in the knowledge that the Senate would not be likely to support them. Of course, the underhand way that they have manipulated this legislative process is proof of their commitment to changing Australia's electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to a matter raised by Senator Minchin in his contribution. I was most interested to see the true Liberal agenda come out via the press release from Senator Abetz. For the information of anyone who might be listening to this broadcast day in the Senate, let me explain who Senator Abetz is. He would not be well known. It is Senator Eric Abetz from the state of Tasmania. I hope that explains who he is. Senator Boswell did not know either, but there are a lot of listeners who would not have heard of him, I can assure you, Senator Boswell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Eric Abetz put out a press release demonstrating for the first time on his part not only some real political insight but also the true Liberal Party agenda. Fancy him being honest enough to actually confirm what Mr Howard and Senator Minchin were really on about before this debate was about to occur in the Senate! This is what he actually said. Let me quote Senator Eric Abetz, Liberal, Tasmania. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reported Democrat backflip on the constitutional convention is a major boost to trialling voluntary voting on a national basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thank you, Senator Abetz. Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Democrats do support the constitutional convention they will allow a significant voluntary voting project to be undertaken and I look forward to that prospect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thank you again, Senator Abetz. It is a set&hyphen;up. The Liberals are using this election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention to attack the integrity of Australia's electoral system. But we will not back away from the Australian way of voting. We will not back away from the Australian ballot, which has traditionally been a compulsory attendance secret ballot. We will never accept the perver 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion of our electoral system, which is an electoral system that I think the vast majority of Australians are proud of and rightly regard as the best in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is shameful to see people like Senator Boswell and his colleagues from the National Party conned by this. The National Party do not support voluntary voting, do you, Senator Boswell? No. You do not support postal ballots for elections, do you, Senator Boswell? No.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but you support this because you have been conned, Senator Boswell. You have been conned again. The National Party is rolling over on what hitherto has been a fundamental principle that that party has signed up to. It is weakness on the part of the National Party, and it is pathetic on behalf of the constituency they claim to represent. We will do everything to ensure that the convention just does not become a device for Mr Howard and Senator Minchin to smother a republic and to rort our electoral system. We have taken the first step along the way by amending this legislation to make the ballot for delegates to the convention a ballot in the tried and true Australian tradition, which is a compulsory attendance ballot. We are not going to back away from that now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make some reference to the feeble defence that the government has put to the parliament that the voluntary postal ballot is a more cost&hyphen;effective way of electing delegates to the convention. Our response to that weak and pathetic excuse is simple: the cost of democracy has never before been an issue in this country. It should not be one now. You cannot compromise the democratic process on the basis of cost. What price does the Liberal Party put on democracy? In this context it is a measly $13 million at the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say to the government: whatever the difference is between the cost of a compulsory attendance ballot and a voluntary postal ballot, whether it is $13 million or it is less, the integrity of our electoral system is worth the money. There is no defence, budgetary or otherwise, for the government's proposed voluntary postal ballot. It can be justified only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5862"> in terms of the government's lack of commitment to a republic, lack of commitment to their own Constitutional Convention and desire to fundamentally change our electoral system for their own political advantage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have compared it to the first generation copy provided to agencies for consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I noted a number of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the Opposition's copy carried defects which I am able to say are "fingerprint" characteristics of the drum of the photocopier used to make previous generations of the copy. Also, the photocopied staple marks on the copy of the letter appear in a different position to that on the Cabinet file master copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, the Rann document was not derived from the same master as the documents that went out to Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 June I examined a copy of the submission in the departmental working file. That file was the basis for consultation with other departments and the Prudential Management Group and later reconsideration of the proposal for the EDS building by Treasury and myself, ie it was the document which went out to the agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The copy in the departmental working file bore the same characteristics as the copy provided to the media by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From that, I infer that the Rann document comes from someone who has copied an agency consultation copy&mdash;being a copy which would not have been able to be accessed by John Olsen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made a copy of the master copy which is the source of Ministers' copies on the Cabinet Office photocopier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was not able to reproduce the characteristic defects.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5867"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, I came back to the State Administration Centre 14th floor photocopier, which I am able to say is the machine used for distribution of Cabinet papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I receive copies of all Cabinet submissions produced in the same run as Ministers' photocopies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was overseas at the time this particular matter went before Cabinet, ie on 23&hyphen;24 October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to check my findings, I examined a photocopy of another submission produced by the Cabinet Office in late September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, it did not have the defects of the Rann photocopy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My department and I are very security conscious.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I saw the Rann document, I knew straight away which floor of the State Administration Centre and which machine it had been produced on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recognised the characteristic defect as emanating from a photocopier on the 13th floor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was then used by the Project Co-ordination Division of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff working in that area at the time were working on the EDS proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other functions of this department and Treasury on the 13th floor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot say how many people may have had access to the photocopier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am unable to say who made the photocopies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am however, from my knowledge of Cabinet procedures, able to say that John Olsen could not have made that copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as l am aware, he has never accessed a photocopier on the 13th floor himself, and it would be most unusual and memorable if a Minister did so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, for security reasons he would not have been able to access the 13th floor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am able to say that other photocopies within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet files have the same "fingerprint" characteristics as the material provided to the media by Mr Rann, ie other copies in the files which were made on the 13th floor machine have the same defect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The probability that a copier in a Minister's Office would have the same random defect on its drum is infinitesimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not even remotely possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, in any case the staple holes in the copy of the letter would have been in a different position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I have no doubt that the Rann photocopy and the attached letter was derived from a copy made in the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. It was not made from a first generation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> copy made by the Cabinet Office for distribution to Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am able to say that at least five departments had copies for consultation purposes. Accordingly, the likelihood is that the material received and distributed by Mr Rann was provided by a government officer, not a Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to expand on the remarks I made yesterday in the urgency debate regarding schools and literacy. As all senators will now be aware, our two ministers for education&mdash;echoing complaints made from time to time by disgruntled employer groups&mdash;are back on the bandwagon of literacy or, should I say, the lack of it in government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This began with Dr Kemp's pronouncement late last year that one-third of year 9 students could not read&mdash;something which has now been said by him so often that it has become the truth for many people. He took for his evidence the results of a test for something quite different; that is, a very small section of a longitudinal 20-year study of the transition from school to work, in which a complex question of comprehension was put to students. Senators may recall that the journalist who wrote the piece on which the test was based failed the test according to the examiner's interpretation of the meaning. I keep raising this matter because the minister continues to mislead parents by repeating his remarks over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now Senator Vanstone has joined in the fray, and she too proclaims that literacy is of great concern to this government. Literacy ought to be of concern to the government. Every effort should be made to see that all students have the most basic skills in literacy by their very early primary years. Unfortunately, concern is not enough. A nine per cent reduction in real terms in spending on literacy is not enough. A nationwide campaign to test students is also not enough. In fact, wholesale testing is not only ineffective in improving 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5868"> literacy but it also has the potential to do more harm than good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The harm that I refer to is that the government will use the results of that data in its ongoing campaign to shift students from government to private schools or, as the minister says, she `wants to focus a spotlight on areas where they'&mdash;that is, government schools&mdash;`can do better'. I would like to contrast the government's `bleed them dry then test how they cope' mentality with what the educators are saying tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost 12 months ago, the Australian Literacy Educators Association produced what was titled `A strategy plan for successful literacy learning'. This organisation is made up of members of all levels of education and from different education systems. The plan outlines 10 key recommendations. Of course, it may come as a surprise to the government that none of these is about testing and none of them is about competition between schools and any of the other nonsense that we hear about from our education ministers when they discuss the matter of literacy. In the preface of the strategy plan, the association says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is no evidence to support the commonly expressed view that there has been a decline in literacy standards in Australia, literacy educators must not be complacent for the highly technological society in which we live demands or requires more sophisticated skills.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The association goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that high standards of literacy are necessary for today's students to meet the literacy requirements for our present society as well as for the future. Changes in technology and society have altered and will continue to alter the ways in which we use language to communicate and to think. Students must be prepared to meet these demands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the act of setting high standards, by itself, cannot erase the impact of poverty, ethnic or cultural discrimination, low levels of family literacy, and social and political disenfranchisement. We must ensure that all students have equal opportunities to learn that inequities in school resources are addressed, that schools have an adequate number of knowledgeable teachers, and that we provide safe and supportive environments for learning.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Literacy involves the construction and interpretation of meaning for a range of purposes. Meaning has to be at the centre of any literacy program.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The association's first recommendation is that a major literacy promotion campaign through commercial television targets parents and carers of pre-school students, highlighting the importance of their role in supporting early and on&hyphen;going literacy development. It should be understood that literacy learning begins a long time before formal schooling. Studies have shown that if families can share books with babies as young as six to nine months of age, then these children will show positive literacy outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation is the development of a home education literacy program. This would target new parents and would focus on talking with and to children, singing, chanting rhymes and jingles, sharing reading and enjoying books with children. The program, they say, could be run through maternal and child health centres, libraries and communities centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The association suggests the appointment of pre&hyphen;school literacy officers attached to community service centres to assist in the administration and development of the program. Very high on the list of priorities for the association is a well resourced local library. Most communities already have a good local library, but many do not. Of course, remote rural areas are the places where we find very low retention rates. A number of inquiries and reports, and their recommendations, have already been made. Now, says the association, is the time for a firm policy to be articulated to ensure that there is increased provision for literacy education in all pre&hyphen;service education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The association points out that over the last four years there have been dramatic reductions in the time allocations for pre&hyphen;service education courses in the areas of language and literacy education. It says that early childhood, primary and secondary teacher education should include compulsory language education units. Their recommendation No. 6 is that all primary teacher education programs should include compulsory units on early literacy learning, in addition to other language 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5869"> education units. They suggest that on&hyphen;going professional development in literacy education should be compulsory for all teachers so they remain informed about literacy research and practices and can translate these into classroom practice. The association points out that many teachers have been in the service for a long time and there is a need for them to keep abreast of current research, theory and current practices, and the significant changes which have taken place over the last 10 years in literacy education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their recommendation No. 8 relates to support for programs. There should be a network of locally based language and literacy specialists to support teachers in improving their classroom teaching, as well as curriculum support guidelines and materials that reflect current research and practices in teaching and learning. Of course, funding should be made available to assure small class sizes at least in the early years. Funds are also needed to ensure that classrooms and school libraries can continue to provide children with contemporary Australian books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their recommendation No. 9 is that schools should be supported and encouraged to develop agreed school policies and programs which prioritise literacy, and develop plans to have experienced teachers with specialist qualifications in literacy; to maintain well stocked school and classroom libraries; to provide access to classroom based computers and materials for classroom reading, writing and spelling activities; and, finally, to ensure that curriculum evaluation procedures match individual school policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I raise this strategy plan tonight and give it to the Senate in some detail is because I want to point out that the government has put in place none of these recommendations. I did not notice anywhere in that strategy document the requirement that all students be tested and the results made public. I detected no sense of blame because schools and teachers have not tried hard enough, or have not been competitive enough, or efficient enough. This is a plan of action&mdash;a positive contribution towards improving literacy in our schools. The government has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had this plan for almost a year and has managed to ignore it totally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee will commence its inquiry into the status of teachers this Friday and I want to tell senators that it is my earnest hope that, although the government has not listened to this advice and the advice, no doubt, that it has been given from other sources since it came to office, the evidence which might come before that committee perhaps will lend weight to that advice. It is my hope that our two education ministers will put aside their rhetoric and their attacks on schools, and on teachers and learn to take better care of the education of children in this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5869"><TITLE>South Australia: Leader of the Opposition</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The copies of Cabinet Submissions which are distributed to Ministers each have characteristics which make them identifiable as Ministers' copies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That does not apply to those draft submissions which are distributed to agencies for comment. In the case of the Rann photocopy, I am able to say that it was not a Ministerial copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also add that the Rann photocopy had in the top left hand corner a dark patch, ie when the document was photocopied, someone had turned over a page.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That does not appear on Ministerial copies of Cabinet Submissions, because they are prepared on an automatic collating machine which photocopies the single sheets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Cabinet meeting procedure, the Cabinet Submissions are distributed to Ministers in a locked case, to which the Minister has a key.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Cabinet, all Submissions are placed in the centre of the table after discussion, ie handed back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a Minister did not attend a meeting, the likelihood is they would not even have read the documents or unlocked the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, the Cabinet Submissions would normally be returned, ie John Olsen would have returned the papers in the Cabinet bag and placed them on the table for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot guarantee that occurred, but that is ordinary practice. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5870"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I can say is that the Cabinet Submission copy sent to John Olsen's Office is not the document identified to me as having been released by Mike Rann.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can also say from my experience in working in government that there can be many and multiple sources of leaks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaks from government are not uncommon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no reason to believe that John Olsen leaked the material at all, and every reason to believe that he did not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the water contract material that Mike Rann claims to have received, the only material I am aware of is that tabled by John Olsen in Parliament, being material which came from a filing cabinet of Richard Yeeles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That cabinet was located in the Premier's Office on the 15th floor of the State Administration Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the Premier's personal staff, myself and my deputy have access to the Premier's suite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, John Olsen would not have had access to that filing cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Richard Yeeles left the Premier's office before the change of Premiers. Dean Brown kept the filing cabinet after he ceased to be Premier. He took it with him to his new office at 45 Pirie Street. That is, John Olsen never had access to that filing cabinet, although he of course had access to the documents themselves, as he was the Minister responsible for overseeing the contract. I would find it extremely surprising that John Olsen would want to leak material about his own contract.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, most interestingly, the fact that Mike Rann has named Mr Kevin Foley, a political colleague, means that Mr Foley himself will be called before the court to give evidence in this matter. That means that he will be subject to cross-examination. What an interesting twist! Machiavelli would be proud of Mr Rann doing all that he can to make sure that Mr Foley does not succeed Mr Rann when the inevitable election is held very soon now. Mr Foley's clean skin image as Mr Clean, ready to take over the leadership, will be substantially dented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two reasons for Mike Rann setting up his colleague, Mr Foley. The first, as I have just said, is to make sure that he shores up his own position following the election, and the second is to clear the path for his old friend, John Hill. So the damaged Mr Foley will have no chance of taking on the leadership, clearing a path for John Hill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, of course, he can make way for his other close and dear friend, Trish White. Kevin Foley has been running around bragging about a Kirribilli agreement, a pact, that he has the numbers to put Rann out two years after the election. Ralph Clark, the current Deputy Leader, does not even have a vote on the floor of their convention, which highlights the division within that party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So stand by for Trish White. Trish White has taken the seat of the former South Australian Premier, Lyn Arnold. Everybody on our side has watched her progress with great interest, and I have no doubt that she, along with John Hill, waits patiently in the wings.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5870"><TITLE>Fitzroy River: Proposed Dam</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to reply to Senator Murray's recent adjournment debate speech on the proposal to dam the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. I would like to provide evidence to the Senate and place on record that the damming of the Fitzroy River could well deliver strong economic growth to the region. Contrary to what Senator Murray stated in his adjournment debate speech, the damming of the Fitzroy means that significant net benefits most certainly could be achieved. The West Kimberley has the prospect of becoming an Australian food and fibre powerhouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I would like to provide the Senate with some background information on the Fitzroy River. The catchment area of the Fitzroy is bigger than Victoria and, in flood, the volume of water from the Fitzroy is second only to the Amazon. In fact, it would fill Sydney Harbour in three and a half hours. However, at present the water resource of the Fitzroy is neither harvested nor utilised and, if used, this area would become a diverse agricultural production zone that would provide solid opportunities for food and fibre crops and generate at least $900 million in exports per year. This of course means jobs and new small business opportunities for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray asserted that no appraisal is being undertaken into the environmental, social and long&hyphen;term economic wellbeing of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5871"> the region. I would like to place on record in the Senate that this statement is totally untrue and unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a widely advertised invitation for expressions of interest, the state government of Western Australia on 29 July 1997 announced the appointment of Western Agricultural Industries Pty Ltd&mdash;I will refer to them as WAI in the rest of this speech&mdash;as the preferred proponent to carry out an environmental impact statement and feasibility study into the West Kimberley land and water resource development proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">WAI is an Australian company comprising Queensland Cotton Holdings and Kimberley Agricultural lndustries&mdash;both proprietary limited companies&mdash;and they will start their feasibility study into the damming of the Fitzroy in approximately two months time. That study is expected to take two years for completion. WAI will study all aspects of the planned project, including flora, fauna, hydrology, environment, heritage, culture and social impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">WAI has recently completed a six-year pre-feasibility study of the Fitzroy River and the West Kimberley area. It is WAI's plan to harvest 25 per cent of the annual flow of the Fitzroy River and leave 75 per cent for environmental use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">WAI states that broad community participation will be sought in the problem solving and decision making process with regard to the damming of the Fitzroy, and this will be brought about by one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one meetings, discussion groups, workshops, speaking engagements and telephone surveys as required. WAI studies will provide evidence that economic growth will be generated from the damming of the Fitzroy River and that significant net benefits will be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trials of cotton and other crops, in conjunction with CSIRO and Agriculture WA will continue to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of fibre and food crops using bore water for irrigation. An aquifer south of Broome will be investigated to define annual sustainable water yield levels, and this will form the basis of a pilot project to prove the economic viability of the next possible stage of the project, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would involve construction of a water storage dam. A very important point to make is that no decision can be made on the likely site of any dam or dams until the feasibility study has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full development of this project is estimated to take 10 to 15 years and will involve an area estimated to be 225,000 hectares. The initial crop will be cotton, which has existing market opportunities in which Australia holds an internationally competitive position as the fourth largest cotton exporting country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Service in Japan with BCOF does not fulfil the requirements for qualifying service. Occurring after the formal surrender of Japan and facing no opposition to their presence in the country, the occupation forces did not incur danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The operations undertaken by the occupation forces in Japan were not warlike in nature and can be better equated to the current concept of non&hyphen;warlike service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to Senator Bourne's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There are unconfirmed reports that police fired some shots from handguns during a demonstration outside the Mahkota Hotel in Dili on 23 March 1997. The International Committee of the Red Cross has informed officers from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta that it was very likely that shots&mdash;probably fewer than 10&mdash;had been fired from handguns. The East Timor Roman Catholic Church's Commission on Justice and Peace said that they believed the police had used "simulated bullets".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Neither the ICRC nor the Commission on Justice and Peace have confirmed any deaths resulting from the incident. Information supplied to officers from our Embassy in Jakarta during a visit to East Timor from 6&hyphen;12 April suggests that approximately 29 people were treated for various injuries at the Motael Church clinic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) An Amnesty International report of 26 March 1997 stated that 45 people were arrested following the incident, of which 24 remained in custody at the time of the report. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta has been advised that 33 persons have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charged following the incident and are currently in detention awaiting trial. The case is likely to be heard by the beginning of August 1997. All the defendants are being represented by the Yayasan Lembaga Bantuan Hukum (an Indonesian legal aid foundation) which Australia has funded from the Human Rights Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) The Government has and continues to urge the Indonesian authorities to ensure that those detained be given their full rights and due process under the law and be treated in accordance with international human rights standards. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, raised the human rights situation in East Timor at his latest meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas in Hong Kong on 30 June. He also discussed the East Timor situation, in light of the incident at the Mahkota Hotel, with East Timor Governor Abilio Soares when he met him in Ambon on 24 April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In addition to the Minister's raising of these issues with the Indonesians the Government has asked our Embassy in Jakarta to take up this matter. Officers from the Embassy subsequently raised the issue with various officials and independent human rights observers in East Timor, during a visit in April 1997. The Embassy officers specifically raised Australian Government concerns regarding violence against demonstrators and suspects in the Mahkota Hotel incident. They also raised general human rights concerns in East Timor. These concerns were raised with a number of officials including the military command in Dili, the Police Chief, the Chief Prosecutor, the Komnas Ham (Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights) and the local leadership (civil and military) in Aileu, Baucau and Viqueque Kabupatens.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that these answers were provided by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and that the statistics are as at 8 July 1997. I am further advised that, unless the contrary intention appears, for the purpose of all answers concerning complaints/inquiries under the Federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA), "inquiry" has been interpreted to mean the public inquiry that is held after a notice referred to in section 63 of the SDA is issued. Similarly, for the purpose of all answers concerning complaints/ inquiries under the Federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (the RDA), "inquiry" has been interpreted to mean the public inquiry that is held after a notice referred to in section 25E of the RDA is issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) How many inquiries into complaints referred to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner have been held since 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) There have been 141 inquiries into 223 complaints where the inquiry has been completed and a decision handed down.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) How many inquiries have been held into:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) complaints of indirect sex discrimination, (b) complaints of direct sex discrimination, (c) complaints of direct discrimination because of a characteristic imputed to or pertaining to the sex of the aggrieved person, (d) complaints of non-intentional direct sex discrimination that was subconscious or systemic in nature; and (e) complaints of sexual harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purpose of this answer, "inquiries" is defined as public inquiries that have been held and completed and includes those where a decision has been handed down and those that are awaiting decision. Below each set of statistics are figures from 1994 onwards for those inquiries that were commenced in relation to each category but not completed (that is, the complaint settled or was withdrawn sometime after the first day of public inquiry).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been assumed from the manner in which questions (a) to (d) are worded above that the term "sex discrimination" is used to refer to

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that the statistics provided below do not incorporate complaints of sexual harassment into the answers to questions (a) to (d) even though sexual harassment is itself a form of sex discrimination.

However, where an inquiry considered a complaint of sexual harassment as well as a separate complaint of sex discrimination (for example that the complainant was unlawfully dismissed) the separate complaint of sex discrimination has been included in the statistics given in relation to questions (a) to (d) as well as the sexual harassment complaint being included in the statistics in response to question (e).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, it should be noted that one inquiry can be held into multiple complaints by the complainant(s) against the respondent(s) in relation to a particular fact situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, in answering the questions, it is assumed that the reference to "direct sex discrimination" is a reference to complaints made under subsections 5(1),6(1) and 7(1) and that the reference to "indirect discrimination" refers to complaints made under subsections 5(2), 6(2) and 7(2) of the SDA.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SDA does not refer to "systemic discrimination". The term is generally used to refer to situations in which a complex of directly and/or indirectly discriminatory practices operate to produce general disadvantage to persons in the same

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Government is aware of the Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq. Our relevant Missions including those in Ankara and at the United Nations, New York, have kept the Government informed of developments. Turkey has acknowledged that as many as 50,000 troops crossed the border in an operation directed against guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) which has been waging an insurgency in support of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5883"> a separate Kurdish State since 1984. Turkish authorities have indicated that most of the forces have been recalled but the operation seems likely to continue for several more weeks at least. The media has not been allowed into operational areas and objective and independent reporting has not been possible. The Turkish operation is being conducted jointly with one of the main Kurdish factions established in northern Iraq&mdash;the Kurdistan Democatic Party (KDP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia has taken a consistent position regarding Turkish incursions into northern Iraq, the previous major intervention against the PKK having taken place in March 1995. Because the PKK is a terrorist organisation which is a threat to Turkey's security and has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, its actions cannot be condoned. At the same time Australia respects the sovereignty of Iraq and has noted Turkey's claims that it respects the sovereignty of Iraq's territory. Australia has consistently urged Turkey to limit any such operations against the PKK only to what is required to guarantee its security and with respect for human rights and the well&hyphen;being of the civilian population. The Australian Government expects Turkey to withdraw as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government is aware of the claims, principally by supporters of the PKK, of widespread and systemic abuse. The situation on the ground is not clear, but the Government is not aware of any substantiated evidence to support such claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Turkish ground forces have been backed by artillery, heavy armour and air support. The Turkish General Staff said that it had targeted and successfully attacked a number of identified PKK bases and strongholds, and that as many as three thousand guerillas and PKK supporters had been killed or captured and that others have fled across the border into Iran and Syria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) A number of countries, including Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have criticised the intervention. Iraq lodged a formal protest claiming that Turkey had violated Iraqi sovereignty and called for an immediate withdrawal. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and France, have urged Turkey to keep its actions to within acceptable limits and to respect human rights. The United States has acknowledged Turkey's right to defend itself against a vicious terrorist organisation and accepted Turkish assurances that the operation had a limited scope and that Turkey would withdraw once it had achieved its objectives. UN Secretary General Annan has urged Turkey to withdraw as soon as possible. We understand that most of the Turkish objectives have been achieved and only a small contingent remains in northern Iraq in support of the KDP. Australia supports an early withdrawal by Turkey from Iraq. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> At the same time, while Australia deplores any actions of the Turkish Government which fall short of internationally accepted standards of human rights and behaviour, it also condemns the actions of organisations, such as the PKK, which have resorted to terrorism and violence to achieve an independent Kurdistan.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware of instances where universities arrange deferred repayment back loans for the costs associated with the flying training component of aviation courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements have been created because the Commonwealth does not (nor has it ever) provided funding to higher education institutions to cover the cost of pilot training. The Commonwealth has taken this view on the basis that the costs associated with obtaining a pilot's license and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undertaking of practical flying training should be born by individuals, not taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, HECS liable and non&hyphen;fee paying HECS exempt students must be able to complete their chosen award without facing course related charges imposed by their higher education institution. Universities may not, therefore, charge fees for units which are compulsory parts of HECS liable courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under some circumstances, however, a student may be charged fees for units which would give credit towards a course, as long as the student can choose to complete the course without undertaking those units. This is the basis on which institutions are able to charge fees for the costs associated with obtaining a pilot's license and the undertaking of practical flying training. My Department is in the process of formally writing to the universities involved in the provision of aviation courses to confirm that these courses comply with these provisions of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Actual Means Test (AMT) all expenditure and savings are included in a family's actual means except those related to the main business activity of the family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The response to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural families receive special consideration under the Actual Means test. For example, Sole Trader Primary Producers and families in receipt of Drought Relief Payment or Farm Household Support payments are exempted from the AUSTUDY Actual Means Test. Isolated families also receive a discount off their actual means when in receipt of the isolated boarders' concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the Actual Means Test, loans fall into two categories. For loans for the principal family home, other real estate expenditure and motor vehicles, the purchase price should not be included in estimated expenditure in the current year. Repayments of principal and interest in the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">current year should be included in expenditure estimates. For loans for other items, the outlay only should be reported as estimated expenditure in the current year. Repayment of principal and interest should not be reported as expenditure. Neither business expenditure, including business loans, or business assets are counted in the Actual Means Test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Actual Means Test is an estimate of expenditure for the year of study and therefore it is sensitive to fluctuations in a family's current financial situation. The Actual Means Test like the AUSTUDY Income Test allows the family whose circumstances change within the year of study to have their eligibility and level of entitlement re&hyphen;assessed at any time throughout the year of study.</PARA>
