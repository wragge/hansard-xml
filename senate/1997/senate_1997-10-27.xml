<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we left the debate at the end of the last sitting week Senator Margetts had moved her amendment. The government indicates that it will be opposed to this and other amendments. We believe that the amendments go to a significant policy issue and are well outside the technical nature of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, the amendments would have the effect of encouraging employees to engage in industrial action involving bans and limitations knowing that they could pressure their employers to paying them, irrespective of the effects of the action on their employers' businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments would allow employees to be paid even if they impose bans on critical elements of their work and their employers' businesses, simply because particular tasks in relation to which bans have been imposed happen to involve little actual working time. This is precisely the type of damaging conduct that the government's legislation is designed to discourage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no compulsion in the relation to industrial relations in the sense that, if a person conducts some form of industrial action, their employer cannot take some sort of the action in relation to their pay. All this section does is remove the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compulsion to dock pay from employers. We know that Senator Murray's proposed amendment goes part of way towards that, because he specifically mentions those elements of industrial action where the employer accepts or even approves of the action and some of it can go to workers' health and safety and other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in hospitals, schools, universities or areas where there is a great deal of dedication there is a desire not to push for industrial strike action or work to rule. Those dedicated people who serve the community would prefer to make their point in a way that is not overly harmful to their jobs. These amendments will enable them to make their point and put some pressure for negotiation and arbitration into place. That is a very useful thing more many people to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would prefer there to be full industrial action. We are trying to indicate that it should not be compulsory for employers to dock the pay of people who work to rule. It is still open, of course, for employers to do that. There is nothing that indicates that it will be illegal for them to issue warnings or something of that nature. There is nothing that I can see that would make it illegal for there to be pay deductions, if work to rule were to be a problem for them. However, all it says is that it is not compulsory for employers to exempt that level of compulsion from employees for something that might be as simple as work to rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With teachers it could be something as simple as them saying that they will refuse over a certain period to take excursions. Teachers may say that they will work to rule in non&hyphen;contact hours or non&hyphen;school hours and not take the kids away, but they might not actually be doing anything in their paid work time that is a problem. They might be doing everything in their full day, but when it comes to the normal expectation for teachers to do things in their own time, they may say, `You are not listening to us, so for this period of time we are not going to put in that extra effort in our own time.' That may well be considered to be work to rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, why should someone have to dock someone's pay in those circumstances? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8038"> It does not make sense. I believe it will mean that there will be more industrial action rather than less. It is a thoroughly sensible approach to say that work to rule should not be all lumped in to any kind of industrial action. There may be limited industrial actions for workers' health and safety. We know that the government has peeled back a lot of the protections for workers' health and safety and this might be one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This specific work to rule provision may be one way&mdash;or it might be the only way&mdash;a workplace has of bringing home those points. We have proven in the 1996 legislation that there are limitations on the other kinds of industrial action that can be taken in relation to unsafe working conditions. The government has not allowed them into the allowable matters in awards and, if a person refuses to work in a specific job, only the person in that specific area is allowed to refuse to work in that specific job. There might be other ways in which workers can actually save their own lives, for instance, by giving a very subtle or not so subtle message in some form of work to rule campaign. It is only fair to simply remove the compulsion of an employer to dock pay under these circumstances.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Margetts is right. It is an extraordinary business when two people who are negotiating over the table cannot agree on what people will be paid or whether they will be remunerated in particular circumstances. If the workplace reform is based upon the idea of contract, equal parties negotiating, we on this side of the chamber say that they are not equal parties, and that therefore there should be&mdash;as there is under the Trade Practices Act, for example, where people are at a disadvantage&mdash;a means of evening up. But where the basis of the Workplace Relations Act is that parties should be able to agree about what happens, to be prohibited from agreeing in a circumstance where industrial action takes place is terrible and seems to be, as Senator Margetts says, inconsistent with the philosophy behind the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went to the people on the basis that it was going to introduce a new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> philosophy, a new program, into the workplace where there would be exchanges between the parties, and that the unions and everybody else would be excluded except for those negotiating. Yet the government itself intervenes in one of the crucial areas where one would have thought the issue of privity contract might operate, where people might want to agree to pay in particular circumstances. In a situation where there has been industrial action, where people have been on strike for example, why shouldn't the parties as a means of negotiating a settlement use that privity contract without interference from government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer would understand that this is big government at its worst. It is an awful thing to see a government come in and interfere with private enterprise in the way they are doing here. I must confess that it comes as a bit of a shock to find that Senator Campbell, Senator Parer and Senator Calvert should be party to this interference by big government in the marketplace.</PARA></SPEECH>

I did not seek to delay the committee's consideration of the bill by spending another five, six or seven minutes in calling for a division.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the assistance of senators. I want to return to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary. It is not entirely true that Senator Margetts's amendment was anything other than materially technical because there is a question of the intention of the new act as moved.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly I never intended a situation to arise where, if employers genuinely, individually, personally wished to&mdash;not forced to&mdash;continue to pay employees when they were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taking limited action, they should be prevented or in any way pressured not to do so. The converse is the case. We do strongly support the intention of the act to prevent employees being paid when they are on strike. But this is not about people being on strike; this is about people doing a full day's work, the employer being prepared to accept it and the people being paid for it. That particularly applies, and quite frankly is in the interest of the country, when you are dealing with such areas as essential services. I would always personally encourage nurses, or police officers or those sorts of people to take limited action rather than to strike and withdraw their labour completely, because of the harm that can cause to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the act does pick up as a strike any performance of work which is different from how it is customarily performed. But the employer under the law is obliged, it seems, not to pay them. We had thought that there was common law protection in that area. When we dealt with the legislation, the government placed great emphasis on the rider to the definition of industrial action in section 4, which says, `An employer is not engaged in industrial action if the employee's action is agreed to by the employer.' You would think `agreed to' would mean acceptance by the employer of the work that was being performed. It is for this reason, Parliamentary Secretary, and I appreciate there is a difference of opinion between you and us, that we regard this as an interpretative matter arising out of the original intention of the act and not a new matter being introduced. That is why I say that, whilst it is material, we still consider it to be technical. If we turn to our amendment, we see that it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purpose of this Part, industrial action does not include action by employees that is authorised, agreed to or accepted by the employer of the employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You need to have consideration as to what those words mean. `Authorised' has to be in some formal or identifiable manner that which has been authorised, and `agreed to' would have the same meaning. You then have to ask, `Where does "accepted by" take us with this? How does it add to the definition we put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8040"> there?' We put that in deliberately in case `authorised' or `agreed to' was historically based&mdash;in other words, it was contractually based or in some way based on agreements in the past where `accepted' means `accepted at the time'. So if nurses, to give an example, take limited action and that is accepted by the employer, then our view is that the employer should, if they wish to, pay them and should not be obliged by direction from the government not to pay them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It most affects employers where the relevant department or relevant minister may take a hard line and resist paying people who embark on some kind of limited action, such as work to rule. We have moved the amendment to try to ensure that the definition of industrial action, for the purposes of the act, does not include action which is accepted of their own volition, of their own free will, not in any standover or forced manner, by the employer of the employees. I think Senator Margetts gave a fuller motivation for these kinds of considerations, so I will not indulge the committee's time any further by motivating any more than she has with my additional remarks.</PARA></SPEECH>

I will not hold up the committee much longer, because the arguments are fundamentally the same. We do believe, Senator Murray, that they are in fact material, not materially technical; but I will not get too technical about the definitions of what is material and what is technical. They do make a quite fundamental change in the interpretation and application of that part of the law. We do believe that the government's intent, our pre-election policy, our post-election policy and our continuing policy in relation to the use of work bans and work to rules has been implemented as intended in this legislation and this will materially change it. We do regard it as a serious

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a rather bizarre kind of explanation by the parliamentary secretary, first of all indicating that some how or other the Senate has no place to be moving such amendments in a `technical' bill. It is not; it is called the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. If the government is claiming that it is tidying up issues associated with the workplace relations bill, so are we. If the parliamentary secretary recalls, he will know that during the debate in 1996 it was not clearly known by the minister at the time what was meant by the definition of industrial relations for the purpose of the act. We had to go questioning backwards and forwards before we found out that it really was intended, supposedly, by the government to actually lump all kinds of industrial action into this very restrictive section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the code that Senator Campbell is making to Senator Murray is that this was part of the original agreement. I do clearly recall Senator Murray saying at the time that it was not part of their original understanding of the bill. That is why I am pleased to see the Australian Democrats have changed their position in relation to that. If that had been made clear at the time, if the government had been clear enough perhaps even to the Democrats in their negotiations at that time, it may never have been voted for or been part of any negotiation at the time. But unfortunately it was, so now is the time&mdash;it is the first opportunity that we are both using, I guess&mdash;to rectify an unfortunate situation regarding something that was at the time a technical clarification which I and many others believe was an abuse of the definition of `industrial action'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some ways this is a technical clarification as well going back to perhaps what it should always have been; that is, that you do not get ham&hyphen;fisted in relation to penalising people. It does not help in relation to industrial action. The suggestion that somehow or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8041"> other you called a bill something and nobody else can make their own changes to definitions within the process of debate is bizarre.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I have moved this amendment because I, on behalf of the Australian Greens, have continued to have the concern that the legislation as amended will potentially penalise a whole range of community groups, including unions, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Australia if they undertake secondary boycott action or what appears to be secondary boycott action in the interests of social justice, consumer protection, protection of human rights or the promotion of peace or Aboriginal land rights, for example. These do not come within the ambit of the exclusion clause, which refers to the environment and consumer protection. Last year we had a long and detailed discussion or debate in this chamber about these clauses in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My legal advice is that community organisations from the Wilderness Society through to Greenpeace, the maritime unions and social justice groups will be threatened with up to a $750,000 fine if they take part in action which is found by a court to be secondary boycott action when their intent is to promote civil rights, peace and Aboriginal rights, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave the prospective example during the committee hearings last time that, were Aboriginal groups or certainly environmental groups or social justice groups joined with Aboriginal groups to blockade a uranium mine&mdash;for example, the Jabiluka proposal specifically&mdash;they have the threat of this legislation hanging over their head. I would be very pleased indeed if the minister could reassure the committee that that is not the case. It would clear the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I became all the more concerned about this legislation after it was passed because 23 days after its enactment on 1 January a seaman aboard a foreign vessel jumped ship in Newcastle and almost lost his life escaping from the deplorable situation aboard that ship. The maritime unions were unable to take the usual course of putting bans on that ship while things were rectified aboard because the threat of legal action under this section was hanging over their head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipping company involved took legal action. I am not sure whether it was specifically under the new provisions of the Workplace Relations Act but that threat was there. Let us remind ourselves that it is not just a threat of community service. It is a $750,000 fine&mdash;and it is a $750,000 fine because the intent of this legislation is to put unions and community groups out of business, to bank 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8042"> rupt them, effectively, to make them insolvent. That is a very serious matter for the officers of the community groups or unions to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been conjecture within conservation groups as to whether, for example, a blockade on a woodchip ship or a coal carrying or uranium carrying ship might not invoke the penalty of a three&hyphen;quarter of a million dollars fine of a group that was directly involved or that had even given advice about such a blockade. It would help greatly if the minister or Senator Parer were able to stand up in this committee and say, `These concerns are wrong. Under this legislation, community organisations, environment groups, social justice groups and Aboriginal communities will not and cannot be penalised. This $750,000 threat does not apply to them.' That would help clear the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would further help clear the air if the parliamentary secretary was able to say something about the unions with a humanitarian record like the maritime unions, which have effectively brought to dock the ships of shame with deplorable conditions. We have heard about them. This includes torture, rape and depravation of basic human rights, throwing overboard basically imprisonment on ships without pay&mdash;not for months but for years&mdash;of seamen who happen to find themselves under a flag of convenience on the wrong ship with the wrong captain in the hands of the wrong company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has not been allowed in Australia. These ships coming into our waters have had to come good. They have had to improve their standards and repay moneys where seamen have not been paid for years. That is because the union has been able to say, `Until you do the right thing and until you act in a responsible manner, this ship goes no further.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation as I read it says, `Well, a maritime union group that wants to take such action against such deplorable conditions in Australia'&mdash;we are talking about ships in Australian ports&mdash;`runs the risk of a three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollar fine.' I would like to know that that is not so. Unless I can get a categorical assurance from the government that that is not so, I stick by this amendment,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to give Senator Brown some assurances which were given in the debate late last year. They were assurances that I gave on behalf of the government. The government does believe that this amendment is not necessary. We will therefore be opposing it. We do not think a specific exemption in section 45DD of the Trade Practices Act to cover protest action relating to human rights, peace and Aboriginal land rights is required because protest action for these purposes is highly unlikely to amount to boycott conduct within the meaning of sections 45D, DA or DB of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to clarify it for Senator Brown&mdash;I hope this is clarification enough for him to withdraw the amendment&mdash;to be caught by section 45D, boycott conduct must involve a person acting in concert with one or more other persons in a way that, firstly, hinders or prevents a third person from supplying goods or services to a fourth person&mdash;that is, the target&mdash;or, secondly, hinders or prevents a third person from acquiring goods or services from the target fourth person. Further, the action must be taken for the purpose of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of the target and have or likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of the target. Social protest action is highly unlikely to meet these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the other point that should be made is that the Green amendment would go a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8043"> further than just giving a narrow exemption to those sorts of protests. It would, because of its wording&mdash;I suspect, in the dominant purpose part of it&mdash;cover industrial action in the form of boycotts for reasons related to environmental or consumer protection or social protests. The government, I repeat, does not believe that such actions should fall within the section 45DD exemption because there is no doubt that industrial action of this type will inevitably harm employers who are clearly the innocent parties in respect of these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, that confirms my fears. If the wording that I have put forward is simply redundant in terms of protecting environment and consumer groups that might take action, no harm is done. But the parliamentary secretary's assertion that it is highly unlikely to amount to such a thing gives me no assurance at all. It means that there is a risk involved. It is that risk that is held over the heads of community organisations by big corporations time and again in these situations. I once had North, Australia's biggest woodchipper, which marauds Tasmania's forests, warn me that anything said as a Wilderness Society spokesperson that they thought was injudicious went before at least four QCs. It was a very clear threat by that corporation to shut up a community group that was opposing the destruction of forests in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies here. No more was I able to get four QCs to give me the assurance that I could proceed without great caution in what was said than were community groups, including conservation and social justice organisations, or unions for that matter. No more are they going to be able to match the legal firepower of these big corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is meant to stifle community protest. It is meant to stifle community concerns about social justice, the environment, Aboriginal interests and peace, and it will have that effect. As I explained, there are already examples of it having that effect. Let us take the Jabiluka example. If conservation or social justice groups joined the local Aboriginal community in opposing the ship 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of goods in or out of the construction site of the uranium mine as wanted by the uranium mine owners, they would be in the gun. They are facing the draconian penalty: three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars. It is the threat of that which can put people out of action&mdash;and the government knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has already led to a re&hyphen;adjustment of the ability of community groups right around this country to be up&hyphen;front, active and involved in social justice and environmental issues. It is a draconian penalty. It is a threatening, immobilising law. It will be used against community groups further down the line. It is there because it is intended to be used and this amendment by the Greens is meant to knock it out. It is meant to give some protection to community groups to allow them to be able to use their civil rights, their rights in a democratic country to dissent, to protest and to do so without the threat of simply gargantuan fines penalising them and putting them out of action; completely destroying community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not seen that before in legislation in this country, but we are seeing it here. It does have the ability to destroy community groups simply by dint of the size of the fine that is involved. I stand very strongly by this amendment and I hope that our friends in the Democrats will at least exercise the benefit of the doubt in favour of the community groups which are threatened by this legislation. We have had in the past conflicting legal advice, but in that situation I think the benefit of the doubt must go to the community organisations involved. If this amendment to protect these interests is unnecessary or redundant, no harm done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is very little doubt that the ability that has been given in the 1996 Workplace Relations Act to industry is used and is there as a threat. It is certainly the case that social justice groups, consumer groups, environment groups, Aboriginal land groups, people concerned about, for instance, rain forests, the impact on the environment and the impact on those people whose habitat has been removed are going to find it very difficult, if not impossible, to take on multination

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly not the case that in any way we should allow a situation where the best legal advice the government can come up with is they do not think it will apply, because if the law is not clear enough to make this sure, then it will be used again and again to make sure such actions, based on human rights, environment or basic social justice concerns, will be prevented. The sum of $750,000 might not be a lot of money to the coalition, but people who put hours and hours of voluntary service in for the environment and for social justice&mdash;and there are thousands and thousands across Australia who operate these kinds of services on the smell of an oily rag, or the smell of a non&hyphen;oily rag, depending on whether you are an environment group&mdash;will have no means of survival. This is obviously what the government is suggesting. Nobody will take the risk, even if they believe they have an absolutely firm case that nobody can really prove that what they did was technically to harm an industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you really do not want someone to bring in rainforest timber, what you want to do is prevent that import. How do you then be sure, with virtually no resources, that you are going to be able to fight and win that case, because every time, even if you do win a case, there will be an appeal? There is no way. It is a bit like a game of poker, where the person with the least to lose can keep going until the other person has to blink. We all know that that is the case. I have seen the case with slap suits in Western Australia, how the law is used to beat people on the head who in fact have a winnable case but who do not have the ability to take on the risk, to take on a multinational corporation. Therefore, the Greens (WA) will strongly support this amendment which Senator Brown has moved and which is the same as the amendment he moved in the industrial relations bill when we debated it the last time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a look through my papers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on this stuff and I recall the very intense debate that occurred around this issue. Those on the progressive side of politics do feel very strongly about the question of persons not engaged in industrial action but engaged in primary boycotts on consumer, environmental or human rights grounds being appropriately protected. I argued then that the Democrats had successfully found the appropriate protection. Senator Brown quite rightly says that the legal advice he had differs from that we had&mdash;and, as we all know, lawyers do differ. There is always a problem, therefore, arising from excessive reliance on one or the other until it is resolved in fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to questions of fact that I think we should address ourselves. That is, we should ask whether Senator Brown's fears have as yet been realised. I think his question to the parliamentary secretary really drew attention to what is still a query as to whether there will be a negative effect on those protest movements who need to be supported in our society and that the movements will not in any way be threatened or diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a look at the legal advice that was offered by Sydney lawyer Tim Robertson to the conservation council. I will quote again, because they are still relevant, aspects from his opinion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have carefully considered the contending claims of Senators Murray and Brown concerning the effect of the secondary boycotts amendments to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill at that time was the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially Dr Brown is incorrect in contending that a wide variety of legitimate protest action would be caught by the Bill as amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Brown's legal advice was erroneous, because it ignored the broad exemption of all consumer boycotts from these provisions of the Trade Practices Act: s.51(2A), and it failed to examine recent decisions which have broadly defined the term `environment' and consumer action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a later paragraph, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of `environmental protection' which is a permissible purpose for undertaking otherwise prohibited boycott action will be broadly construed by the Courts in accordance with the High Court's decision. It will be construed to include, for example, the living conditions of indigenous groups 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8045"> whose dispossession is as much an impact on the environment as a consequence of the environmental impact of the extractive industry whose presence causes that dispossession. I have used this example because it was relied upon in the legal advice to Dr Brown as an example of a purpose which would not be protected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The two most common forms of protest engaged in by human rights and consumer and environmental groups have been consumer boycotts and picketing. Picketing can be for any number of reasons, including those to do with the environment. Consumer boycotts are expressly excluded from the operation of the Trade Practices Act by section 51(2A), and pickets have been upheld again and again by the courts as a valid and legal form of protest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court in the 1993 J&hyphen;Corp case held that peaceful picketing was not a secondary boycott. It is my belief always that it is a primary boycott. This is because the purpose of the picket was not to hinder and to prevent trade but to affect and hinder the outcome, which would be contrary to that which would normally be undertaken in industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Except for one instance that I can recall, under Labor's laws&mdash;they were harsher in this area than are these laws because we had built in the protections we have through our amendments&mdash;environmental groups have not been challenged or threatened in court action. Unless that has happened and can be proven to have happened since the passage of this law 10 months ago, I think it would confirm the Democrats' and my belief that, in all those areas which Senator Brown quite rightly feels strongly about, in respect of environmental and consumer protection in the broadest way in which it has been defined in the courts&mdash;it includes cultural and peaceful and other motivations&mdash;we are still appropriately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, having considered again at length Senator Brown's proposal, and knowing as you do where we stand on environmental and human rights issues&mdash;you know what our policies and our positions are&mdash;we do not think that the government has put us at any risk. We will continue to support the act as it is written.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very fact that we have conflicting legal advice&mdash;mine comes from Gary Corr, who is an eminent barrister&mdash;fills me with terror.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment clears the air. It states categorically that such groups are protected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why this amendment is not being supported. I cannot understand why, if it simply endorses the protection that is in the legislation, the air is not cleared by this being supported by the Democrats. But that is as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fear is embodied in this legislation as far as potential action is concerned. I repeat that it involves fines of three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars going against social justice, environment, Aboriginal and peace groups in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am here to defend their interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are nine bills involved in this package of legislation. I would like to indicate that the opposition does not oppose the package of measures that have been introduced by the government. There are two elements to the package. The first can be described as the fuel substitution package. The second comprises two pieces of legislation and is also tied to the issue that was debated in the other place, the House of Representatives, in response to a decision handed down by the High Court on the collection of excise as a result of a challenge launched by the state of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to firstly say one or two things about the fuel substitution package, which is a package of seven bills. The measures that are to be set out in this legislation will implement the government's budget decision to combat revenue lost through the minimisation of fuel substitution and to improve compliance in the payment of customs and excise duty. The measures will provide for the addition of chemical markers to concessional petroleum products. They will impose penalties for the use of marked products and sale of marked products for use as internal combustion engine fuels and for the blending of marked and unmarked products. What that means in plain English is that they will dye the fuel so you can work out which is right and which is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these measures, there will be some enhanced record keeping requirements that will be imposed on fuel users. The use of a chemical marker will enable the Australian Customs Service to detect when these products are blended with or substituted for excisable fuel. This package is designed to prevent the substitution of heating oil for diesel fuel. Heating oil attracts a much lower excise duty than diesel fuel. It can be substituted for it but with considerable danger because it has a much lower flashpoint and can result in damaging effects to the vehicle in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the opposition supports this move on both safety and environmental grounds. It will provide a standard of proof to enable prosecution of people found illegally 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> selling or illegally blending fuels for on&hyphen;road use. We believe that giving customs officers these additional powers to monitor abuses in this way is a good advance. It is an attempt to prevent people substituting environmentally degraded products in fuels and therefore causing environmental damage. What it does is say that if people do the wrong thing then by having an appropriate chemical marker in place the government officials will be able to determine this and, as a consequence, a penalty will be imposed. As I have said, we support that move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular bills, the  Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Bill 1997 ,  Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 ,  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 and the  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  all deal with the same issues. They are primarily concerned with addressing a revenue problem for the government. If you understand the complexity of how all of those bills interrelate you are doing far better than most of us. But the opposition does recognise that the introduction of these measures will address loopholes in existing excise legislation. In addition to bringing benefits of increased collection of revenue to the government, they will benefit consumers through ensuring safer petroleum products. They will also provide protection to the petroleum products distribution and retail system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this package being debated in the House of Representatives, the opposition received correspondence from oil recyclers and oil re&hyphen;refiners, voicing their concerns that this package of legislation will result in a more onerous excise regime for them, thus making them less commercially competitive. The opposition obtained advice from Customs that there would be a differential excise regime for oil recyclers and oil re&hyphen;refiners that would address the concerns that they have raised. I would like the minister to confirm 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8048"> that this will be the case and I am sure he will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I will say that the opposition does not oppose the fuel legislation package. However, in preparing this package the government engaged in consultation with parties with an interest, including oil companies, oil distributors, the National Farmers Federation, motoring organisations such as the NRMA, the RACV and the RACWA and consumer affairs bodies. In his second reading speech the minister made a commitment to take into account any ongoing concerns about the operation of these measures. I take this opportunity to remind the government of that commitment. We understand this is to be a message from the government that they will fix any unintended problems that will arise as a result of this package, and I would like to ask the minister to confirm that for the record. With those remarks, I do indicate that the opposition will support this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R257">Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF> , is a bill which could have been handled simply but in fact has been handled very badly by the government. There have been discussions over time and the concerns that have been expressed over time have not been dealt with. They could have been dealt with very simply. In my contribution today I will explain how those issues could have been dealt with. The fuel oil bills presented here are not ones that I, nor I think many people, have any substantial problems with. I do not think anyone objects to ensuring that the use of unprocessed waste oil to thin out ordinary fuel is not promoted. Currently, the system of excise means that such oil can be added to reduce fuel taxes, which does provide incentives for such practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practices referred to often mean that contaminated or inappropriate products are mixed with fuel, with the result that emissions from burning such fuel are even more polluting than normal. Contaminants can result in chemical combinations from burning which are further recombined when struck by sunlight in what are called photochemical reactions. These occur with the burning of most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> petroleum products, but adding additional contaminants and further decreasing the efficiency of burning greatly increases the type and volume of chemicals in the photochemical mix. The resulting products are often toxins to either animal or plant life: carcinogens, mutagens or other kinds of nasty substances. The Greens support any measures that will reduce the chemical load we and the ecology are exposed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, this issue seems to specifically affect waste oil. In 1994, there were about 213 million litres of waste oil produced. Of that, about 120 million litres were collected for recycling or some other use. That is 120 million litres that did not get tipped down waste water drains or get dumped into the earth and eventually into ground water. The figures also mean that some 97 million litres of oil were dumped into the environment. We are talking about an environmental disaster equivalent to an oil tanker accident occurring each year in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, there are efforts to recycle oil. In garages and motor repair shops around the country, and in industries doing a lot of transport, there are often drums in the corner to collect the waste oil. Home mechanics are asked to catch the waste oil when changing oil and take it to their local service station to put in their waste oil drums. It is then collected by private industry, who pay a small fee for the oil. There is no requirement for recycling oil in most places. It is a voluntary activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with most recycling, the major cost is in collecting a highly dispersed product. Coming from an oilfield or a refinery through to distributors to retailers, the chain is then reversed, needing to come from customers and auto mechanics back to retail sites all over the country, where formal collection takes place. It is then re-refined, or filtered and cleaned, and redistributed back to customers again. As a recycled product, it generally cannot attract the same price as the new product. The collection process is one of the more expensive, labour intensive aspects of recycling. It is one of the factors that keep 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8049"> profit margins in recycling industries close to the bone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, there are some very good recycling companies. Wren Oil in Western Australia collects and processes millions of litres of oil, and uses a fairly high level of technology to clean the impurities and contaminants from the oil. Our worry has been to ensure that this bill does not adversely affect the recycled oil industry, particularly those who are acting responsibly and doing a good job cleaning the waste oil. We want to ensure that they are not directly affected by having a punitive excise put on their product, nor affected indirectly by putting the excise on the use to which their major market puts the oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been an ongoing issue with us in respect of both Wren Oil and other oil recyclers. These companies sell oil for blending to Western Power, the public sector power provider. The oil is used in diesel power stations in Broome, Derby, Exmouth and Esperance. By blending 20 per cent processed recycled oil with ordinary industrial diesel oil, IDO, the outcome is that the fuel for these remote, off-grid state power stations is cheaper and the cross-subsidies in power provision are thereby reduced. It also means that there are avenues for marketing recycled oil, which then does not have to be disposed of by government at a cost to taxpayers. It means that the oil can be used instead of dumped into the environment, and it means that the import of diesel oil is reduced, improving our balance of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It angers me that this bills is being brought forward in this way now. I understand that there is a new minister trying to show that he can push the Senate around, and that means in this case pushing around the Greens for having the temerity to bring these matters up, and not wanting to address them. But that does not really excuse this. The bill was listed as non-controversial three weeks ago. At that time, I discussed our concerns with the minister's advisers. They acknowledged them, talked about what a great job Wren Oil and other recycling companies were doing, expressed appreciation of the magnitude of the problem of waste oil and said they recognised that these companies, with millions of litres 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of waste oil in their holding tanks, would be adversely affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advisers said they not only recognised the problems and issues but were committed to trying to act to resolve them. I said, `Fine. If you get the oil recycling issue resolved, we will be happy to support the bill as non-controversial. Until you do, there's no way we can.' I was assured that we would get something, possibly before the Thursday lunchtime. That did not happen, and I asked for it to be taken off the non-controversial list until the issues were resolved. That was three weeks ago. On Friday, we saw that these bills were scheduled for today. We said, `This is still a problem unless the oil recycling issue is resolved. Once it is resolved, we are happy to see them pass quickly as non-controversial or as ordinary legislation, with only a few minutes comment and congratulations from us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, what we got was a letter, which has not been sent, from the minister to Wren Oil saying that the government proposes to put in place a mechanism&mdash;an undefined regulation&mdash;to exempt the four power stations in Western Australia from the legislation. We were also told that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has not approved the letter, the regulation has not been drafted and, as a consequence, the oil recyclers have not accepted it and there is no real assurance that Treasury will support the modifications. We are told that Jeff Ashauer from Customs will fly out next week to finalise the regulations with the recyclers. We are told that the regulations will then go to executive council and be put in place before the legislation comes into effect at the new year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that there are a lot of unknowns and provisional commitments in here. If the Treasurer agrees then a letter can be sent, and if it is sent then a regulation can be negotiated, and if the regulation is drafted then it can go to executive council, and if that regulation actually deals with the issues of the industry and if it is passed by the executive council by 1 January then it resolves the short-term crisis which passage of this bill in its current form will&mdash;not just might&mdash;cause to the oil recycling industry. That is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8050"> terribly reassuring. There are far too many ifs in this chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we have suggested that if the process already put in place continues and Customs come up with a formula of words which meet the concerns of the industry and, in the meantime, agreement is reached for the support of the Treasurer then this bill becomes one which gets support on all sides and will pass through this place easily. With the current timetable that we are assured already exists these things could be in place by next week. In such a case, we have said that we would be happy to see these bills treated as non-controversial. I thought we had some agreement on that. Instead, we see the minister has decided to confront the Senate and waste its time by fighting this out in the chamber instead of taking the commonsense approach. I do not understand why this is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not prepared to support this bill in its current state. I have not seen any evidence that substitution of fuels is a massive problem nor has the Oil Recyclers' Association. They can very easily imagine that it could be a problem&mdash;they are assured that some big oil companies are involved in unscrupulous practices using unprocessed waste heating oil to thin fuel, but at least some of the members have not actually seen such actions. That being the case, I am not happy to support a bill that will potentially substantially damage the capacity to commercially collect and recycle waste oil, and I will argue against its passage. If there was something that was urgent and these practices were going on then it surely would be incumbent on them to make sure that the requests that we made three weeks ago could have been dealt with urgently. So, if the answer is, `This is urgent and we have to deal with it now,' then the response could have been dealt with and could have been made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I know, the decision was made to push ahead with this bill without even waiting to see whether the Treasurer will support the first step in the chain&mdash;the sending of a letter, of which I have been given a draft, to Mr Wren of Wren Oil. I am happy to be disabused about the Treasurer's support for this, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and if we do not get any response from the minister now we will be asking questions in the committee stage. This letter makes limited assurances but even if they are undertaken they will not be enough to assure that there is no damage to current industries&mdash;so the letter itself does not really help that much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I can tell, the state of play today is almost exactly what it was three weeks ago. There is understanding of this issue by Customs and the advisers of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss). There is a proposal for a solution by regulation. There is no draft of what the regulation should be. There is no agreement from Treasury. There is no commitment that adequate regulations will be in place by the time the legislation takes effect. This was the situation three weeks ago and nothing has changed. I cannot see that progress has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You want the Senate to pass this bill in the hope that maybe things will start happening, maybe the Treasurer will approve and maybe the regulations will be in before damage is done. Is that what the minister is asking? This really is not good enough. If it was some industry that was dear to the heart of the government I am sure that you would be listening to the concerns. But maybe it is because is it an oil recycling industry. Maybe the people who have the ear of the government are those people who use oil&mdash;perhaps lots of oil. Maybe those are the people the government is listening to. It is interesting at a time when people are talking about fossil fuels and greenhouse gas that the government might be taking that approach. I would hate to think that that was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any link in that string of maybes breaks down then once this legislation is passed there stops being any reason for Western Power to buy recycled oil from the recyclers and the tanks will overflow. After a few months the oil recyclers may well be in trouble economically&mdash;a few months may be all that is necessary to do it. Other people in the industry might be happy about that. I do not know about the government. If they fold then no-one will collect the waste oil. This is a disaster and I do hope that the minister takes it into consideration and gives me some very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8051"> clear reasons why this is being done in this way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Cook and Senator Margetts for their contributions to the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R257">Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF>  and related legislation. I note that they both basically support the legislation. Senator Cook raised a couple of questions. One was in regard to the differential regime, and I think that he would appreciate, as would other senators, that under the legislation some products previously escaping will be caught by the legislation. That is one of the reasons it was brought in&mdash;the recycled oil was being used in the transport system and not for the purpose it was originally intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the issues raised by Senator Margetts, I say from the outset that this government is very enthusiastic to see that this oil is recycled rather than ending up in places where it should not. But Senator Margetts has raised specifically the issues in regard to power stations in Western Australia and the companies that produce recycled oil in Western Australia, which include not only Wren oil, which she has mentioned, but also Oil Energy Corporation Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 20 October last, the then minister for customs put the view to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that the existing concessional situation should be maintained in view of the following factors: the immediate environmental effect of removing the market for products derived from the recycling of up to 11 million litres of oil a year in Western Australia; the comparatively small amount of revenue involved; the fact that this revenue was not part of the $25 million increase expected from the fuel substitution minimisation legislation, as it was not known at the time that the blended fuel was being used for the remote power station; the advisedly relatively short time frame of the requested concessions, as the Western Power Corporation's submission advises that three of the power stations mentioned are likely to convert to alternative fuel sources within a two- to three-year time frame; in addition, a sunset clause could be imposed; and the fact that it appears possible 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to quarantine a concession to fuel to the four power stations concerned. In addition, for operational reasons, there is a limit on the percentage of recycled material which the power station operators are prepared to utilise.</PARA>

Can the minister confirm that about 20 per cent of residents in some nursing homes have been given incorrect income assessments? Can he also confirm that many other residents have not received an income assessment at all and that this means nursing homes will have to charge

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for the question. No, I am not aware of those points that Senator McKiernan raised. It was interesting that the opposition's spokesman on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS>  program said that nursing homes were in `desperate straits'. If they are in desperate straits and Labor was in power for 13 years, the opposition has something to be accountable for to the Australian public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, with all due respect, it is not entirely the opposition's fault. It is important for everybody to recognise that one in eight of the population in this country is now over the age of 65 and 50 per cent of the bed days in public hospitals are occupied by people over the age of 65. Therefore two&hyphen;thirds of our health care dollar in this country is spent on people over the age of 65. There are enormous problems, but at the same time there is good news. The fastest growing group in this community are people over the age of 80.</PARA>

The fastest growing group in the community are those over the age of 80. I hope one day that Senator Schacht is there, because they are the fastest growing group and people have to take this into account. However, only 30 per cent of people over the age of 85 need residential care. So we are discussing a relatively small population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note today is Breast Cancer Awareness Day and it reflects on the fact that more than half of the population are female. That age group is predominantly female&mdash;there are twice as many females over the age of 85 as males. I come back to Senator McKiernan's question.

Senator Herron was specifically asked if he could confirm that a significant number of residents in nursing homes have been given incorrect income assessments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston. In the last election campaign the coalition was up front with the Australian public in foreshadowing the sale of one-third of Telstra. Is this government's approach to the sale of one-third of Telstra fully consistent with its election promise, and are there any other approaches worthy of being taken into account?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, what the government has done to date is entirely consistent with what we said prior to the last election, and that was that we would put our proposal before the people at the appropriate time, as we did. We argued our case. We were elected on the strength of it and the policy then went on to make it clear that, if we are were ever minded to go further, we would once again put that matter before the Australian public. That, of course, is the honest and honourable way to approach these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have been pretty consistent on this. While they have been consistently wrong, they have at least had the courage of their convictions and they have consistently opposed privatisation. I hold my breath, but I doubt very much that we will be seeing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much of a change from them in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this crowd has prior convictions as long as your arm. If their form were that of a racehorse they would be up before the stewards and they would be swabbed and they would be rubbed out. Prior to the 1990 election they said that they would keep the Commonwealth Bank in full public ownership. Immediately after the election they said they would sell off 49 per cent of it. Before the 1993 election they promised to keep the Commonwealth Bank in majority public ownership. Then Ralph Willis solemnly and sincerely confirmed that in the Commonwealth Bank prospectus. Only two years later they again welched on that commitment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less than 12 months ago Labor was vehemently opposing the government's one-third sale of Telstra, saying that Telstra should stay in full public ownership. Now we have this platform conference proposal that Labor supports Telstra's retention in majority public ownership and will maintain the power of the minister to direct Telstra in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Schacht has made very clear on a previous occasion, that is simply code for saying, `We have a marginal seat strategy and if we think we need to tell Telstra to do something that is otherwise uneconomic but in our political interest we will have no hesitation in doing so.' One can understand where they come from politically, but I can assure you that the business community and potential investors will be horrified to hear that once again Senator Schacht is reaffirming that he has that approach. This is the whiteboard strategy all over again. If you see a milch cow and you think that you do not have the money to solve the problem you direct it to solve it for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this is really about&mdash;and I think Senator Allison identified it&mdash;is that if Labor gets its hands on the honey pot, they will go a lot further than 49 per cent. Senator Schacht says publicly he has no plans to further sell down Telstra shareholding. Why would anyone ever believe that? The Left claims to be violently opposed. I do not know what the disgruntled unionist faction, the Bolkus Left&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8054"> the one that Senator Schacht nominally belongs to&mdash;has to say about this. But once again, it seems extraordinary that they can expect anyone to believe their claim that they have no plans to sell down further. We know where former Senator Kernot stood. She was adamantly opposed, but she has been told to keep quiet, sit on her hands and say nothing on this issue. That is the sort of the policy leadership that we are now getting from the alternative leader of the Labor Party. So nothing much has changed about Labor, despite the fact that Simon Crean now wants to call them `Real Labor'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was not the architect. If the opposition will listen, I will tell them who the architects were. The architects were the many residents of nursing homes and the nursing home proprietors who approached the government because there was a desperate need, as the opposition spokesman herself said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS>  program, for money to be spent on nursing homes. I enumerated on previous occasions the desperate strait they were in as a result of the Labor Party's failure to spend money in the 13 years they had the opportunity to do so. The opposition spokesman even said that the Labor Party spent $1 billion. She forgot to mention that it was over 13 years, so they spent about $70 million a year. The nursing homes of this country have been run down over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in terms of bonds, we have extended the Labor Party's policy on hostels

There are no caps on them. Very few have in fact paid bonds to date, so we cannot give a representative sample to those who are wondering what has been occurring over that period. We are monitoring the situation and I am happy to tell Senator Campbell that we will continue to do that. It will be finetuned as necessary in the light of what comes through.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Campbell may not be aware that there are certain people who want to go into a very high quality nursing home, and they can afford to do so.

But the real point is that there is no doubt that in the short term there is a temperature rise. Although the full consequences are not known, it is sensible for the international community to be responding prudently in relation to that temperature rise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need to increase the awareness of breast cancer so as to reduce the number of women who are affected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Post is contributing to that awareness, and it also understands the consequence of breast cancer in its own workplace, as the chairman, Mrs Nicholls, pointed out in the launch today.

Linda Reaby said to me in her letter that it is not just a medical problem; it is a social concern. That is so true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the things that we know about breast cancer are that risk increases with age; over 70 per cent of breast cancers occur in women over 50; and nine out of 10 women who get breast cancer do not have a strong family history of breast cancer&mdash;it is important for people to realise that. Women who have a relative who has breast cancer face an increased risk of developing the disease. Remember this also: 100,000 women with breast cancer are still alive in Australia today, and we want to increase that number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's stamp launch will help save more women's lives by raising awareness of the need for mammograms for women over 50 and for those over 40 who have had a family history of the disease and ensuring ongoing research funding.

I really urge all Australians&mdash;men and women&mdash;to ensure that they stop to think each time they lick a stamp, post a letter or receive a letter whether they are doing what they need to do to ensure that Australian women do not die of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is making a substantial contribution to medical research through the National Health and Medical Research Council, with $1.9 million allocated for research into issues regarding breast cancer in 1997. It is also providing specific funds for breast

I am just wondering whether the minister thinks it is appropriate or moral that one of the first decisions of the bank at its post&hyphen;privatisation AGM will be to give the CEO a 52 per cent pay increase to $1.32 million when the bank has slashed 10,000 staff&mdash;that is a quarter of its staff&mdash;and closed 400 branches since privatisation began back in 1992. Does the minister think that is appropriate? Minister, do you agree that the winners out of privatisation are always the minority of Australians who can afford to buy shares, or the foreign investors and the managers of former public enterprises, and that the losers are always the rest of the population who do not have the money to buy shares?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen today is a simple question from Senator McKiernan which could not be answered. Again we were told, `We must come back with the detail.' There was a simple question from Senator Faulkner: `What does this government mean by mutual obligation?' Again, no answer. Even when it came to slithering out of this chamber on the question of the miserable backdowns that they have announced today, this minister could not get it right. We have very simple propositions that have been announced in the other chamber, yet this minister is unable to communicate them effectively to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slithering that we are seeing on this issue reflects a government in complete disarray. It is a government incapable of facing up to some of the basic implications of the policy that they have announced. You have a right to expect that ministers be able to answer simple questions. After all, it was this government that took $500 million out of the aged care budget. It was this government that introduced legislation with an effective starting date of 1 October. It is this government whose policy has thrown the aged care and nursing home industry into complete disarray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would expect that the ministers would be able to answer simple questions. Instead, what have we heard? Last week, in response to a question from Senator Denman on prudential funds and the use of payments to those funds, the minister said:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8066"> `We will get back to you,' with other figures requested and, `I will let you know the outcome in due course.' In response to Senator Gibbs, who asked a question with regard to the $100,000 up&hyphen;front entry fee bonds we were told:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we stand again&mdash;aged care ad infinitum. Once again the Australian Labor Party has demonstrated that they are not prepared to hear the good news. What we have today is nothing more than political scaremongering and grandstanding. Some of the very issues that you have raised here today have been addressed by the Minister for Family Services, Warwick Smith. But do you give any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consideration to those? No, you don't. Nursing homes are in a state of disrepair and their funding is on an unsustainable economic footing. Today your shadow minister, Jenny Macklin, said herself that the nursing home sector was in a desperate state. Let us have a look at why that might be the case. The ALP when in government reduced capital funding to nursing homes by 75 per cent between 1992&hyphen;93 and 1995&hyphen;96. It cut funding by 75 per cent; yet you have the audacity to raise this issue again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Government deliberately ran down the nursing home sector. Professor Bob Gregory told you in 1985 that $125 million was needed every year to upgrade nursing homes. The reality is that our nursing home sector is not a dignified place for many old people. We have heard many times about the fire standards that are not being met, about the health standards that are not being met and about the cramped living conditions in nursing homes. However, today the Minister for Family Services, Warwick Smith, has said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly there has been rising concern in the community about elements of the reforms. Much of this concern is totally unfounded and is the product of one of the most outrageous scare campaigns this country has ever seen. There has been an extraordinarily cynical and irresponsible manipulation of older people's fears by the Labor Party, without regard for the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to demonstrate for the Senate some of the excellent changes that have been announced today. These changes will eliminate some anomalies that have become apparent and will protect existing nursing home residents and hostel residents. Under the changes announced by the minister, income testing will be deferred until 1 March 1998 and will only apply to new residents entering care on or after that date. Residents in care before 1 March 1998 will not pay higher income tested fees. For the purposes of income testing for nursing home and hostel benefits, assets gifted prior to 20 August 1996&mdash;an issue that the opposition has been raising&mdash;will not be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing hardship provisions will be extended to protect carers who have been caring for two or more years&mdash;down from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8067"> five years&mdash;and residents who were in hostels prior to 1 October 1997, when the new arrangements commenced, and who were affected by this change to the daily fee will have their fees reduced to the level they were paying before 1 October. Hostel providers will be compensated by a new supplement paid by the government to all residents in care prior to 1 October. You are looking very pleased, Senator Bishop, as well you might.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to accommodation bonds, while they have worked well for hostels&mdash;they were introduced by the ALP, I have to remind everyone&mdash;people will have other choices if they are entering nursing homes. Our package of reforms has always included a number of alternatives to the lodgment of an up&hyphen;front bond, and these are particularly important to nursing home residents. It is just a shame the opposition has failed to highlight any of these and once again has been relying on scare tactics. These options allow people to pay periodically or pay their accommodation contribution from their estate if that is their preference. These options remain, and the government will listen to other suggestions about how this contribution can be made over the coming weeks. Have you heard that? The government will listen to other suggestions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unnecessary and unfair changes to aged care policy that have brought fear and confusion to our elderly over the last several weeks culminated this weekend with the withdrawal of two elderly people from a nursing home because they believed they could no longer afford to pay. These two elderly people left their place of care after receiving notification of the increase in fees and what the new daily charges would be. One can only assume that these two people are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to confusion and fear within the community regarding the recent changes announced by this government. This is a shameful indictment on this government and its representatives here in the Senate. Its handling illustrates either a callous disregard for the elderly or a high level of incompetence by the government&mdash;probably both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes by this government will mean that pensioners requiring nursing home care will be means tested and could see daily fees increase from $21 to around $60. The changes, however, do not stop there. Pensioners will be required to sell their homes to pay up&hyphen;front bonds and entry fees. this is an attack on one of Australia's oldest traditions&mdash;the tradition of home ownership and of security. No longer will Australians be able to pass their family home on to their children. It will now be sold to buy health care; health care that under previous governments was provided on a needs basis, not a cost basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have these changes been championed by the government? It is because they ripped $500 million from aged care in the last budget and will be using it for pork&hyphen;barrelling come election time. This government should forget that election pork&hyphen;barrelling, put the $500 million back into aged care and remove the fear and confusion that they have generated in our elderly community. It is indisputable that there has been a public outcry against these government changes. Yet what has been the government's response? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in Hobart several weeks ago that these changes were `fair, defensible and equitable.' Fair they most certainly are not. There is nothing fair about two elderly Australians leaving their nursing home because information from the government allowed them to believe that they could no longer afford proper care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy has been anything but defensible, with the government and in particular the minister and his representatives in this chamber lurching from one embarrassing gaffe to another&mdash;one poor and confusing explanation of the changes to another. Is it any wonder that electorate offices like mine have been inundated with calls from elderly people asking for some explanation of what the changes mean and what type of care they will be able to afford in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Equitable' is also a word that I would not have used to describe these changes. What is equitable about care provided on ability to pay as opposed to need? Equitable is not a term that creates a two&hyphen;tiered system. Under one system those with little income and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8068"> moderate house value will be placed in a nursing home with fewer resources and capital expenditure. Under a second system those fortunate enough to have the money will have access to top levels of care. I do not deny these people this high level of care; I simply believe that it  should be accessible to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister did not stop with comments regarding the fairness and defensibility of these charges. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> went on to quote the Prime Minister as saying in his party room:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the policy would be a test of his political resolve, declaring in the joint party room the government could not afford to backdown because it would appear to be weak.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I anticipate that there will be an embarrassing backdown by the Prime Minister. That is his nature&mdash;he boldly strikes out with budget cuts, regresses policy changes and leaves his ministers to explain the policy and cop the flak and then he sacks them and amends the policy to save face. In the area of aged care he has done it again with the new minister. He has done it in other areas with Ms Moylan and Amanda Vanstone and he is doing it now with this minister.</PARA>

The Prime Minister and his government, egged on by a backbench that had no anticipation of the public outcry, have argued that there is no easy solution to this issue of aged care provision in an increasingly older society. The Labor Party believes that putting back the $500 million they ripped off would be a solid beginning. The government will reject this while it contemplates a range of options that may be pursued to placate the public&mdash;a range of minor options and a range of cosmetic changes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this issue again, as I did on Thursday. On Thursday I said that I wanted to try to put a bit of balance into this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular debate and to look at the real facts in nursing care and where the government was coming from. It is very important that we do that if we are going to be fair and square about this and do justice to aged people. We certainly have not heard that yet from those on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point that I make following on from what I said on Thursday&mdash;and has been said by others&mdash;is that the financially disadvantaged will not be affected. There are a number of beds being kept for those people&mdash;in hostels it is 23 per cent and in nursing homes it is a minimum of 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I made was that people entering nursing homes do not have to sell their homes. But you need to look at where the government had to come from. On Thursday I mentioned the $10 billion deficit and the actions that had to be taken by a responsible coalition government. Let us look specifically at nursing care homes and the situation that existed. In nursing homes some 40 per cent of residents share their bedroom with four or more people; 13 per cent of homes do not meet fire regulations; and 11 per cent of homes do not meet health regulations. That has all come from the mess that we were left by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth nothing that during that time Labor cut funding on capital expenditure&mdash;hence some of the problems that I have just outlined. In 1992&hyphen;93 it was $45 million. In 1995&hyphen;96 this had dropped to $10.7 million&mdash;a 75 per cent reduction from that $45 million. And this occurred while the current leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley, was finance minister. So those on the other side cannot just wipe their hands clean and suddenly pretend that this problem has  arrived here today. It has not. It has been inherited and it has got to be fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I make before I get to some of the responses from our Minister for Family Services, Mr Warwick Smith, is that the government will deliver over $1.5 billion for upgrade to nursing homes and associated activities over the next 10 years. The important fact that comes into this is that we have seen from the minister, as I have said, and as has been highlighted by a previous speaker 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8069"> Senator Synon, there are some very significant changes being made to address some of the issues that have come out of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally important, the minister has announced in his statement that he will continue to consult and listen to the users and the wider community. There are a number of matters that I, myself, for example&mdash;and I am sure others&mdash;will want to raise with the minister nonetheless&mdash;accreditation just to give one example. Another issue that I will be raising with him will be the three&hyphen;year term for accreditation. It was pointed out to me over the weekend, for example, that this was an issue that was going to cause a number of concerns to a number of nursing homes. I have no doubt that the minister will deal with these issues as they are brought forward as we attempt to address the deterioration that has occurred in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on a number of matters which are very important. On the introduction of income test subsidies the minister's statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income testing will be deferred until 1 March 1998 and it will apply only to new residents entering care on or after that date. Residents in care before 1 March 1998 will not pay higher income tested fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purpose of income testing for nursing home and hostel benefits, assets gifted prior to 20 August 1996, shall not be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who introduced that particular policy with regard to hostels? It was the previous government under the then Prime Minister Mr Keating. It is your policy, no&hyphen;one else's. You need to remember these things when you get up and carry on and scare the elderly in our community. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residents who were in hostels prior to 1 October 1997, when the new arrangements commenced, and who were affected by this change, will have their fees reduced to the level they were paying before 1 October. Hostel providers will be compensated . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it will not effect them. But it will give those people, prior to 1 October, relief from that particular provision. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will maintain the pre-existing rules for existing residents . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must emphasise this: the pre-existing rules will be maintained for existing residents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the remaining few seconds I have, I re-emphasise that the minister's statement highlights the fact that, as other issues come forward in connection with this particular matter, we will deal with them on their merits.

In fact, I reckon that one will go down pretty well at some of the pensioner meetings around town; I think they will find that particularly difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The smart government backbenchers have already climbed onto the ropes, while the ship is tied up at the wharf, and are sliding down them at a rate of knots. There are a couple from South Australia in the other place who represent fairly aged communities&mdash;one, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus); and the other, who I imagine will be joining her shortly, the member for Makin (Mrs Draper), who is not quite as smart as the member for Hindmarsh. But at the end of the day, with their electorates having large numbers of aged people, they know damn well they are being hurt by this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested today to hear the way in which the Senate was told of significant changes. It was done by the minister, in response to an opposition question, with an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8070"> absolute contempt for the whole set&hyphen;up, which is the way in which he has handled this debate over the last couple of weeks. While the minister told of these significant changes, I listened with a great deal of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, what the government have done with these particular proposals is three things. The first thing they did was to bring in the uncapped bond. We have not heard much about that this afternoon, and I will come back to it in a moment. Another thing they did in the last couple of budgets as to take $500 million out of this area. The third thing they are proposing to do, now that they have delayed it for an extra five or six months, is to whack up the charges associated with nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with those three things in reverse order, what they told us here this afternoon was that they are going to put the fees off until next year, and it will not apply as universally as it did before&mdash;and for this, I guess they are to be congratulated; at least to that extent they have listened. Then they tell us that a few of the other provisions in there, some of the things which really do have a lot of aged persons very concerned, will also be delayed until next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I was waiting for the Moran clause. I was waiting to hear something about the bond that is being charged for this. When I put the telly on yesterday morning and I saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Program</EMPHASIS>, I saw one of the pieces of humanity there who really did not do very much for me. I wanted to record that segment of film and send it out to every member of the Labor Party in South Australia and say, `This is why you are paying your fees: to protect the community from the likes of this person.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never heard anything today, not a word, announcing that the old bond is going to be changed, or delayed, or any of the rest of it. You see, they cannot do that because that is at the very heart of this matter. This is the payola to people who have paid them through the bad years, the 13 years. I have no doubt that the bloke who was on TV yesterday probably was one of the main architects of this particular system. If he was not, then I have to say this: he is doing pretty well out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of what someone else thought up; he is doing extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told here last week by the minister that this particular man should be commended. He is a self-made man. He has made lots of money in his life. Well, he is making it over the bones of a lot of frail and elderly people. That is the sort of stuff we on this side will not be tolerating. Yes, there is a problem in the nursing homes. It will grow as the age of the population grows. But it has not been made any better by all of these supposed changes for the better. It will not be made any better if they persist with these changes. And I will make one further prediction: I bet before long there will be a few more changes around town too because, at the end of the day, when you come across a piece of dog dirt on the pavement, like this policy is, then you know it for what it is. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.28 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said the other day and, I am sure, will be said again: the real issue in this matter needing to be addressed is the state of nursing homes and the need to provide good care for the elderly people of Australia. The fact of the matter is that the greying of Australia is a reality. The number of people who are over 65 will grow by 48 per cent over the next 20 years&mdash;or so it has been estimated&mdash;and there is a real need to provide good nursing home care for these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said today, but I just repeat for emphasis: the nursing homes of Australia, on average, are of very poor quality. Forty per cent of nursing home residents share their bedroom with four or more people. Thirteen per cent of homes do not meet fire regulations; and 11 per cent of homes do not meet health regulations. There is a need&mdash;and there is no doubt or dispute about it&mdash;to improve the standards of nursing homes, and the government has set out to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with this issue the ALP has engaged in an outrageous campaign of scare tactics which has put fear into the hearts of the very elderly people of Australia at a very vulnerable time in their lives when they face 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8071"> final illnesses, are unable to look after themselves and need to go into nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pick up a couple of points that Senator Bishop and Senator Quirke have made. Senator Quirke talked about the government reducing funding to nursing homes. I point out that the Labor Party cut funding on capital expenditure for nursing homes by a figure representing 75 per cent. In the 1992-93 budget, $45 million was available to nursing homes for capital purposes. In the 1995-96 budget this had dropped to $10.7 million. That is a cut of 75 per cent. So, if anybody is cutting funding to nursing homes, the Senate should be quite clear who is doing it. It is not this government; it was the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government&mdash;the Howard government&mdash;with its reforms will deliver over $1.5 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade nursing homes and that will mean improved comfort, safety, privacy and dignity to older Australians. If anybody can take credit for having sought to improve the standards of nursing homes, it is the Howard government. If anybody deserves criticism for consolidating the pitiful standard of nursing homes by cutting the funding available for capital works, it was the previous government. That just underlines the hypocrisy of the whole case that they have been making about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important thing to be understood is that less than 10 per cent of people in residential care are non&hyphen;pensioners. So the whole question of accommodation bonds only applies to that 10 per cent. Even given that 10 per cent may have to pay accommodation bonds, there are other alternatives available to these people. They can make instalment payments each month or fortnightly, they can pay a combination of up-front fees and instalments or they can defer payment to be taken out of their estate following death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole question of bonds only applies to 10 per cent and the other 90 per cent of people are pensioners. In fact, the government subsidises pensioners to a very large extent in nursing homes. For example, the government pays a subsidy of $31,000 per annum for nursing home care for a full pensioner, it pays $29,700 per annum for a part&hyphen;pensioner and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even in the case of non&hyphen;pensioners&mdash;these people who are being asked to pay accommodation bonds&mdash;the government pays a subsidy of some $24,700 towards their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is very different from the way it has been presented by the opposition. The truth of the matter is that the government is addressing the problem of providing better standards of care for our aged in nursing homes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is obliged under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on the Environment to implement NEPMs. Such implementation is dependent on having the legislation in place. National environment protection measures are being developed for ambient air standards and for the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI). It is envisaged that the NPI NEPM will be finalised by the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) by February 1998. If agreed, the NEPM is intended to have immediate effect and this Bill is intended to implement that on the Commonwealth's part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Bill has not been passed and administrative arrangements for implementation have not been finalised by the time a NEPM comes into force, the States and Territories may perceive this as indicative of a lack of commitment by the Commonwealth to the NEPC/NEPM model of development of national environmental standards. Some States have indicated that agreement to finalise the NPI will not be given if the Commonwealth has not finalised its NEPM implementation mechanism. The Government attaches a high priority to the development of national environment protection measures and to the cooperative arrangements with the States and Territories.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that my notice of motion No. 752, relating to the awarding of a consultancy contract to ACIL Economics, will again be listed for discovery of formal business the next day of sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your statement today you made a claim of public interest immunity for some of the documents referred to in my notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that the claim can be considered before the notice comes up again, I would appreciate your clarification of the following aspects of your statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before proceeding to those aspects, I indicate that I wish the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business to approach parties to the tendering process to seek their agreement to the release of documents involving a comparative assessment of bidders, as your statement indicated that he would, so that those documents can be presented on the next day of sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the report referred to in paragraph (b) in the notice, what is the basis of the claim that the report is commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence? As you would be aware, such a claim must be based on a belief that disclosure of the document would cause damage to the commercial interests of the Commonwealth or others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the nature of the damage to be apprehended? The fact that a document is a Cabinet document, of course, does not prevent the government disclosing the document if it so chooses. What is the nature of the damage to relations with the states to be apprehended from disclosure of the document? Why cannot the agreement of the states to the disclosure of the report be sought? What is the nature of the danger to the physical safety to a person or persons to be apprehended from disclosure of the report?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Brien</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 23 October 1997 concerning your notice of motion No 752 and the tabling of documents relating to two consultancies awarded to ACIL Economics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to your first request, I can advise you that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has instructed his Department to seek, as a matter of priority, the agreement of the tenderers for the May 1996 consultancy to the tabling of the relevant documents. However, I should point out that while early consideration is being sought, given the privacy and confidentiality considerations, the material cannot be released until the parties agree. I am therefore unable to guarantee that any documents will be available for the Senate's next day of sitting. However, as soon as I am in a position to do so, I will inform you of the parties' responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other matters raised in your letter would require me to divulge information contained within the ACIL report. As I have previously stated, that report is part of the deliberative process being undertaken by the Government in formulating its policies to achieve reform on the Australian waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to relations with the States, again the discussions which took place were premised on strict confidentiality being observed. It would be damaging to prospects for reform if the States are not able to be confident in the confidential nature of their involvement in the reform process with the Commonwealth.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also consider that the commercial interests of parties could be jeopardised if the contents of the report were to be released. Individuals and organisations who have a legitimate interest in the achievement of reform on the waterfront provided sensitive information to the consultant on the understanding that it would remain confidential. Their commercial interests could be adversely affected if they were identified. Future dealings between the Commonwealth and these parties would also be jeopardised if they did not have confidence that both the information they supplied and their identity would remain confidential. In some cases, individuals have expressed concern for their physical well being should they be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the reasons set out above, public interest immunity will continue to be claimed in relation to the information you have sought under parts (a), (b), (d) and (e) of motion No 752.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be forwarding a copy of this letter to Senator Harradine.</PARA>

While Austrade is keen to take advantage of all available trade promotion opportunities in the region, under current circumstances it would be difficult to warrant the diversion of resources currently used in South Africa to enable Australian participation in other trade displays (such as the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair). Regional economic growth patterns will require a regular review of the prospects for trade in various sectors and countries and a consideration of the most suitable manner to promote Australian companies. In this regard, it is noted that the Zimbex Trade Fair in Harare is competing with the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair to become the premier trade display in Zimbabwe. In July 1997, the Minister for Trade, Mr Tim Fischer, led a very successful Australian agricultural business delegation to Zimbabwe. This sort of targetted approach to specific sectoral opportunities will pay more dividends than a broad&hyphen;brush approach to trade fairs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Ian McLachlan, made a joint announcement on 15 April 1996 that Australia supports a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines. In the same statement, it was announced that the operational use of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force was indefinitely suspended. This suspension would be reviewed in the case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances in which Australia's security was under threat and denial of an anti&hyphen;personnel landmine capability to the Australian Defence Force would result in additional Australian casualties and damage to vital infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia called for a global ban on landmines at the third and final session of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference held in Geneva in April/May 1996. The Government was disappointed that the Conference failed to support Australia's position but remains committed to pursuing such an outcome. The Conference did achieve the adoption of an amended Protocol II to the Inhumane Weapons Convention which contains 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8090"> stronger restrictions and prohibitions on the use and transfer of landmines and provides better protection for civilians and peacekeeping forces than the existing Protocol (to which Australia is already a party). Following scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and subsequent Executive Council approval, Australia's instrument of consent to be bound by amended Protocol II was deposited with the United Nations Secretary&hyphen;General on 22 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In international fora, the Australian Government will continue to support the growing international movement in favour of eliminating anti&hyphen;personnel landmines as a weapon of war. Australia took part in the international conference of pro&hyphen;ban states and non&hyphen;government groups in Ottawa in October 1996 which looked at future strategies for achieving a ban. Australia also co&hyphen;sponsored the historic resolution adopted at the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly in which, for the first time, the Assembly called for the vigorous pursuit of negotiations for a global ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines. The resolution, adopted on 14 November 1996, attracted 115 co&hyphen;sponsors and was supported by an overwhelming majority of states. The breadth of support shown by the vote is testimony to the strength of international feeling against landmines and reinforces efforts to rid the world of these insidious weapons which kill or maim some 30,000 people a year. In Mr Downer's address to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva on 30 January 1997, he called on that body to deliver a treaty banning anti&hyphen;personnel landmines in a timeframe commensurate with the scale and urgency of the problem. In 1997, Australia campaigned vigorously in the Conference on Disarmament for the commencement of negotiations on a ban and held the position of CD Special Coordinator on this issue from June until the end of the CD's 1997 session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Australia has participated fully in the international meetings and negotiations held in 1997 under the auspices of the "Ottawa Process"&mdash;a Canadian&hyphen;sponsored initiative which has, in an ad hoc forum of countries currently committed to a ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, finalised a ban treaty for signature in Ottawa in December 1997. The question of Australia's signing the Ottawa Treaty is being considered by Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia remains committed to working in all relevant international fora towards the goal of an effective ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines that is global in scope, binding and verifiable. Australia is also committed to the important concomitant task of enhanced international contributions to de&hyphen;mining and mine victim assistance programs. Since May 1996, Australia has committed over $19 million to such programs in Cambodia, Laos, Afghanistan, Mozambique and Angola.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 98 Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Conference held in Cairo and bilateral visit to Kuwait from 5 to 21 September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 98 Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Conference debated and discussed a range of topics including the preservation of democratic processes, employment in a globalising world and the sexual exploitation of children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On all accounts, this was a very successful conference from the point of view of the Australian delegation. Not only was Australia successful with its item on the sexual exploitation of children, but we managed to provide a delegate onto every drafting committee. Two of these drafting committees were chaired by myself and the member for New England, the RT. Hon Ian Sinclair. It is our intention that all Australian delegations participate as fully as possible in each conference and it is to the credit of the Australian delegation that we are regarded as a key contributor to work of the IPU. This should be seen in the context that we are but one of 130 countries that regularly attend each conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was also called on to participate, and subsequently chair, the special committee on the question of affiliation of Palestine into the Union. The committee had the most difficult, unenviable and sensitive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8093"> task of formulating a resolution which was to be considered by the IPU Council. Unfortunately, this resolution was not considered by the Council because a group within the IPU sought to have this difficult matter, again deferred, until the next conference. I have commented on this matter in more detail in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our last report to the parliament, we made a number of recommendations concerning the operation and finances of the IPU. These recommendations were conveyed to the IPU secretariat in Geneva with a request that they be responded to at the Cairo conference. To his credit, the Secretary&hyphen;General did respond and in so doing has agreed to introduce program budgeting so as to more closely monitor IPU finances. With regard to our concern about the establishment of a New York office, the Secretary&hyphen;General said that excellent terms had been concluded in relation to leasing a property near the UN headquarters. The outgoings were not expected to impact on current IPU finances. He also believed that the New York office would provide a suitable vehicle whereby all resolutions passed by the IPU could be  reported to the wider UN forum; this was another concern raised by the Australian group in its last report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation also took the opportunity while in Egypt to visit the Commonwealth War Cemetery at Al Alamein and to visit the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. The MFO plays a very important role in maintaining the peace between Egypt and Israel and its success in due in part to the very professional and widely acknowledged role played by Australian contingent within the MFO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to make a few observations about the bilateral visit to Kuwait. The program that was put in place allowed us an opportunity to meet with the wide range of people at all levels and gave us an opportunity to see at first hand the rapid progress that has been achieved in rebuilding Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion in 1990. The delegation was accorded the highest level of representation and was granted a meeting with the Amir of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the remaining time, I would like to make a number of brief comments in relation to the visit to Kuwait:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this was the first official bilateral parliamentary visit to Kuwait</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the bilateral relationship has grown significantly since 1991 and the prospects for further expansion of this relationship are promising</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a visit to Kuwait demonstrates just how vulnerable a small country like Kuwait is. UNIKOM will need to play a peace&hyphen;keeping role for many years to come. The Kuwaitis are aware of this and are introducing a number of policies that will further develop their links to the world economy. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Many opportunities are available for Australian businesses to take the initiatives and establish ties with Kuwaiti companies</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">political parties are forbidden in Kuwait, but their National Assembly is one of the most progressive and outspoken in the region.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">notwithstanding the massive debts following the Gulf war, Kuwait has managed to pay off its $(US) 5.5 billion loan which was required to finance the war and help with reconstruction</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the chair of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, I am very pleased to table the report of the committee into marine and coastal pollution. This is an issue that touches all Australians. Our love of the sea is well known. Indeed, most of us like to either live somewhere near the coast or holiday there. This has placed enormous strain on our marine environment. Eighty-six per cent of the population live in the coastal zone and 26 per cent live within three kilometres of the coast. Wherever we live, we do use the river catchments. What we do in the river catchments has a major impact on the marine environment. What we wash down the sink or hose into the gutters has a major impact on the oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee inquiry focused on land based sources of marine pollution. That accounts for about 80 per cent of pollution entering the marine environment. In 1994 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force and with it Australia's 200&hyphen;mile exclusive economic zone, which covers more than 11 million square kilometres. It is one of the largest in the world. The convention provides the rights to make use of our coastal zone but it also obliges Australia to protect and preserve the marine environment. Article 207 of the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from land based sources, including rivers, estuaries, pipelines and outfall structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite the legal obligations placed on Australia by its subscription to the UN convention, there is no Commonwealth legislation dealing specifically with land based sources of marine pollution. In the states, pollution of the marine environment tends to be addressed piecemeal or not really addressed at all. It is often addressed by general environment legislation but often management of specific issues is devolved down to local government authorities. In many cases, unfortunately, they do not have the resources&mdash;and in some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cases, not the expertise&mdash;to really address the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By failing to take a national approach, we are avoiding our international responsibilities. For this reason and because of the magnitude and the urgency of the problems facing the marine environment, the committee has made three key recommendations: first, that the government considers the formation of a central authority to coordinate coastal and marine affairs. This body would consult with all spheres of government to coordinate coherent policies across all jurisdictions. Secondly, the committee has recommended that marine affairs be made a standing item on the agenda of COAG. Thirdly, the committee has recommended that the National Environment Protection Council legislation be amended to give the council wider powers to make national environment protection measures so that uniform legislation can be negotiated and passed in all jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The threats facing the marine environment are serious and come from a variety of sources. The most severe of these problems are associated with urbanised or urbanising coastlines. While the Australian population grew by 32 per cent between 1971 and 1991, the population of the non-metropolitan coastal zone grew by 95 per cent in that period. The value of new building in the coastal zone between 1983 and 1991 was around $70 billion. Development on that scale in a whole magnitude of areas governed by different authorities with different policies and different standards has a huge negative impact on the coastal and marine environment. If we do care about the environment and the need for central coordination and legislation to monitor and control this development and other activities, it is very obvious that we have to get together and make sure that that is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence presented to the committee suggested that the elevated level of nutrients and sediments entering the marine environment is one of the most serious issues facing our marine environment. The major sources of these pollutants are agricultural activity, sewage outfalls and urban stormwater. Of grave concern is the threat that these pose all  around our coastline, particularly to the corals 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8095"> of the Great Barrier Reef and the ecology of important seagrass beds. Seagrasses are critical to the long-term sustainability of the coastal zone because they are the nurseries and habitats for a wide range of species, not only endangered species but commercial species as well. This is an important point. Marine based industries are currently worth $30 billion a year. It is estimated that this could rise to between $50 billion and $85 billion within 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee welcomes the development of an oceans policy and the release in January of the marine industry development strategy. But it believes that the desire to exploit the marine environment for economic gain must not hinder strategies to protect the marine habitats and biodiversity. Any such compromise will be counterproductive as it would jeopardise the long-term economic benefits that we could derive from the sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important issue raised during the inquiry was the problem of acid sulphate soils. This is topical in northern New South Wales in particular. This problem has the potential to do enormous damage both to the land and the ecology of rivers and coastal waters. There are around 30,000 square kilometres of acid sulphate soils around our coast, particularly in eastern Australia and northern Australia. Clearing for agriculture releases between 100 and 300 kilograms of pure sulphuric acid per hectare per year, with a devastating effect on fish and other animals in the affected waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even mild doses of acid in waters can leave fish stock prone to disease and unsuitable for sale or eating. Once again, it is the nurseries and the long-term commercial dependence on them that are at risk. Acid waters also corrode infrastructures such as bridges and pipes. The committee believes that this problem must be addressed on the same scale as the salinity problems in the Murray-Darling Basin and must be addressed by the national government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key issue is the problem of exotic species introduced through ships' ballast waters. The committee heard graphic evidence of the effect of the northern Pacific seastar on the ecology of the Derwent River in Hobart. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is spreading up the east coast of Tasmania and threatening marine life, aquaculture farms and scallop and abalone fisheries. Such introduced species are virtually impossible to eliminate once they are actually introduced, so prevention is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 150 million tonnes of ballast water are discharged into Australia's 64 international ports each year by 10,000 vessels from over 300 overseas ports. In addition, some 34 million tonnes of ballast water is moved between Australian ports by domestic shipping. The scope for disaster is enormous. Australia has taken an international lead on this issue but research and surveillance programs must be supported and extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference to the need for research leads me to one of the most significant issues raised before the committee during the inquiry; that is, the lack of adequate scientific understanding and the lack of support for research. Marine science funding tends to favour short&hyphen;term research projects, often just with a commercial objective, but it is taxonomy, the long&hyphen;term identification and classification of organisms, which is fundamental to proper management and planning for the marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proportion to our population we are among the top 10 nations in marine research and output but we have a small population and a very long coastline. The quality of the work done has to be matched by an increase in the number of trained scientists working in marine research. Indeed, we found that there are fewer taxonomists now employed than there were 20 years ago. The committee strongly believe that the federal government must commit more funds to marine science and we hope that the forthcoming marine, science and technology plan will recognise that need and commit the appropriate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of adequate scientific understanding of the marine environment is matched by a widespread lack of understanding in the general community of marine pollution and how it is caused. Education is vital. There are many deeply concerned individuals and community groups that are aware and the committee was impressed with their level of  commitment, but the issue must be something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8096"> that the community as a whole embraces far more than they have done so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highly successful do&hyphen;the&hyphen;right&hyphen;thing campaign might be used as a model. Most of us are not aware that polystyrene food containers dropped, say, in the Adelaide Hills or maybe 10 or 15 kilometres away from the coast and washed into the gutter can eventually go through the stormwater system, be smashed into fragments and end up as fragments out on our coast to be eaten by seabirds. That then will affect their ability to eat other food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education about marine issues is improving in schools with more courses being developed and more schools introducing them. The committee welcomes this and has made recommendations on the matter. Local government is often in the front line of coast and marine protection and it should be encouraged to develop management strategies to protect the environment. But there is a clear need for leadership and assistance from the Commonwealth and state governments as councils are being presented with an increasing responsibility for the environment without adequate funding, resources or coordination. The committee has made recommendations calling for all spheres of government to work together to effectively put in place local policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular I must stress that while a few local government bodies are involved in the community, there is far greater need for local and community concerns to be heard and in particular for all planning applications to be given wide community exposure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter just briefly and later on I will pursue the issue at greater length. I think it is a significant report that has been tabled by Senator Lees today. Just picking up some of the themes that Senator Lees has already outlined, the thing that struck me was the fact that there is a real lack of a database by which we can measure the changes that are occurring in the marine environment out there. This gets to the very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue that Senator Lees referred to: the lack of research that is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there is very good research, and we saw that on our inspections, there is no doubt that there is a real lack of good, solid, ongoing research which firmly enables us to compare the events of the day against a previous database that had been established. So we do not really understand how the marine environment is necessarily changing until some disaster besets us and that is a completely unsatisfactory way to deal with the issue. It is totally reactionary rather than being forward viewing of the issue and establishing the data lines there in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that came to my mind in the inquiry that we held was the lack of coordination. Whilst there was goodwill on the part of many of the people involved in ensuring that our environment is in as pristine a condition as possible out there, nonetheless there is a distinct lack of coordination between the various groups, whether they be government or community groups&mdash;whatever they might be. There is also a need for monitoring and there seems to be a lack of it. So long as that is happening then we are having a degradation in our environment and we are not knowing the damage that is being caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report, I think, addresses these issues well. It looks at the direct effect on the economy of the degradation of our marine environment. Whether it be the waterways, the seas, the oceans, the estuaries, the rivers or the catchment areas, there is no doubt that we need a healthy water system, whichever group we look at, to ensure that we have a good environment, not only to live in but also to survive economically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting issue that was touched on by Senator Lees today was the issue of education. I believe that without education our message is falling on deaf ears. I commend the report to people. I will speak further on this at another stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly on this report. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the hearings on this matter but it is an  area which is of great interest to me from the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8097"> point of view of my electorate, including a very large coastline in Western Australia. Also, I have a personal interest because I work with a number of groups which are working very hard within the community. There is an amazing collection of friends groups along the coast of Western Australia&mdash;and probably growing in other parts of the country&mdash;which have basically taken on a part of the coastline to conserve and which are doing lots of very good hands&hyphen;on work and hands&hyphen;on research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the friends of Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, as an example, in Western Australia are actually doing studies on heavy metals in relation to mussels in the area around the Shoalwater Islands area. They are monitoring the impacts of sewage outfall. They are trying to look at seagrass. They are doing all sorts of work and research on the little penguins in the area, including the potential impact of the levels of pollution on the little penguins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means doing things like going out in a mild swell, perhaps in the middle of the afternoon, and sitting out on a rock in the cold for a couple of hours working out how many penguins come ashore at particular times to try to get the information for baseline studies. It also means doing other studies with tracking devices and so on of the various species along the coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned by Senator Lees and Senator Hogg, a lot of this work has not been done. There does not seem to be a huge political will at the moment for governments to cover that baseline data. For a number of reasons, including marine pollution, and in particular the issue of global warming, we really must get all of that information together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is necessary for the government to provide at some stage some funding for all of those groups throughout Australia who are working on particular species. It should provide a sort of community chest and a collection and distribution system for those people who have baseline information on particular species.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often find that government funding largely goes into commercial areas&mdash;commercial fishing. The interesting thing here is that, even in those areas where there is specific information, the information might well be to do with where the commercial species breed and where commercial species are fished but there is not a lot known about anything in between&mdash;where their juveniles grow up and so on. When there is a major pollution incident, confident statements are made by departments about the impact it will have, but in reality those confident statements cannot be backed up by information about what species might be affected&mdash;whether the species that tend to be near the surface, pelagic fish, when they are in their juvenile stage will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously governments feel that the private sector can do a lot of this better than the current government can. They also seem to think that private funding for research is better than any other funding. But, funnily enough, all of these particular collections of information which are necessary for us to get the picture are not going to happen simply by being privately funded. As I have said, private funding will go towards specific commercial interests. So we will get a jigsaw puzzle with most of the pieces missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end we have to look at the systems&mdash;how they operate and how one thing affects the other. If we really want to know the impact of pollution, we cannot just look at the stage or look at carrying capacity. That is, we cannot just push the situation to the point where the seagrass dies, push the situation with pollution or nutrients to where species simply cease to exist, or push the situation to where the green algae builds up and overruns all other species in a particular area. We simply cannot act in that way. We must take the precautionary principle. In order to take the precautionary principle, we have to know more about what exists in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One very good example is the recent proposals for the Oakajee Port facility in Western Australia. The residents in Geraldton have reliably informed me that the environmental approvals were done without anybody actually going down and seeing the marine environ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8098"> ment and finding out what was there. So ticks were given for the environment, but nobody actually knows what level of seagrass is there. We have maps that say, `No seagrass here,' but there is no indication that any studies were done. So how are we going to know what the impact of pollution might be from the development of a deep water harbour if the studies were never done in the first place? Therefore, if a nice little map says, `No seagrass here,' we should be able to believe that there are no dugongs and that no other impact will occur as a result of the effects from the pollution of that harbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many issues are involved with Australia's marine and coastal networks. It is a precious resource. It is a world resource. There is nothing we can do in this part of the area which is not already linked with the marine environment of other parts of the world, and especially other parts of the region. We have to take this seriously. We have to look after our corrals, our seabeds and our seagrasses. In the end, it is in our best interest to do so. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 18th ASEAN Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Organisation Conference, involving bilateral visits to Laos and Thailand, which took place between 31 August and 19 September 1997. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The delegation involved four members from the House of Representatives and me, from the Senate. The major issues in Indonesia at the AIPO conference were the ongoing development of the region and the admittance of new member states into the ASEAN organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two countries that had applied for membership were Laos and Vietnam, neither of which are noted as democracies in this part of the world. Significant disagreement and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern were expressed by delegates from both the Philippines and Thailand in the formal proceedings of the conference, taking the point that neither country had a fine democratic record&mdash;or none at all&mdash;and should not be admitted into ASEAN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once that debate started, the delegates took the point that the ASEAN Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Organisation was an organisation of parliaments. Particularly in the case of Laos, a parliament does not exist; hence it could not be admitted into the ASEAN Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Organisation. After much debate to and fro, that issue was adjourned into private discussion. As is the common proceedings in forums in that part of the world, a consensus emerged and there was a redraft of the delegation. It was significant to note in this context that significant opposition was expressed by both the Philippines and Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of delegates from all of the ASEAN countries took the opportunity to participate in the dialogue session that was conducted with Australia. The major issue up front for discussion was the issue of racism and how Australia was handling the Pauline Hanson factor in its relationship with countries in that part of the world. The government members and, indeed, the opposition members of the delegation took the opportunity to explain the situation factually as it was in this country and to develop that as the debate ensued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only delegates who took any significant interest in that debate were the ones from Malaysia and, indeed, they led the expressions of concern about the Hanson matter. The remainder of the delegates from the other countries simply stood back and allowed that discussion to proceed for something of the order of half an hour and indicated when it was concluded that they wished to get down to business discussing trade investment and like links. It was interesting to note that the delegates from all of the ASEAN countries were greatly aware of the Hanson debate and that Malaysia chose to pursue it with some vigour in the internal dialogue session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other main comment to make is that a range of delegates from Indonesia had expressed in both private and public forums 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8099"> great confidence in significant aspects of the Australian education system. A delegation from the Indonesian parliament had recently travelled along the east coast of Australia, looking at technical and advanced training, and the delegates expressed the views that the TAFE system that was being used in this country was particularly appropriate to their country and that they needed to import mid&hyphen;level technical expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were of the view that the technology present in the United States and Europe, which a lot of the universities in those countries were attempting to sell, was simply inappropriate to Indonesia. The Indonesians had high regard, as a consequence of that, for the Australian education system and, in particular, the TAFE system. Other relevant comments may be found in the report, and I commend it to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY (SUPERVISION) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the `SIS Act'). The SIS Act regulates the conduct of trustees of superannuation entities to ensure the prudent management of superannuation moneys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the SIS Act will improve the flexibility of legislative requirements relating to the nature and timing of elections by superannuation funds to be regulated under the SIS Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be eligible to receive concessional taxation treatment a superannuation fund must elect to be regulated under the SIS Act. There are a number of steps involved in making an election including lodging a standard form with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and ensuring that the fund has a trustee that is a Constitutional corporation or that the sole or primary purpose of the fund is the provision of old&hyphen;age pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are strict time limits within which superannuation funds must elect to be regulated. A superannuation fund, established after the commencement of the SIS Act, must make an election to be regulated at the same time that it comes into existence or shortly after that day. A superannuation fund that was in existence prior to the commencement of the SIS Act must have elected to be regulated at the latest by the beginning of the fund's 1995&hyphen;96 year of income. A superannuation fund that was in the process of winding up after the commencement of its 1994&hyphen;95 year of income could continue to receive concessional taxation treatment without making an election to be regulated provided they were wound up by 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to elect within these strict time limits or to wind up by the prescribed date may result in the members of the fund suffering losses due to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8100"> removal of taxation concessions. In addition, given that there are a number of steps involved in making an election, a fund may inadvertently lodge a defective election. In this case, a fund is ineligible for taxation concessions until after they have made a valid election. This is despite the fact that the fund may have complied with the SIS Act and regulations in all respects apart from lodging a valid election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner previously dealt with the shortcomings in the election process by temporarily modifying the SIS Act under section 333. However, the Commissioner's temporary modification power expired on 1 July 1996. This bill amends the SIS Act to permanently reinstate the administrative flexibility which was previously achieved through the temporary modification declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the amendments will confer a discretion on the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to extend the time within which the lodgment of an election must be made with the Commissioner and enable trustees to rectify inadvertently invalid elections. The amendments will also address restrictive timing requirements for funds established prior to the SIS regime or funds who were in the process of winding up. By overcoming these technical rigidities, the amendments will enable superannuation funds who would otherwise be deprived of concessional taxation treatment in certain years to obtain access to such treatment, without compromising the security of members' benefits or fund compliance with the retirement income standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the amendments will take effect retrospectively from 1 July 1996 to ensure that the eligibility for taxation concessions for funds in the period prior to amendment is not jeopardised.</PARA>

The Government has considered these submissions and has taken them into account in finalising the legislation. The Government has made many modifications to the measures in response to concerns raised in the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main concerns raised was about the application of the income injection test to family trusts. In response to this concern the Government announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget that it would relax the application of the income injection test for family trusts but the definition of family member would be narrowed from the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget time.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recoupment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of the loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains a benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures achieve this aim by examining whether there has been a change in underlying ownership or control of a trust or whether certain schemes have been entered into in order to take advantage of a trust's losses or other deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax law already contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. The proposed rules that are to apply to trusts will differ in some respects from those that apply to companies, reflecting the different characteristics of trusts.</PARA>

Each type of trust has to satisfy certain tests relating to ownership or control of the trust in order to be able to deduct prior and current year losses and debt deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, while fixed trusts will be subject to a continuity of ownership test, non&hyphen;family discretionary trusts will be subject to continuity of ownership, continuity of control and pattern of

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special rules will also apply to widely held unit trusts so that ownership will be tested generally only where there are abnormal transactions. These rules will help to minimise compliance costs for these types of trust. Also, a listed widely held unit trust can apply the same business test if it fails the continuity of ownership test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special tracing rules are provided to overcome difficulties in monitoring ownership of trust interests where certain entities are interposed between the loss trust and the underlying beneficiaries. A special tracing rule applies for family trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These tests do not apply to family trusts, some superannuation funds, deceased estates within a reasonable administration period and unit trusts with unit holders exempt from income tax. These trusts are called excepted trusts in the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, there are two bills in the legislation package which will corporatise the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority: the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997; and the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victorian governments to establish a new company to operate and maintain the Snowy Mountains Scheme&mdash;Snowy Hydro Limited. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 repeals and amends various acts of parliament arising from the termination of the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation complements corporatisation legislation introduced into the New South Wales parliament on 29 May 1997 and legislation expected to be introduced into the Victorian parliament in September 1997. The Snowy Mountains Authority cannot be corporatised until all three pieces of legislation have been proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, most Australians would be aware that the snowy scheme is an integrated water and hydro&hyphen;electric power project situated in the Kosciuszko National Park. Through a unique and complex example of engineering technology water is diverted west to the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems for irrigation, producing renewable electricity through a complex integrated infrastructure which includes sixteen major dams, seven power stations, 145 kilometres of interconnected tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. The snowy scheme is the largest supplier of renewable energy in mainland Australia. Hydro power is truly "green power", which does not produce the emissions associated with coal or gas, and there are strong indications that renewable power may attract a premium in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been consistent support for corporatisation of the snowy scheme by successive Commonwealth and state governments, for a number of very good reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant is to ensure that the benefits of competition reform in Australia's electricity industry can be accessed by the snowy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electricity industry is a very large and important sector, with assets of well over A$50 billion and some 45,000 employees. Its annual sales to 7.8 million customers raised A$12 billion in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Electricity is a key input for all Australian industries, accounting for between 5 and 30 per cent of input costs. Over the past two decades electricity use has increased by some 5 per cent a year. Structural and competition reforms in the electricity supply industry have the potential to reduce electricity prices to industrial users by over 25 per cent and thereby enhance Australia's international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the importance of improving efficiencies in this industry, governments have worked co&hyphen;operatively to introduce a competitive electricity market in southern and eastern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The snowy scheme is already important in the overall electricity market. Although the scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8103"> provides only 5 per cent of New South Wales, Victorian, South Australian energy output, it has a number of unique strengths. It is a rapid response electricity generator, which can specialise in providing peak power to the market. It has an important reserve capacity role which provides insurance to the whole industry, because the snowy can respond instantly to cover the sudden loss of large coal and gas fired generating units. In particular, in the event of a complete or partial grid blackout, the snowy provides a "black start" service of restarting the electrical system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national market has recently commenced. Competitive trading arrangements will evolve progressively as the market develops, with the transition to a fully competitive national market expected to be completed by 2000. The commencement of the market has served to highlight that an important contribution to the development of the national market will be the creation of a competitive snowy generator, which will provide a greater depth of competition to other generators, and the separation of the snowy's current transmission business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under its current legislation, the snowy scheme is precluded from operating commercially in the national market. While New South Wales and Victoria have responded to the introduction of the competitive market by establishing a company to trade electricity entitlements from the snowy scheme, this does not allow the pricing arrangements enshrined in the current legislation to be varied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently the operating costs of the authority are met by the electricity authorities of NSW, Victoria and the ACT, with no retained earnings. The current legislation requires that electricity is charged for at net cost of production, regardless of the prevailing market price. This does not allow the snowy to maximise its output of high priced peak power. Corporatisation will allow the scheme to change from cost based to profit based operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other important reasons to reform the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dual management system which currently governs the operations of the snowy scheme has become outdated and inefficient. The Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority, a Commonwealth Statutory Authority, has responsibility for the day to day management of operations. The Snowy Mountains Council, which directs the operations of the snowy scheme's electricity generation, as well as water storage and release operations, comprises representatives from New South Wales and Victorian electricity and water bodies, and the Commonwealth. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This two tier decision making process does not provide the single management focus necessary to take snowy forward as a competitive and efficient trader of energy services in the national electricity market. When this legislation is proclaimed, governance of the scheme will transfer to a chairman and chief executive officer and a board of directors operating under corporations law and as set down in its memorandum and articles of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, Corporatisation will enable the accelerated repayment to the Commonwealth of advances provided to fund the construction of the scheme. This debt to the Commonwealth has a face value of $820 million and a current value of around $740 million. Without reform the debt would not be fully repaid until the year 2027.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, some public concern has been expressed that corporatisation of the snowy scheme will establish a corporate entity which is then capable of being privatised. It is acknowledged that the Victorian government&mdash;which has largely privatised its electricity supply industry&mdash;has publicly indicated its intention to privatise its snowy entitlement as soon as possible. The NSW government has recently also stated its intention to privatise its electricity industry undertakings, including its 58 per cent share of the snowy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth government supports the corporatisation and privatisation of publicly owned electricity generators, distributors and transmission systems. We are investigating options to sell the Commonwealth's 13 per cent equity in the snowy to Victoria or NSW to simplify the governance arrangements when the scheme is corporatised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether or not the Commonwealth sells its equity, the future ownership of the scheme will be finally determined by the major equity shareholders&mdash;NSW and Victoria. The Commonwealth has therefore placed a high priority on ensuring that the arrangements to corporatise the scheme recognise the community interests in the future of the snowy scheme. This interest is many faceted, reflecting the scheme's location in a national park; its significance as part of Australia's multicultural heritage; as well as its role as a significant source of the irrigation water on which our agricultural sector is so dependent. Regardless of the future ownership arrangements for the scheme these interests must be properly acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key element of the legislation package is the schedule to the explanatory memorandum, which contains the Corporatisation principles agreed between the commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8104">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These principles, which provide the framework for Corporatisation, deal with the critical areas agreed between governments before legislation could be developed. These include: the formation, equity holdings, corporate governance and staffing arrangements for the company; water arrangements for the company; the establishment of a water inquiry to examine environmental flows in rivers in the scheme's catchments; the regulatory arrangements which will be imposed on the company by the nsw government; and the company's liability for taxation and state tax compensation arrangements. Under the corporatisation principles Snowy Hydro Limited will assume the authority's debt to the Commonwealth. The three governments are committed to the refinancing of the Commonwealth's debt in the snowy scheme shortly after Corporatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments have agreed that Snowy Hydro Limited will be incorporated in New South Wales, as this is where the snowy scheme is geographically situated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle purposes of Snowy Hydro Limited will be to: generate electrical energy and market that energy and related services on a strictly commercial basis in the national electricity market; operate on a financially viable basis and in accordance with corporate plans approved by its members; and to undertake any future developments and operations that are commercially viable and that are agreed by the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Snowy Hydro Limited will be the sole employer for the scheme and all Snowy Mountains Authority staff will be offered the opportunity to transfer to the company. Those who do transfer to the company will carry over their Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes and various other accrued entitlements. Access to Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes will continue until such time as government ownership ceases. At that stage Commonwealth superannuation benefits may be preserved. Wages and conditions of service will also be carried over to the new corporation. Future changes to future wages and conditions can be subsequently negotiated under the government's new industrial relation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I have already alluded to the snowy scheme's importance as a water supplier to inland Australia. By diverting water west of the great dividing range, the snowy scheme plays an important role in agricultural production and river management, including flood mitigation, flow augmentation during drought and the control of salinity in the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. To achieve this, water has been diverted from other river systems, such as the snowy river. The community is now questioning whether the develop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of the snowy scheme adequately acknowledged the impact of reduced flows in other rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the broader level, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a process for water industry reform in Australia at its meeting on 11 April 1995. Of particular relevance to the corporatisation of the snowy scheme is the agreement by governments that the environment is a legitimate user of water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">governments have taken these concepts seriously. A water inquiry is to be held before the scheme is corporatised. The inquiry will examine issues arising from the current pattern of water flows in the rivers and streams within and flowing from the snowy mountains area, resulting from the operation of the scheme. The commonwealth has agreed that New South Wales and Victoria, as the two states which have principal responsibility for snowy scheme water management, will jointly sponsor the public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry will be conducted by a single commissioner, appointed by NSW and Victoria and will report within six months, followed by a two month period to agree a final outcome. Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreement on the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any outcome on environmental flows can only be determined in light of the finding of the water inquiry. The inquiry will allow the views of all interested parties to be considered&mdash;irrigators, environmental interests and other downstream users of water. Until then there is no valid basis on which governments can take any action to alter water allocations from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">governments have been unfairly accused of taking no notice of calls for increased environmental flows for the snowy river. To respond only to the views of one interested group in advance of a public water inquiry&mdash;particularly by legislating for environmental flows in the snowy river&mdash;would clearly disenfranchise other legitimate interests in the inquiry from the decision making process. governments have not been prepared to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important that the potential financial impacts of any changed water arrangements impacting on Snowy Hydro Limited be identified before the corporatisation legislation is proclaimed. This will ensure that the company is established on a sound commercial basis and can operate in the competitive national electricity market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, there are other environmental aspects to the scheme's location in Kosciuszko National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following corporatisation, Snowy Hydro Limited will be subject to New South Wales environmental and planning law. To comply with the existing New South Wales regulatory regime, the company 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8105"> will be required to prepare a corporate environmental management plan, which establishes minimum environmental standards, remediation programs, performance targets, management controls and compliance checks and timetables.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the KNP, the sensitivity of the alpine environment and conservation status of the park means that it will not be sufficient for Snowy Hydro Limited to simply operate in accordance with the normal nsw environmental regulatory regime. After Corporatisation, snowy hydro limited's continued operation of the national park will be through a New South Wales lease and licence which will contain enforcement provisions in respect of a KNP environmental management plan. Snowy Hydro Limited also has significant incentive to ensure that its environmental performance is impeccable as it will be entering the market as a provider of "clean, green energy".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, this package of measures is designed to formally take the snowy mountains scheme into the competitive national electricity market. It is essential that this step be taken to provide important and necessary competition and to reform the corporate governance of the scheme. In so doing the government is confident that the new arrangements safeguard the important environment and conservation status of the KNP and can address any potential impact that may have occurred regarding the snowy river.</PARA>

The letter, I will repeat for the third time, is from the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs to Mr Fred Wren. I am happy to have the letter tabled. In that letter he points out that he is writing to advise Mr Wren of the position the government has taken in relation to the use of processed waste oil blended with diesel in certain remote power stations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the tariff act included in the Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendment) Act would have the effect of requiring products to arrive from the recycling of waste oil to be marked if they were to be sold for use otherwise than as a fuel in an internal combustion engine and hence be duty free or otherwise pay excise at the detailed rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation means that if such products are to be sold excise free they must be marked. However, under the legislation, such marked fuel cannot be blended with fully excise paid diesel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just take up the minister's assertion that burning waste oil is to deal with it in an environmentally defensible manner. It is not. It is environmentally reprehensible to be burning waste oil in a country which has the technology for recycling that oil. The problem is that for those people who are trying to recycle oil every impediment is thrown in their way, not least the failure of government to give the sort of backing to recycling technology in this country that is given to the big oil companies and oil importers. There is a process in Tasmania which has got, not to the drawing board stage but to the refinery stage, but has failed to get the bridging finance to allow that refinery to get under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you recycle oil, you put it back into commercial use and you therefore forgo the use of new oil, often imported oil. You forgo the conversion of the so&hyphen;called waste oil into simply a burning process, which has all the environmental detriments, including greenhouse gas production. Let me go through that again. When you recycle oil instead of using new oil, you have the advantage of not duplicating the use of a fossil fuel. There is in this country the technology for recycling 95 per cent of oil, that is, stripping it right back to its refined state so it is available for the addition of specific components which lead to oil being used in 18 different end uses in this country. You forgo the need to import oil thereby. But the world's best technology is available in this country; it is available in Tasmania. It has to overcome the impediment of the institutional big oil companies simply wanting to sell more oil and the waste going to be either burned or dumped in the environment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot credit why it is that in 1997 Australia has not got behind the new industries. I cannot credit why we have not taken up the options in Europe, including Finland, where there has been an incentive to recycle oil through taxation for nearly a decade now. It is an incentive brought in by the Finnish Greens. Australia is at the back of the pack there. We do import an enormous amount of oil. It would be environmentally sensible for us to recycle that oil to reduce imports. But, above all, if you are an economic rationalist, you should look at the improvement in the balance of payments when you recycle oil and you do not have to import new oil.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the minister is not answering because the government is not doing anything, and that is the point I was trying to draw out. So there we have it&mdash;the government is not doing anything, by the minister's own admission, on the matter of giving incentives to this recycling industry to stop the profligate dumping in the environment and burning of used oil in this country. This bill closes a loophole but it is not good enough to leave it there. We should be insisting in 1997 that the government has in train incentives for those people who are recycling oil, and big disincentives&mdash;taxes&mdash;on those people who are not recycling oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a mammoth problem. Let me reiterate to Senator Parer that it is not just an environmental matter&mdash;because I know that is not going to get the minister interested&mdash;it is a very important economic and employment matter. Recycling of oil in this country creates jobs in this country to substitute for the import of oil from elsewhere around the planet. It has a massive beneficial incentive in terms of balance of payments. That appears to be flying right over the minister's head. He is being dismissive of it. It is important to bring forward that point in this debate. As I say again, I was tripped into action on this by the minister's brush-off statement that the burning of oil is dealing with it in an environmentally defensible manner. The burning and dumping of oil in the environment&mdash;and he says 70 per cent of oil used in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8109"> this country goes that way&mdash;is environmentally indefensible and is economically plain bad management.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement that the minister made just then&mdash;that is, that this bill, in the government's mind, is not about the issues that Senator Brown and I have been canvassing&mdash;is probably a very true statement. Because this is an impact of the bill, the government does not want it on their agenda. The minister does not want it on his agenda; he would like not to have to deal with it. This is why, as I say, over three weeks we have tried to deal with the issue, tried to be reasonable and tried to get some sort of reasonable response from the government. We found out today, through their hairy&hyphen;chested behaviour, that they have decided they are going to do a crash or crash through without even the niceties of talking through the issues and without giving us the chance to talk to the industries. Isn't it funny that when there are industries that the government likes or supports everything stops to make sure that those industries are fully advised. But it seems to me that perhaps this industry is persona non grata with the government. Perhaps all the statements about fossil fuels that the government makes about wanting to do its best by the environment and small industry mean zilch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to bring this home, I will quote a paragraph from a letter from Mr Fred Wren from Wren Oil to Senator Ellison as minister for customs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a law abiding member of society I would like to quote from my first letter to you. Obviously the large oil companies want government support to prevent the small recyclers such as Wren Oil from blending and marketing diesel and want the federal government to bring in legislation towards that end. We believe that we should have equal right to purchase tax paid new diesel from whomever can supply it to us. We should be able to blend it with our own recycled products for resale or on-sell the oil to whomever wants to buy and use it for whatever purpose they want. It should be the open market that determines the end user, not legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even should the government provide, say, Wren Oil in Western Australia with certain grandfathered exemptions&mdash;sunsetted exemptions&mdash;for sale to remote areas such as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Broome, Derby, Exmouth or Esperance, that has not dealt with other companies in the rest of Australia. That does not deal with the medium- or long-term issue of whether this government is serious about encouraging the recycling of oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that, in answer to Senator Brown's question, the minister is saying `Well, my answer to you as to whether we are assisting industry in recycling is that that industry already exists,' is a nonsense, a total nonsense. If what is happening damages the oil recycling industry then this government is doing the exact opposite of assisting that industry. Not only are they imposing a large cost on that industry they are also imposing a large cost on society. Even if all recycled oil was blended with fuel and sold without excise, the result would be small in relation to the total excise on oil. The percentage of waste oil used in the problematic blending is currently small, though it poses a potential problem. The percentage of waste oil collected and recycled is large. Anything that works against the industries involved creates a potentially large problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the fact that the soils in Perth where I live in Western Australia are mainly sandy makes disposal of waste oil difficult and contamination of ground water very likely. The fact that Perth and most Western Australian cities and towns are coastal and frequently sited on rivers and estuaries&mdash;and we have just had a debate about marine and coastal pollution&mdash;means that the disposal of waste water will pollute riverine, estuarine and marine coastal environments. So, if these are the government's actions in relation to these things, all the nice statements written in the marine and coastal pollution studies mean zilch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are issues about public utilities and the cost of remote and rural power generation relative to urban grid based power. But you say, `Leave that to the market'&mdash;except that we are going to stop the market from operating in this particular instance. We have already supported conversion to renewable resources of power for many of these stations. But we also recognise that this is a government decision. In the meantime, any move to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8110"> make rural power more expensive, coupled with measures to eliminate cross-subsidies in the name of competitiveness, will penalise rural people, with no benefit to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of collection of waste is substantial. It is currently borne by the private sector. If it is not borne by this sector, it will have to be borne by the public sector&mdash;probably state or local government, who will also have to figure out how to dispose of it. And how are you going to subsidise them? It will probably be put into pits and industrial waste dumps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of increased excise from recycled oil will be borne by users of state electric power&mdash;in Western Australia, the customers of Western Power. The cost in Western Australia will be borne by Western Australians in a multiple fashion: they will bear the cost of the increase in power due to the increased cost of fuel; they will bear the cost of the increased need to collect and deal with waste oil; and they will bear the cost of the increase in environmental degradation from inappropriate disposal of waste oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have set your priorities. But perhaps you might like to give something to the industry to put their mind at rest. Can you guarantee, and can you state now, that regulations will be drafted to the satisfaction of the industry that I am talking about&mdash;that is, the recycling industry&mdash;at the very least, to exempt the sale of oil for blending with fuel from excise where that blended oil is sold to provide remote power to areas like Broome, Derby, Exmouth or Esperance power stations? And, of course, I am not wanting to restrict that to Western Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I should make the opposition's position on this matter clear. I raised in my address in the second reading debate some of the questions that have been canvassed which now have taken the more personalised form of guarantees to Wren Oil. I might say that, in the first instance, I do think the Greens have a point about the tardy way in which the government has gone about actually giving those guarantees. Guarantees that could have been given earlier would have resolved the issue of the delay we are now experiencing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because of debate on this matter, and it is unfortunate that there was that delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having that said, the guarantees I think have now been given in a manner which assuages the concerns that were raised by the opposition. Therefore, I am happy to vote for this bill in the committee stage and in the third reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does bemuse me to some extent is the debate that we now are engaged in, which is a peripheral debate to the main issue that is before the chamber but one that is connected&mdash;and I can see the connection, and I am not arguing that it is not related. The confusion stems from my understanding of the Greens's position. My understanding of the Greens's position is that they favour a carbon tax. Here we have an amendment circulated in the name of Senator Margetts which actually provides a holiday of five years for people who might be blending oil for use in rural power stations which would have attracted the carbon tax. In policy terms, I cannot clearly understand what exactly the Greens are on about. It seems to me that you cannot call for a carbon tax, on one hand, and then provide a tax holiday for the burning of oil, which would produce carbon into the atmosphere, on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I think there is a tendency to talk in glowing terms about the oil recycling business. I too would like to talk in glowing terms about it because recycling of oil, I think, is a very worthwhile thing, and an oil dependent nation like Australia is one that ought to have refined that art to a high art form and then maybe more than 30 per cent of our consumption needs could be supplied. But I do not think we ought to run away with ourselves that there are not costs to the environment in recycling oil; there are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is cost to the environment in collecting it and bringing it to one central point for processing. Then there is the cost in gas emissions for the energy consumed in cleaning it and blending it. Also, since it is a replacement for oil that would have been burned anyway in a power station, you still get the same level of greenhouse gas emissions that you would have got whatever the source of the oil, whether recycled or original.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8111">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not see the argument in those clear terms; I know that these are peripheral to the main point. I just wanted to make those observations. But just to return to the central issue here: tardy though they be and, unfortunately, late though they are, nonetheless the undertakings seem to be satisfactory to us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook seems to have missed the point altogether. Waste oil often gets burnt off or dumped. If waste oil is not recycled and cleaned up and used again, it is not going to help the greenhouse because perhaps more of it will be wasted into the environment in various ways, including simply burning it off and creating greenhouse gases. So the burning of it will probably happen anyway, and it probably will be burnt in a much more wasteful fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a issue of carbon tax. It is an issue of dealing with a particular type of recycling process in a way that makes it more and more difficult for companies to be involved with the recycling process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is about how you dispose of what is a non&hyphen;renewable resource in the most economic and environmentally smart way. The issue of a sunset clause still does not solve the problem in any reasonably thought&hyphen;out way. If there is a period of phasing out, it has not solved the problems or sorted out the situation for those industries. It just means they have a while to decide when they are going to close down, go out of business or whatever. It is about the long&hyphen;term issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What perhaps needs to be on the table now is a commitment to consider the Oil Recyclers Association of Australia's submission to exempt specific processed waste oil for uses of fuel, but to do this as a review of this bill to consider the long&hyphen;term impact on the waste oil recycling industry. If there is a sunset clause and if there is a commitment by the minister&mdash;I would like to hear those words from the minister&mdash;that these regulations will be drafted to the satisfaction of the recycling industry, which I do not think is unreasonable, there also needs to be a review to consider the long&hyphen;term impact of this bill on the waste oil recycling industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Chairman, it is very difficult to debate with a minister who will not be handling the reply. This is a quite serious piece of legislation. It is one that the government has trumpeted as being a keystone to its approach to raising the standards of parliamentary debate and of public scrutiny of the processes of government. I am drawn to the interjection that I heard a moment ago from Senator Margetts. If the government cannot manage its own legislative program, how can it be expected to manage this piece of legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is before the chamber is an amendment that I have moved. When I moved this amendment, I said with as much emphasis as I could muster that it is a very important amendment. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Page 11 (after line 25), after paragraph (da), insert:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(db) a report prepared by the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury of any material threats to the integrity of the tax system including the fiscal impact of these threats, and their best professional judgment of the specific means necessary to counter these threats;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In view of the minister's last remarks on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , I want to further ask why the government does not support an eminently reasonable amendment such as that. But, with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister not being here, I feel at cross&hyphen;purposes. I wonder whether there is any indication from the government benches how much longer the Senate chamber will have to wait. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once more say to the minister that this is a very serious amendment. This bill is entitled the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. As I have had cause to say during this debate thus far, it could easily be argued that it is mistitled; the proper title should be the `charter of budget dishonesty'. The government has proposed to the Australian people that it will provide a basis in which the policies of the major parties contesting the next election are transparent and that we can see and easily identify whether or not a party is making promises that will blow the budget through the roof. We can then remove, so the rhetoric surrounding this legislation asserts, the argument of who is right or who is wrong about the financial impacts of promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is fundamental, absolutely foundational, to any party rationally and sensibly being able to develop policies which will be costed and presented to the people so the effects can be seen is to know what the situation is with regard to revenue; that is, what the tax base is. We have to know whether there are substantial threats to the tax system in Australia as conceived of by the Commissioner of Taxation. He can tell the Treasurer (Mr Costello). Whether the Treasurer tells the people of Australia is another matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether the Treasurer is prepared to act if there are threats to the tax system is a matter that the electors of Australia should know about. They should know when they are casting their vote whether the tax system has integrity, whether it is fair. They should know that. The person who can tell them is the Commissioner of Taxation. He is statutorily independent of government, and he has the responsibility for minding the integrity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two things in taxation which get electors in this country upset. One is eternally&mdash;irrespective of what the level of taxation is&mdash;the level of taxation. But I suspect what more seriously gets them upset is whether people are rorting the system and getting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8115"> away unfairly with not shouldering their responsibilities in terms of the tax burden; whether someone over the other side is minimising their tax so that they or other electors have to pay more tax to compensate for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commissioner of Taxation maintains a monitoring of the integrity of the tax system. He knows what goes on. If we are having a charter of budget honesty in which voters at an election can see the economic impact of policies being presented by parties contending an election for the treasury bench, then electors have to be able to see whether the taxation system maintains its integrity, what the Commissioner of Taxation thinks about the integrity of the taxation system and whether the government is prepared to act to staunch a haemorrhage of the tax system, if there is one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is reasonable. I think any person you stopped in the street and asked whether or not they would want to know whether the taxation system was fair would say `yes'. So I do not know why it is that the government wants to oppose an amendment which would ensure that the people of Australia would find out that issue. The minister at the table has made a couple of forays in this debate but none of them, with the greatest of respect, has explained why it is that the government does not want to let the Australian people know the answer to that question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of other points. I thought I would make them all, rather than our going backwards and forwards like a ping pong debate, and then you can respond to the lot of them. In your responses to my previous propositions in this debate, which to some extent we are going through by way of synopsis now, you have got up and blackguarded the Labor Party when it was in power and said this, that and the other happened. All of that is interesting, much of it is quaint, a lot of it is political spin but none of it, with respect, has anything to do with what you do when you are in office and how you answer the proposition: why won't you let the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian people know whether or not there is a material threat to the tax base?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I wish to make in this debate and one that you might wish to reply to as well, Minister, is this proposition we have that parties are to submit the costings of their programs to Treasury so that the people of Australia will know what the real cost of the promises might be. Quite clearly, if the cost of a program is high and it imposes costs on the system which mean that a budget would go into a deficit rather than into surplus, that not only has to do with the measure being promoted but also has a bit to do with the level of revenue side of the budget, the level of income to the government. It may well be that the only way you can judge whether or not the impact of a given set of proposals pushes the fiscal barriers is whether or not the revenue side, the tax base, is properly handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a particular reason why this question ought to be put to you, Minister, and that is this: the last time we had a coalition government on the treasury bench in Australia the tax system in Australia became optional for the wealthy. They paid tax if they chose; they did not pay tax if they chose. I recall Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Minister, had an inquiry into the ship painters and dockers union which found the bottom of the harbour scam and many tax authorities in Australia argued with great force and considerable justification that taxation had become voluntary for the wealthy, which meant that ordinary Australians paid more because the wealthy got away with it for free or for negligible cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the last time, with the greatest of respect, your government presided over the tax system. Given your track record, on this occasion there is a particular reason why we do not want you to run away from this point and to answer it directly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make is that it is not unusual at election time for parties contending for high office to make promises about tax. Electors deciding how they cast their vote and what is believable about those promises need to know what the integrity of the existing system is and whether or not avoiders are getting away with it or whether avoiders are caught and pay their fair share. They do need to know that. That is why this amendment moved by the Labor Party is an important amendment. It is in the spirit of what the government has said is the purpose of this legislation. I know that the spirit is often departed from in practice but here is a chance to keep the spirit and the practice on the same wavelength.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook is very anxious to get some responses, and fair enough; that is why I am here. Seeing that the senator made quite a number of points, I will respond to them. Firstly, he is a bit worried that when I get up, I blaggard the Labor Party. I would say, Senator Cook, that in 60 per cent of your speech you were blaggarding your opponents. You were worried that we went back to history, and then you went back to the Fraser period. You set up a principle and then three sentences later, you completely ignored the principle you set up. You decided to trap us through history&mdash;which you are entitled to&mdash;but if you are going to trap us 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through history, don't complain if other people do. That is the point that I am making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I can list a whole host of answers to the really highly political points that Senator Cook made. I will not take the time of the committee because I think this is an important bill. All I say is that if the Labor Party wants to dish it out, it has to be able to take it. A lot of us feel that the Labor Party does have a bunch of glass jaws. This debate will show that when I get up and attack the Labor Party, it is in response to attacks that you have felt free to get up and make about the coalition. That is fair enough; that is political debate. Don't set up a principle and then completely ignore it the way you have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important in this debate to say that the charter already requires that material threats to the fiscal outlook be outlined in the statement of risks. I suggest that if you want to see how this is developed and applied, you should look at budget paper No. (1)&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget strategy and outlook 1997-98</EMPHASIS>. In that paper we look at the revenue side and the generous risks to the revenue. That starts on page 240. I will not take the committee through it, but it is a very long and detailed explanation of the material threats to the fiscal outlook. I think that some of those deal with tax minimisation and avoidance. Senator Cook, you asked me to respond to you. I am trying to respond to you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you can do that, but can you listen while you are also talking? In that statement of general risks, which I refer non-government senators to, there is a section on tax minimisation and avoidance. That is actually covered in the clause. Despite all those fine words, Senator Cook, we are looking at the risk to the revenue in quite substantive detail. I think I am correct in saying that it has never been done before. I am looking to my advisers and they are nodding. We have outlined the risks to the revenue. It would have been a help before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8117"> you made that speech if you had looked at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, your amendment goes one step further, the way I read it. Your amendment would draw to the attention of tax planners the weaknesses and anomalies in the tax law before the government has time to rectify them. In other words, what we are saying is that the substantive point you are making is covered in the legislation as it stands. You want to go further. You want the tax commissioner to outline every little scheme, like R&amp;D syndicates, for example, which you are a great booster for. That is what you want. The reality is that before any government came in to fix this up, the way your legislation stood, I am advised, it would provide a guidepost to tax planners. So it would actually produce a perverse result&mdash;it would actually produce the reverse of the result that you are seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will note that I have not risen to the debate and attacked the Labor Party's record on this, albeit it is an easy target. I draw the attention of senators to the way the statement of risks is outlined already. It is a very comprehensive statement of risks to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with Senator Cook's amendment is that it seems to me that it will just provide a guidepost for tax avoiders. I urge the committee to recognise that the substantive point is covered but the Senator Cook element goes far further. It would be like telling a burglar, for example, where the house is unlocked. The reality is that in tax law there is an industry out there which is seeking to constantly develop new schemes. It is an enormous effort of any government worth its salt to constantly attempt to close these schemes, like R&amp;D syndicates, and protect the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the Senate to recognise that the substantive point that Senator Cook has made is covered. But Senator Cook wants to go further. He wants the tax commissioner to outline in detail the particular areas which we think would act as a guidepost to tax planners. This would lead to a reverse result, the contrary to what Senator Cook is claiming.</PARA>

I would have thought the government has some obligation to the parliament and the people of Australia. Is there a reason why you would not want to tell them whether the house is unlocked so that something could be done about it? It seems bizarre that the tax office would keep those things secret and not want to pass them on so that political change and action could take place. And that is exactly the point I will be making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an interesting amendment in that it allows the officers of a departmental bureau to take what might be seen as political stands independent of government. Let us not make any mistakes: political choices are made, even in tax accounting and revenue estimates. As I said earlier, there is no such thing as an apolitical tax policy. Tax policy is not straight maths or entirely logical. It is about who should pay for social projects. Implicit in this is a debate about who benefits and how we want the distribution of economic resources to look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax policy is often explicitly about the redistribution of wealth. I say that this is implicit in the tax debate, but it used to be explicit. It used to be the substance of such debate. It has now become either a naive assumption about goals and direction in society or a hidden, unspoken agenda. Tax policy is also clearly political in the sense that decisions about how much tax to collect, and whether to tax or to lower taxes, reflect political value decisions about the role of the public sector and, of course, about the role of government. Is it a burden on society? Is the only purpose of government a minimalist regulatory one&mdash;there are very few regulations at that&mdash;or is government the collective social body for attaining a common good? Is the role to provide public control of areas of life which affect all people&mdash;such as the provision of water and power, communications and a monetary system&mdash;in ways that reflect the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8118"> purpose and values of the community? Is the goal to eliminate the profit margin on necessities, a margin which goes into private pockets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are highly political areas. We are asking the Australian Taxation Office to determine its own agenda to a certain extent, to identify what it sees as threats, needs and solutions and to present them to the public without regard for the views or policies of government or opposition. We are asking the ATO to become a political player in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of taxation, I think it would be fine to allow the tax office to highlight their issues. I think every department should be allowed to highlight their issues. I do not see it as the right of the education department to highlight threats or proposed remedies although, clearly, budgetary policies have been the primary threat to education and the department is often told to be quiet&mdash;but wouldn't it be nice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary argument for singling out the Australian Taxation Office to directly enter public politics is that the tax base itself is the basis for allowing all other departments to fulfil both regulatory duties and social goals in terms of program provision. A secondary feature is that independent and public political information on tax may throw into high relief areas that the government may not have the backbone to address. As to the point about telling the burglar where the house is unlocked, areas like negative gearing, transfer pricing and the various rorts of corporations and the rich might be areas the government wants to stay unlocked&mdash;you never know. This is attractive, given the prevalence of these amongst the rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary argument against this amendment is that the Australian Taxation Office cannot be trusted to run a socially progressive political agenda. Why do I say that? My experience colours my view. We have seen the Australian Taxation Office argue the threat to revenue in terms of Commonwealth scholarships. They came up with `remedies' in the form of draft rulings on service that would effectively exclude the majority of Commonwealth postgraduate scholarship 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holders. We have seen them argue that broad shotgun approaches to taxation of trusts, which would negatively affect huge numbers of small business people&mdash;to whom it was recommended they set up as trusts&mdash;were necessary to catch big business rorters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that big business rort trusts, and I have concerns for small business that are not rorting. Somewhere there needs to be more consideration than we need to get the baddies no matter what the cost to others. I do not see that in the ATO advice. I worry that the Australian Taxation Office will focus on a simple revenue preservation agenda without looking at the social impacts of taxation or how tax can be constructed to maximise social benefit through the targeting of tax and tax incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I worry that the Australian Taxation Office will be seen as giving independent and objective advice when, in fact, they are giving political advice without making their social and political objectives clear. I guess they will not state in advance which factional party they might support. I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that I have supported governments acting where the tax office has identified a legitimate rort. I have been happy to see action taken on things like negative gearing. But negative gearing is not news and the failure to act has been because of a lack of political will, not because people do not know about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will support this amendment because it will make it more difficult to ignore tax rorts at the big end of town. I want to make sure it is noted that I support it with some reservations. My reservations are really along the line of why I dislike this bill. I think it is a bad sign to support the pretence that budgets are purely economic and that economics is somehow just about money or is somehow or other scientific. This particular amendment may be all right since it is liable to show up deficiencies in terms of what those with considerable capital can get away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our problem is that the tax office often have other targets. Their recommendations, like eliminating tax exemptions for scholarship holders, have implications that are certainly socially negative. The damage to our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8119"> pool of educated people and to research will have economic implications, too. I do not have the faith that they will be picked up by any measure in the government's bill or by any amendments to this bill other than, potentially, Senator Murray's amendments Nos 3 and 6. Therefore, I tentatively support the ALP's amendment No. 4.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to Senator Cook's exposition of the virtues of his amendment and to the response of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). What went through my mind when listening to it&mdash;apart from the competitiveness that exists between the two sides&mdash;is the fact that in tax systems and in questions of tax integrity there is very little that is new under the sun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the latest count of countries in this world of ours is 202. Tax systems, how they operate and the changes and threats to them are very widely discussed. I wondered what possible threat there could be from embarking upon a transparent approach to our tax system where nothing is hidden&mdash;there are no secret taxes, secret revenues or secret systems&mdash;everything goes through the parliament and everything is published and reported normally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone is well aware of the very material shifts that have occurred in our economy. For instance, it is why the Australian Democrats focus very heavily on financial transactions and the shift to foreign ownership and what that means. It is why the previous government, this government and we focus very much on transfer pricing. It is why we all are concerned with negative gearing, why we are concerned with trusts and why the government quite rightly has put tax reform on the agenda. We are aware of the way in which the whole tax system has changed and the fact that we need to re-evaluate where we place our emphasis and how we deal with it. On the basis of the natural attractions of an open and mature debate about these things, I would have thought that transparency was in our interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I had a look at the risk statement that you spelt out and it occurred to me, with the kind of view I have in mind, that this amendment actually adds to your intention. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have given you praise for embarking upon this course. I think the only thing we are most offended by is the lack of enforceability. This amendment will add a balanced and more holistic overview of the fiscal implications from your reports. I would have thought it adds to your bill and does not take away anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If indeed you have fears and those fears are realised, the very first report will expose those fears. I must say that, without particularity from you, I am unable to conceive of a situation where there is any real danger from the acceptance of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the case made is a good one. I thought your example of the burglar and so on was possibly a little extravagant, given the lack of particularity about the possibility of any real threat resulting from an open debate in a world where that goes on a great deal anyway in analytical and academic terms. So my inclination is to support the amendment unless you can find some astonishing reason as to why Senator Cook's case is not persuasive.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only reason I rise is that I sought the call earlier to reply to the substantive point that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, made when he replied earlier. Short of all of the rhetoric in this debate, what I understood you, Senator Kemp, to say was that, if my amendment is carried, then the tax office will expose what it understands to be schemes that rort the system&mdash;tipping off people who may wish to rort the system. That was your substantive argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with that. With the greatest respect, that argument is wrong. What happens now? There is a whole industry out there devoted to working out how to rort the tax system&mdash;how to get around it, how to minimise it. It discovers what it believes to be a loophole, it informs its clients, and off they go and minimise their tax&mdash;or rort the system; whichever way you want to describe that. The tax office picks it up after the event, after rorters have had a free reign for a time. The real threat to the integrity of the tax system becomes apparent to the tax office. Those with the privilege of the exclusive knowledge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8120"> about the loophole are able to exploit it to their own advantage before the tax office operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I think that that is the way it operates. Secondly, I think the tax office is counterpunching here. It is not exposing something in advance. It is exposing a practice that is current. Thirdly, and most importantly, our governments, if they are so moved, then issue a press release saying, `This is a problem with the tax base and we will legislate from this point to close off this loophole.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we all knew what the particular schemes were&mdash;in an election context, bear in mind, that is where this debate is occurring&mdash;there would be a greater responsibility of the contending political parties to make sure that they announce that the integrity of the tax system would be protected. I do not want to make this as a cynical, snide point, but let me make it frankly and straight to you: I cannot understand why a Treasurer would not want the backing of public opinion to strengthen his arm in closing loopholes, particularly when the public of Australia is paying attention in an election campaign, unless it is that he is derelict, slow to act or has something else to hide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think in terms of the public's need to know what the avoiders are up to&mdash;I was going to say what the bastards are up to&mdash;that it is a basic question of how well you police the system, and that is something that electors are entitled to make up their minds about. So I say, first of all, that the sequence of events is that the avoidance occurs and the response from the Taxation Office follows. Whether the government acts then is at its discretion, but the electors do need to know what the schemes are, and there is a capacity to legislate back to the time of the press release or, in extraordinary circumstances, even further back to cut out the ill&hyphen;gotten gains of this avoidance and deter people from going down that route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I wish to raise is that you, Senator Kemp, said that it is dealt with in the budget papers in any case so we do not need to go any further. I have the budget papers before me, in particular Budget Paper No. 1, and I am looking at page 2&hyphen;40, which is head 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed `Revenue' and `General risks'. It lists a number of general risks to the revenue: `Tax Minimisation and avoidance'&mdash;and it says a bit about that; `Financial innovation'; `internationalisation'; `communications technology'; `PAYE arrangements and personal services income'; `The tax treatment of trusts'; `community expenditure patterns', `Court decisions'; and `Tax expenditures'. It then goes to some specific risks, but it does not go to the sorts of schemes that ought to be stamped out. It just goes in a general way to the concerns. I think that, if this Charter of Budget Honesty is going to be able to present to the people of Australia a transparent way of understanding what the detail is, the amendment that I propose ought to be carried.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly respond to Senator Cook's remarks. Tax law and tax avoidance are perhaps more complex than Senator Cook gives credence to, as indeed is the solution to it. Let us say a R&amp;D syndicate type scheme emerges and comes to the attention of the tax office during an election period. This is brought to the attention of the contending parties. How many weeks go by? Three or four? It is a close election and the government is not formed until perhaps a month after the election. So perhaps two months have elapsed and a scheme that may well have proposed very substantial risk to the revenue is available for the tax planners and those who perhaps have not cottoned on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook is quite right. Some of these schemes are often put to particular clients. Suddenly the press might reveal an area where tax avoidance can occur with very large sums of money involved. But the sequence of events then arises that one person's tax avoidance is not another person's. The debate on R&amp;D syndicates was a classic case of that. We cracked down and you opposed it. Of course, in the end the government was successful in stopping what we regarded as a rort of the system over the heads of the Labor Party, I suspect due to the assistance of a variety of non&hyphen;government senators. So the situation is not quite as straightforward as Senator Cook might claim it to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that some schemes may have been known before but they are difficult to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8121"> close; some may emerge to the knowledge of the tax office during a particular period. We are saying that the general risks that we put down are miles ahead of anything any government has ever proposed before. I know Senator Cook is very cynical of this bill, and those who know a bit about political history would understand why he is. We welcome the support of the Democrats for this bill and the recognition that this is a very big step forward. Of course, this was stimulated by the performance of the previous government and its cover&hyphen;ups before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to Senator Cook that this is a complex argument. There will be cases where this will certainly lead to signposts, and it may not be possible or practical to close them off before these schemes are really rorted in a huge way. The one thing on which Senator Cook is correct is that there is a big industry out there and people are working very hard because there is a lot of money at stake. This government is proud of its record of cracking down on tax avoidance, and it has often had to make these crackdowns over the head of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Murray to note what I have said. When you see how these things develop, you see that the picture that is being painted in this chamber is too simple; it does not recognise the complexity of how these things develop, how they spread into the public arena and the possible risk. We think the substantive point is well covered and that it should be given a chance. We think there are some risks in what has been proposed. I would urge non&hyphen;government parties to reject this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Kemp, I cannot recall all the figures, but let me try to give some particularity to your examples. Let me use syndication as an example: you will recall that your government did make the decision; you will recall that the Senate reviewed the matter and that, as a consequence of that review, it was debated and the government bill was passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may also recall that at no time was syndication ever regarded as illegal. Syndication was always legal and the allegation of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rorting in the illegal sense of it was never proven; it was very difficult to substantiate. You were given, as they would say in law, the benefit of the doubt. That is why your bill passed, because we thought you had made a good enough case that the potential was there to threaten the integrity of the system and we were not getting the benefits out of it. I do not want to recap that, but let us assume that this reporting process had been in place prior to that. Let us assume that the report had said, `Look, parliament and people, we have here a situation where $600 million of taxable income is at risk. We believe that the way in which the system is running is not producing benefits that warrant the cost to the tax system and, accordingly, the government intends to consider closing down the system.' So what? What would have happened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are dealing with gigantic sums of money which involve careful integration of very complex schemes, regardless of how clever and capable the industry is that deals with these things, they cannot rush off and, in a few weeks or months, turn the entire system upside down. The syndication example would be very true of that. Those were complex, long&hyphen;term and very difficult financial systems to structure and put together. They could not be put together very simply and very quickly because they had to relate to practical business events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using your own example, whilst I think I understand where you are coming from I cannot see, in the particularity of the example you give, that we arrive in a situation where the government would have been disadvantaged or have been put at any great risk if, at election time, you said, `We do not like the syndicate system and we are going to close it down.' I really cannot see that the result would have been major damage to the exchequer or anything else. In fact, it would have made for a very enjoyable debate during the election period. So whilst I understand the points you are making, Minister, I am not persuaded by them and I will support Labor's amendment.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Democrats' amendment No. 4 on sheet 664 revised is in the same kind of arena that the whole debate is in, and that is expressing yourself in an election campaign and thereafter being held to account in terms of what you said. Amendment No. 4 to schedule 1, clause 12, adds a paragraph on a fiscal statement of election promises. A former leader of ours, one of the last of the six we have had, said that the government had made $18 billion worth of promises and kept $6 billion; or maybe she said they kept $12 billion of them. I cannot recall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that it is a tradition in Australian political history&mdash;maybe in all political systems&mdash;to make promises that are not kept, and this clause will provide the electorate with an easy guide on what the government of the day has done or has failed to do in keeping their election promises. Parliamentary secretaries and sometimes governments feel with good cause that they cannot keep an election promise, and I think the electorate is fairly forgiving of that sort of thing; otherwise they would not return governments to office a second time around. But there are many times when they are not too forgiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attraction of such a reporting requirement is plain. It is about information, transparency and accountability. It will mean that the electorate will be provided with the opportunity to have their memory jogged, to be able to see what was said and what its result has been, and governments will not be able to rely on the fact that after three years in office the electorate will not remember what it was they were promised at the last electorate and what the promises were that the government did not keep. Also, to the advantage of the government, they will not have an opposition of the day running round making claims that the government did not do things which in fact you might have done or could not do. It will turn claim and counter&hyphen;claim into a question of fact and how it is reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will, we think, be a particularly useful tool for the parliament and non&hyphen;government parties in scrutinising the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8123"> government and keeping the government accountable to the public. We think that is the essential task of parliament, and of the Senate in particular, and of the non&hyphen;government parties in any democracy. The adoption of this amendment will only enhance these roles. I therefore commend the amendment to the committee and hope that it will be another addition to what we have already said is a good bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, there is some element of attraction in this amendment, but it goes to the issue of mandate, and I have never actually gone along with that concept. It has never been my belief that people voted for, for instance, the Greens (WA) on the assumption that they would vote with whatever government it was that got elected based on what that particular party promised prior to an election. So on balance I find it difficult to actually wave in front of any government a statement saying, `These are the promises you have kept and these are the promises you have not kept,' on the basis that some promises are worthy and some are not, and I reserve the right to indicate that there are promises which should never have been made and therefore should never be kept in relation to what governments or parties say that they want to do affecting the electorate. Therefore I do not know whether it would be serving overall the interests of the electorate to support this amendment No. 4, though I do see the rationale for moving it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will support this amendment. I have two things to say about it. This is a way of keeping tabs on what promises are carried through once a government is elected. It would seem that the implication of this amendment is that each year, I imagine, the budget papers would contain a tally of what promises have been kept and what have not been kept. It may well be, as Senator Margetts says, that there are some promises that should not have been made, but they were and people may well have voted for the government on the basis of those promises. Whether they should have been made or not is a subjective judgment at the end of the day, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but if they were made and people voted, then they are entitled to know what the outcome was. Whether or not they have a different view later on, they are still entitled to know what the outcome was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have it in my memory that after the 1993 election the Labor Party produced a statement saying what election promises we had kept. Certainly the current government published a document, `Meeting our commitments', after the last election saying what promises they had kept, and arguing in their own party documentation that promises had been kept. Some of them were a bit political in terms of how they were argued&mdash;for example, it was argued that they had kept their promises to the ABC despite making a cut. But the point about this is that the Labor Party and the coalition have produced this sort of audit on themselves and because they are self-nominated audits there is, for the cynic, some element of question as to how accurate they are. This amendment would put it beyond the party into a more impartial medium for auditing and therefore make it more useful. I support the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition believes that this amendment is ultra vires the intent of this piece of legislation. If you use Senator Murray's argument, which is that we should be judging a government's performance against its own election promises, this amendment would force us to break an election commitment because our election commitment was very much, as Senator Margetts alluded to, to have a charter of budget honesty that was quite specifically to look at our performance against a budget and a fiscal strategy. Political commitments in election campaigns and prior to them and in policies and manifestos cover a range of issues, some of which have fiscal impacts and some of which do not. I guess you would argue that for the ones that do not have fiscal impact you would just have `no fiscal impact' on the line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are tending to make the charter of budget honesty legislation so broad as to lose what we regard as its important central focus, and that is the government's performance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8124"> against its fiscal strategy, and how that is achieved, and also to assess those other matters&mdash;risks and so forth&mdash;that we debated earlier. We think that is important. We also think that, for political debate, there is very good accountability in each of the portfolio areas that are dealt with in government. There are a range of interest groups and media specialists who analyse whether a government is performing against certain goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know that in the policies I wrote in the areas of administrative services&mdash;Senator Kemp and I wrote that policy&mdash;property rationalisation, youth, and sport and recreation prior to the last election there are detailed points against which any of the people interested in those policies can go back and judge our performance. You will be able to see which specific policy commitments have been delivered, which are in the process of being delivered and others which have not been delivered at all. Senator Cook makes the point that there are areas where governments do not deliver the promises they make in opposition or prior to the election, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons. Sometimes you realise there are better ways to achieve the same sort of outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make is that in political debate, and with the assistance of an ever watchful electronic and printed media, there are very good ways of assessing whether or not a government is keeping its promises in a range of portfolio areas. We believe that to burden this piece of legislation with a requirement to report on a range of matters that do not necessarily have any sort of relationship to the fiscal or economic performance of the government, which is the focus of this legislation, would destroy the important focus of this legislation. So we urge honourable senators to vote against this clearly well intentioned but flawed amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel obliged to remind the Senate that in the lead&hyphen;up to this last federal election there was a very well orchestrated campaign by the now government, who were then in opposition wanting to form government, to make sure that when they put policies out&mdash;there was a very clever process&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">they gave them in rapid fire, very much under control, so that the fine details of what was being presented were not even available. I would be horrified at the concept of keeping the government to some of those things which never even got the chance to be seen in any detail or analysed before the election. That was certainly the case in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. It was a very clever process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the media realised that they left themselves in a bit of a difficult position&mdash;if they were following through and trying to cover each event each day they were being fed information only at the last minute, they did not have a chance to ask too many questions and the fine details came out at a stage when they were on to the next question. So the reality is that you can manipulate election campaigns to provide information which might or might not be considered a promise but which, in the end, is not really part of any decision that people make when they vote in the government. This is behind my level of cynicism in not wanting to jump in and support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done this deliberately because it is a feature of our political system that governments tend to run to more than one term.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has moved this amendment for the very simple reason that if a pre-election economic and fiscal report is to be published, then for it to be useful and contribute towards public debate in the context of an election campaign, it needs to be timely, and available as soon as the election is called. It should not just be used as a political tactic by the government of the day to advance its own political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the later such a report is released, the more beneficial this is to the government than it is to the opposition because it denies the opposition reasonable time in which to respond to the issues that the report has raised. In the context of budget 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8128"> honesty, such an approach is decidedly dishonest, as it denies the opposition and the public adequate time for scrutiny and adequate time for a response. It is, therefore, eminently sensible for such a report to be made public at the end of a normal parliamentary session or within five days of an election being called early.</PARA>

There are already provisions in place to ensure that that cannot happen. I would think from a quick reading of Senator Murray's amendment that this provision is entirely unenforceable anyway. The best protection that we have is that the secretaries of those two departments are required to sign off in their own names on these reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I just think we already have a sensible provision within the legislation that deals with this problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now turn to Australian Democrat amendment No. 8 on sheet 664 revised. This relates to the costing of election commitments.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8131"> 29(2). That is on page 2 of the schedule. At subclause (2) insert at the beginning of the subclause `subject to clause 31, subclause (4)'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this minor amendment is to clearly link the costing of election commitments in clause 29 with the provision for supplementary policy costings in subclause 31(4) after the policy costings have been completed under section 29 as long as those supplementary policy costings are provided seven days prior to the election date. The reason for this specification that policies be provided to the department 21 days before and supplementary ones not less than seven days before is to ensure that Treasury and finance departments have sufficient time to cost supplementary policies. It is also designed to ensure that the electorate is informed as far as is possible of policies days before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments apply during only the caretaker period following the issuing of a writ for an election. The intention of this amendment is to provide for the costing of election commitments of both major parties. I wish it was minor parties as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costing of election commitments will clearly assist the electorates in their assessment of the parties' fiscal policies and their election promises. It will encourage parties to ensure that the election commitments are economically responsible and not unnecessarily burdensome on the public purse. The amendment will make available to the government, the opposition and all those concerned within those parties the resources of the departments of Treasury and Finance during the caretaker period to cost election commitments so that the public may be made fully aware of the fiscal impacts of such commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this amendment serves again to enhance the intention of the bill by improving the information which the electorate have at their disposal in the election of the government to come.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on the record one of a number of concerns that many Australians&mdash;certainly those who would like to see a full range of policy commitments released&mdash;would have. I heard Senator Margetts speaking before the suspension of the sitting for dinner about the trick that the coalition played in terms of our policy announcements&mdash;releasing them in quick fire succession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy of the coalition was to release all of our policies before the election. Our strategy included releasing, on average, one policy a day for the period of the election. I know from my own experience in the portfolio that I had responsibility for prior to the election that I worked very hard to ensure that as many people as possible knew what was in the policy. The problem was not so much trying to hide the policy from people. We went to enormous lengths to ensure that people were very well aware of the policies. It is very hard, as all politicians would know, to get more than the core details of the core parts of policy across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You certainly do get more attention paid to policies in an election environment. If I were to release my sports policy three months out from an election and try to get someone to focus on it, it would be almost impossible. At least in an election climate, people are interested in what the parties are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, for example, who is with us in the chamber tonight, released, as you will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8133"> recall, Senator Margetts, an environment policy. That was one of the most detailed environment policies ever prepared by a major party in Australia's history; at least that is what Senator Kemp told me. It is fair to say that that policy received a lot more attention in the context of the election campaign&mdash;the detail of it as well&mdash;because it was released in that campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern I am leading to is that, with the get out of some sorts of exemptions, you effectively would have to have the policies finalised and released within 12 days of the firing of the starter's gun and the issue of the writs. I think we had something like 38 policies during the last election. It was a fairly neat fit to try to do about one a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are saying is that you have to get all of your policies out in the first 10 days. You probably argue that we should put the policies out well before the election. My own long experience in this area shows that you do not get the coverage. You do want people's minds to be focused. When you release a sports policy or a policy on the environment or whatever, not only do you get the information out through the electronic media, the newspapers and so forth and you send it to all the interest groups in the mail, but you always get telephone calls into the office, the Liberal Party campaign offices or electorate offices and you can send out detailed material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, when Senator Kemp released that environment policy I was meeting with Senator Chamarette, your former colleague. She was very interested and requested a copy which I duly delivered to her that afternoon. I know that Senator Chamarette would have gone through that policy in some detail. That is a normal sort of process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment, on my reading of it and on the advice I have taken on it, with one or two exemptions effectively means you cannot release any detailed policies for the final 21 days of the campaign&mdash;and I would have thought that is quite counter to democratic principles. I would have thought that political parties should be releasing policies throughout that 33&hyphen;day campaign period and allowing the voters, at a time when they are most focused 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on political matters, to assess those policies and to do so in comparison with the alternatives in the political battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The imposition that this would place on the Treasury and Finance officials is almost too hard to imagine. I would be interested to see, when Senator Cook has had a chance to top and tail the amendments with the proposed amendment, the addition of 31(4), what the opposition's views are. They have had the benefit of being in government and knowing what would be required, practically speaking, to achieve the implementation of this amendment. I put it to the Senate that it will be a very important test of the opposition's sincerity in dealing with this legislation because on my reading of it it would probably be quite counterproductive to the very essence and aim of this bill, which is to place the fiscal footing of the government and any policy proposals before the people in an objective and democratic way. But I wait with bated breath to hear what Senator Cook has to say about this proposal. It will be a test of their sincerity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How could I refuse such a generous invitation to test my sincerity? But let me start where I would like to start, if I may. As I said before, there are some things in this amendment that I approve of and agree with. One is the question of minor parties being able to have their policies costed. I voted for such an amendment earlier. That amendment has been put and defeated in this chamber and is back here in this proposal&mdash;and I would be happy to vote for it again. I am also pleased that in the first part, subclause (1), the option of the Prime Minister to refer or not refer opposition policies for costing is removed because the wording of this paragraph means that the Leader of the Opposition's policies are referred. So the intervention of the Prime Minister in deciding what goes for costing and what does not in opposition policy is removed; and that is a very positive thing. When we moved that amendment before we lost it. It is back here now and we have a chance to restore it. I would like to be able to succeed in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to balance those positive things against, in the first clause, the seven&hyphen;day rule. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8134"> We have not had the chance to consider this properly but it may be just a touch too rigid for us. Looking down the list further, to subclause (5), there is a penalty of 20 penalty units imposed for a breach of subclause (5). The subclause states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary, or a person selected . . . must not disclose the contents of a policy document to another person without the permission of the office holder providing the policy document until the policy document is publicly released.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If they do, there is a penalty. I understand why that is there. I again make the observation that we sought that this bill, if it were to become an act, be enforceable. That was defeated. It is not enforceable so I do not know how we can have in a bill a penalty which, if the bill were to become an act, would not be enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at this amendment, I am driven to the conclusion, reluctantly and to some extent against my will, that I am proposing to vote against it in favour of pursuing the amendments that are circulated in my name and which deal with some of these things on an individual basis rather than within a block amendment of this nature. That is not, as I have said, that I do not have strong sympathy with the question of the Prime Minister not interfering and being able to decide what is referred and what is not. I am happy to have minor parties have their programs costed. But there are other elements to this fuller clause that create in me a bit of anxiety and cause me to want to act cautiously and pursue my amendments individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not directed my attention in a great deal of detail to subclause (4) of clause 31 in amendment No. 12, the one that has been moved concurrently with the amendment before the chair and on which I am asked to test my bona fides in this chamber. I will do so but for the moment all I can say is that I am disposed at this stage and for the reasons I have enunciated not to support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook, I am not one of those who would ever question your bona fides in this chamber. I have always found you to be very straightforward. Having said 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, there are two points I want to pick up on. The minister goes to a question of emphasis and philosophy. The one view we have is that the government, the opposition and anyone who is serious about the election process will have developed their policies well in advance of any election. Not to do so would frankly be delinquency of the highest order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue is when those policies are released, not whether they are prepared or ready to go, and whether the electorate have sufficient time in which to consider those policies. Our view has always been that the earlier policies of detail and depth are released the more serious and the more considered a view the electorate can take at large. It is extremely difficult for the media, other political parties and especially the electorate to view in a few short days a welter of policies which descend on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, you referred to the question of penalty. You are right that, as the bill as a whole is unenforceable, it makes it difficult to enforce that particular clause. But I would suggest that one of the most important things to any political party is that it controls the timing and the contents of the release of its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the administration in recent years has taken to leaking like a sieve, you need to be able to control this sort of area. It will be a problem that faces the government and the opposition more than it faces those on the crossbenches. With those few remarks, I will leave my amendments to your views.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Prime Minister may request the responsible Secretaries to prepare costings of publicly announced Government policies . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will be moving an amendment later which deals with the term `publicly announced'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to explain it in any detail now, but essentially we think there is considerable virtue&mdash;in fact, it would improve this bill considerably&mdash;in giving some indication of policy costings prior to announcement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8135"> and how the Treasury would go about costing particular policy initiatives. So my amendment to be moved later would enable an opposition or a government to approach Treasury with costings of their policies. Once they have those costings, they may wish to change the policies to reduce the cost or to add to the cost accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, for subclause 29(1)(b), you may wish to move the following words, which would overcome my anxiety. Next to `the Leader of the Opposition', you might insert `and any minor party leaders' and chop out `subject to subclause (4)'. After `request the responsible secretaries to prepare costings of', chop out `publicly announced opposition policies'. That should be `opposition and minor party policies'. That would overcome my problem with this block amendment that you have moved and would enable me to deal with this question, which is now being brought into this discussion, of `publicly announced'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With `publicly announced' we are embarking on something quite new. There will not be any appeals after this process. You are in an election context; you submit your policies; they are costed and, bang, that is it. You live or die by those costings once they are published. To us in the opposition, the process of government is about looking at alternative costings for various policy options, selecting the appropriate policy option and going with that. That is what cabinets do. They have documents before them often setting out three or four proposals and they know what the variations of costs are. Governments have that advantage. So they can balance the policy objective against the cost and make a considered decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oppositions will only be able to lodge their papers and have them costed and they will be stuck with that cost. If they knew what the cost was, the structure of the policy might have been a little different. It seems to us that that biases the fairness of this in favour of he or she who commands the greatest resources in the election context. That is why we are a bit leery about the publicly announced policies. Quite clearly, with policies that you might want to put, you do not want to be shot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down once the costings are revealed; you want to be sensitive to those questions. That is why I have those amendments up my sleeve for a little later on down the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to do is get a signal from Senator Murray as to how that sits with him and whether the changes in the words in (b) to include `and any minor party leaders' along with `the Leader of the Opposition' would go to meeting his principle points. If it did, it would meet my anxieties as well. I apologise to the other minor party and the Independent here.

Is it wanting to achieve a clear understanding for the electors of what is going to be the bottom line of a government and alternative government running for the next however many years&mdash;three years? Is that what we are about? I really do not know what all this is about, unless you are looking to a situation whereby the public will be able to receive professional advice from the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to the Department of Finance as to what is the bottom line.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say `minor parties'. Okay, we will do away with the navy. What is that going to cost or save?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry, but one other thing that has been niggling the back of my mind is whether this is going to politicise the Public Service. I know that we have some full and frank discussions with public servants when they come before the estimates committees. They are quite helpful with the information that they give, but very often you can see that government departments have got certain policies which are not necessarily the policies of the particular government. I am saying that, from my experience over the last 21 or 22 years in this place, you do get government departments with a policy which may be in conflict with the government's policy&mdash;there is no doubt about that. It might not be overtly in conflict, but it is the general culture of that particular department. With this whole measure, are we likely to politicise the Public Service?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just make a couple of observations. I thought Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Harradine made some interesting comments. Let me make my first point: this traverses the ground which the Senate has already rejected regarding minor parties. The Senate has already voted on that issue. Senator Harradine expressed it rather well: we are looking at the policies of the government and the alternative government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We rejected the minor parties issue for the very good reason of the enormous amount of work and pressure that this would place on the Public Service. I have no doubt that Senator Bob Brown and Senator Margetts would produce comprehensive and extensive policies&mdash;one can judge this by their contributions in this chamber&mdash;which may well require greater costings from the Public Service than those of the alternative government. This is taking this bill down the track which this debate has already rejected. We have already had that vote on the minor parties and now it is being brought back in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which does not seem to be understood is that the costing of policies is not compulsory. There would be quite a few policies in respect of which the costings would be largely agreed or else they would be minor and therefore of no great consequence. So we are not instructing people that they have to have their policies for costing. The reality is there will be some major ticket items and that may well form the substance of debate. Therefore the Leader of the Opposition, if he so wishes, can ask the Prime Minister to have that policy costed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is quite contrary to, one, what the Senate has already determined and, two, the general philosophy of this bill. We are having rules about whether things can be costed or not, and we are having seven&hyphen;day rules; it is just incomprehensible that this could be workable. I understand that the minor parties wish to take part in this process&mdash;and good on them&mdash;but we are going to put huge pressure on the Public Service in the midst of this debate. As for the amount of work that minor parties require, how is `minor party' defined? Is a minor party someone who is already a member of the chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, this amendment probably goes far wider than the amendment that was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8137"> already comprehensively rejected by the committee. I would have to say that we think it is unworkable. This bill allows the costing of individual policies. These are typically the big ticket items and in that case, Senator Harradine, the public will have a pretty good idea of the bottom line. That is the process by which this is delivered. There may well be major policy initiatives in which the government and the opposition are broadly agreed on the costings and therefore there is simply no need for them to be presented to the department for costing. There may well be an issue where policies come up during the election and on which political parties put forward views&mdash;these are issues which emerge from the public debate. This amendment is incredibly prescriptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it is trying to get through the back door something which was already rejected by this Senate. Secondly, it does recognise the nature of what this is about, which is simply to allow policies to be costed. If the Leader of the Opposition, for example, believes that he is being unfairly criticised and the policies he is putting forward are soundly costed, he can get that tested if he so wishes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised two key points: whether minor parties should have their policies costed and whether we are politicising the Public Service. With regard to the first point, it is, at end of the day, optional for parties to submit their programs for costing. If the minor parties were included, that would be an option for them. Secondly, this amendment is moved by a minor party, therefore I detect an interest in having their policies costed. In the broad sweep of this I am happy to oblige by voting for that idea. Thirdly, I think there would be some benefit&mdash;and I say this in a way that is detrimental to the Democrats&mdash;in the sense that their policies could be put through a rigorous cost filter, because it might make some difference to the policies. But that is a political point that I would make in my debate with the Democrats. Those are the only points I would make about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of whether we are politicising the Public Service, the answer to that is probably `no'. You are right to say that, frequently, departments have their own agendas and when ministers change the same old

But what you have here is the Public Service performing a public duty by costing party policies. How subjectively would they go about that? I think there is a high level of professionalism. It might be in the Public Service, in some cases, that their own preconceptions about what policy should be get in the way of that but, by and large, I would answer `no' to the question of politicising the Public Service.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments involve minor rewriting of the proposed costings regime in the current bill, but in the opposition's view involve some very key and fundamental aspects of the costing regime proposal. Part 8 contains the proposed costing regime; clause 29 is the major clause in part 8, which sets the ground rules for the costing of election commitments after an election has been called. As I will explain, the government has been very cunning in framing these provisions. They are pretending that they are improving access to the costing resource of the bureaucracy&mdash;namely, the economic departments&mdash;when in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact they are proposing to create a nightmare for the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the bill currently stands, only publicly announced policies can be costed; that is, an opposition has to formally announce a policy before it is entitled to get a cost estimate from the bureaucracy. It may well be that the official costing indicates that the financial impact of the policy is significantly different from that assumed by the opposition. As such, it is not reasonable to force an opposition to publicly announce a policy about which it is unsure of the precise fiscal implications. So opposition amendments Nos 6 and 9 propose to delete the publicly announced test, which is completely unjustifiable and political in nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this legislation massively favours the government, as they have access to these economic bureaucratic resources continuously by virtue of being the government. This means the government may refine their policies or proposed policies with the assistance of costing advice from these departments without either the policies or the costs of those proposed policies having to be made public. The effect of this is to force the opposition to release publicly its policies if they want them to be costed. This is fraught with danger for the opposition, as they could be forced to announce policy decisions on the basis of incomplete information, which could expose them to political debate and ridicule. This is of no advantage to the opposition but of tremendous benefit to the government. These amendments attempt to inject some equity and fairness when it comes to policy costings. We believe that both the government and the opposition should have access to advice on costings regardless of whether the policies have been publicly announced or not. They are my remarks in support of the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this amendment is seeking to do is to turn the Treasury into a research arm of the opposition; in other words, what you are seeking to do is something which really is quite dramatic, I think, and quite contrary to the positions I believe you have always held, to maintain a Public Service which is not politicised. As I said, you will develop your policies the way we develop our policies and you will work out with your sources of advice, the way oppositions have always done, what your policy prescriptions are. You may not even wish to have them submitted for costing. In fact, many policies will simply not be submitted for costing, I suspect. It will only be those policies over which a major battle breaks out and on which the Leader of the Opposition feels that he is so sure of his costings that he will allow Treasury to cost his policies. But the Treasury is not a research arm of the opposition. The Treasury is not to develop a variety of options which you can pick and choose as you so wish.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just correct the minister on that point. Minister, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, if you read down the list of our amendments on revised sheet 362, you will come to amendment No. 13 to clause 29. The first part of it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Secretaries&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may decline to prepare costings under any request pursuant to this clause where they consider the request requires policy advice rather than merely the preparation of costings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just so that we are clear on this point, your argument was that we are wanting to use Treasury as a research arm of the opposition. That is not the case. If we were requesting from Treasury advisings which were of a policy nature, that would be the case, but we have specifically tried to guard against that by wanting, later in this debate, to move that qualifier, because we do not think that Treasury should be used as a policy research arm. We think it should be used as a costing arm. But the point that I make and the point I return to is that the costing of particular policies may well then decide in the opposition's mind what part of those policies you proceed with&mdash;all or part, or not at all. That is relevant information to have up&hyphen;front and to know when declaring what your policy position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this against a background of having sat in on the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet. I know what governments do in this sort of situation. Governments have ranges of options and they come from the bureaucracy. They are signed off by ministers and appear at the ERC. The debate that goes on at the ERC is about the policy objective and the price of it. Ministers in the ERC 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8140"> context vary the policy formations according to the price in order to get the best outcome&mdash;the best policy focus at the cheapest price. Why wouldn't they? That is their task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the advantage of government; that is the advantage of incumbency. What is new here is that the policy proposals we are putting to the public for voting on are going to be costed now, and all we are saying is that there be a chance for the opposition to submit its policies for costing&mdash;not for policy advice but for costing&mdash;before we announce them. It seems to me that that is a reasonable proposition and one in a democracy that ought to stand. Otherwise the power is with the incumbents, and the out group never gets a look in. There will be an occasion on which, with the greatest respect, the current government is the out group and will want access to this provision too. I say here, now, if this bill is carried they will be entitled to it. But we do not want you coming up later when you are in opposition wanting to amend this bill to confer on you then a right which you deny us now.

The fact of the matter is that the opposition want to put up a variety of policies, get them costed and if those costings are not what they want then they will alter their policies. That is not what the approach of this bill is at all. This bill is for oppositions and governments to develop their policies and then, if they wish, to have them costed by the Treasury. The effect of what you say confirms my view that you are seeking a process which will assist oppositions to develop policies&mdash;fine, in itself&mdash;but seeking to involve Treasury in that process. Look at the battle which may well break out. The amendment says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you seem to say that this gives government massive advantages. This bill is a major restriction on government. It is a charter of budget honesty to deal with the problems that emerged at the end of the last election when the Keating government hid the full facts of the fiscal position from the Australian public. This bill is a restriction, in that sense, on the powers of government. It is not conferring massive advantages on government. If it was such a massive advantage&mdash;no government was further from this bill than the government of which you were a member. The last thing that you wanted was a full exposure of the fiscal position of the government of Australia before the election. On the Monday after the election it was available to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but you were not prepared to share that information with the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill acts to restrict governments. This bill seeks to make governments, among other things, up&hyphen;front with the key information. You talk about conferring great advantages on government. That is not the case at all. If it was the case, your government would have grabbed it with both hands but your government could not have been further away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator, we oppose these amendments. They will lead to the politicisation of the Public Service and they will lead to the involvement of the Treasury in the preparation of policies for the opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advantage, Senator, that you and Senator Cook are purporting that we have is that this bill forces transparency on governments. This bill does not confer advantages on government; it confers advantages on the public by making sure that, among other things, the fiscal position is understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, let me tell you, that if this bill had been in operation before the last election one of two things would have happened. The first thing is that we would have known at the start of the election what the fiscal position of the country was, and I would suggest to you that the task of the Keating government would have been even more difficult; or, more likely, knowing that this bill had been enacted, the Keating government would have put in place policies to ensure that the fiscal position was not as bad as it was, so, therefore, it could go to the people with greater transparency. That is one of the great pressures that this bill brings in&mdash;the arrogance of governments in the past will no longer occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get this absolutely clear: it is not an advantage to government; it is an advantage to the public and it is a restraint on government. The argument which has been run in the last 10 minutes that with this there are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> huge advantages to government just misses the history of all this. If this were conferring huge advantages on government, this bill would have come in decades ago. The truth of the matter is that it does not confer huge advantages on government; it confers advantages on the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us think of the process that would be entailed. The reality of this is that governments and oppositions develop their publicly announced policies. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes, he can put his policy up for costing. It is not compulsory, not like the previous amendment. If he wishes, if he feels that it is to his advantage in the context of the election debate, he can put his policies up for costing. Of course, not all policies will be put up. In fact, it may be that, because this process exists, there may not be much need for policies to be costed. It may even produce the benign outcome that people are seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is that oppositions are required to do the work, as has always been required of oppositions in the past&mdash;and as was required by the opposition of which I was a member. We did our work, we developed our policies, we costed our policies and we then went into the election with those policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, governments also go to elections. Governments can develop policies any way they like. When they are in office they are by no means locked into the Public Service for the development of policies. Merely because you are in government you therefore naturally rely on the Public Service to produce your policies is an assumption or hypothesis which I think would be regarded as somewhat dangerous. This government seeks to respond not to the Public Service nor to other groups but to the national interest. In order to develop its policy positions, it may well involve consulting and dealing with bodies way outside of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator, I just do not accept the assumption that this is a great advantage for government. It is a great advantage for honesty, it is a great advantage for truth and it is a great advantage for the public. If it were of great advantage to government, this bill would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8142"> have been before this chamber long before now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, Senator Cook is proposing that the Leader of the Opposition be able to use Treasury to cost a wide range of policy options&mdash;not a single policy, but a wide range of policy options. The opposition would then be involving the Treasury in a policy process&mdash;a process which potentially is highly politicised and, I think, dangerous for the future of an apolitical Public Service.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party I know in the 13 years that it was in power would never have contemplated throwing out what is part of the Westminster system and an important convention in relation to contact between departmental officials and the opposition, particularly during a caretaker phase. I am flabbergasted that the Australian Labor Party would move this, but it is in line with a series of amendments they have moved to this bill which help draw me to the conclusion that they are not serious about this. They are so flippant about these matters after having deceived Australian electors for so long that, given the opportunity to bring a sensible charter of budget honesty regime into Australia, they are happy to play cheap politics and to chop it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to the five-day rule, a fiscal policy document having to be prepared in five days is just absolutely impractical. I know very well that Senator Cook and senior Labor Party figures who have been either finance ministers, as Mr Beazley was, or Treasurer, as Mr Willis was, know very well in their own hearts and from their own experience that there is no way this could be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, with this amendment they are prepared to throw out what has always been an important convention. If the Prime Minister of the day were to refuse a request by the Leader of the Opposition to have costings prepared, the Prime Minister would of course wear enormous political odium. That would be the issue of the day in the campaign. I am sure Senator Cook would not deny that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a practicality. It is important, in the coalition view at least in this chamber, to maintain that convention, to maintain the caretaker conventions, to maintain the convention that in caretaker mode contact with departmental officials is maintained through the Prime Minister. I repeat: for a Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister to refuse the Leader of the Opposition's request would become a matter of great political moment and debate which would probably dominate that period of the campaign. As all of us know, winning the campaign day by day, week by week is critical in these election periods and a Prime Minister deciding not to agree to refer a matter would of course be viewed very poorly by the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the coalition treats this seriously. In contrast to the opposition, we treat this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill  very seriously. We think it is an important improvement in transparency in government in Australia. It is something that Labor failed to bring in in 13 years. In fact, quite to the contrary, when they had the opportunity to say to the Australian people what the fiscal outlook was just prior to the last election they blatantly lied to them to the tune of $10.3 billion&mdash;a massive percentage of the national economy and particularly Commonwealth spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, watching the Labor Party chop this bill to pieces with silly and impractical amendments is really analogous to seeing Christopher Skase try to rewrite the bankruptcy laws and/or the extradition laws. That is analogous to seeing the Labor Party play with this bit of legislation. They cannot come to this place with credibility on the question of budget honesty. To propose to tear up this convention again is just a reaffirmation of what they bring to this whole bill: they are not serious, not fair dinkum, but prepared to tear up centuries&hyphen;old conventions that have served the people very well and are very important conventions. The coalition will vigorously oppose these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe I am missing something here. We are dealing with opposition amendments 7 and 10. Subclause 29(2) said&mdash;I will add a couple of words if I may&mdash;that a request relating to a publicly announced policy is to be in writing and to outline fully the policy to be costed, giving relevant details, and state the purpose or intention of the policy. To some extent, that is not a huge problem because it would have been publicly

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with things that have never been associated with conventions because they are new. The charter of budget honesty is new and the proposal for non-government parties to be able to access that is new. In that sense, this particular amendment goes to the point of whether or not something new which has been added in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new bill does have to go through the Prime Minister. That is my understanding of what has been asked here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the Senate has said that the policies that can be costed do not have to be announced seems to be an impossible situation. How could you have a requirement that you have to go through the Prime Minister to get a costing approval and at the same time say that we allow you to get a non-announced policy? It seems to me that this is one where there is not necessarily a convention. There obviously has to be a mode of operation for the Treasury to allow something new, which this is, to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can hear what Senator Harradine is saying but I do not think this is necessarily a problem because we are dealing with things that have never happened before within the Australian Treasury and there has to be some means by which we can facilitate them happening. To require that the Prime Minister signs off for the opposition's costing of an unannounced policy is a ridiculous situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a couple of words. I acknowledge what Senator Harradine has said. I want to comment on his remarks and the remarks of the parliamentary secretary. There is a parliamentary convention here. The parliamentary convention is that the Prime Minister and the ministers sworn in are the ones who direct the Public Service. What this bill does though during the caretaker period when the Prime Minister and his ministers are unable to direct the Public Service is impose an obligation on the Public Service to do certain things. The method of transmitting that obligation is the Prime Minister for the sake of the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the convention is struck down in most of its effect other than its appearance by virtue of the caretaker period. When we are in an election period, the government disengages itself from the Public Service during that period. The Public Service goes off and writes up its wish lists of things for the incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direction of the Public Service during this period by the minister or the Prime Minister is not competent. They cannot direct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8148"> them to do this, that or the other. If this bill is carried, then they have the power to direct them to do things in this bill. That is new. That changes the quality and nature of the convention. The quality and nature of the convention is changed because the government wants it to be changed&mdash;this government wants it to be changed; it has introduced this bill. When we talk about the convention, we cannot talk about it in pure form because this very bill changes the nature and quality of it. That is my first point, and I think that is a very relevant point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the parliamentary secretary says that, of course, the Prime Minister will pass on the request of the Leader of the Opposition. To do so would be to create a major element of political abuse. Let me come back to that in a minute. What the parliamentary secretary is saying is that the Prime Minister will obey an unspoken intent here that he should pass on honestly to the Public Service the full content of the Leader of the Opposition's policies. There is recognition of the fact that, of course, he will but maybe there will be an argument that maybe he will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment would put the Prime Minister above that. If the parliamentary secretary is right, and I hope he is, for all prime ministers henceforth, whoever they might be, justice would be done. But with my amendment justice would also be seen to be done. This distracting debate in public during an election campaign, about whether or not all the policies have been passed on in the manner that they have been submitted or whether something has been lost in the translation, would not occur with this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By carrying this amendment we remove from the election campaign that type of public debate which could potentially clog up the ability of the electorate to come to a very clear and focused understanding of what is involved. The `be seen to be done' part is as important as being done. If the parliamentary secretary is right, it will be so for this Prime Minister and all the prime ministers yet to be elected for as long as this bill, if it becomes an act, remains an act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I make is that we are not having a discussion here. This subclause requires it to be written so there is not contact between the opposition and the Public Service. There is a written document that is transmitted. That, I think, may assuage some of the concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the point that, yes, there is a convention. This bill changes the nature of that convention by imposing new obligations on the Public Service during the period of caretakership, when the convention is the Prime Minister and the ministers cannot direct the Public Service. The very quality of the convention being defended at the parliamentary table by the secretary is changed. Let's get the debate simple and keep it focused. Let's remove the argument as to whether or not the Prime Minister has done the right thing or whether the Prime Minister has somehow, in the transmission of the request, mangled the policy details.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be&mdash;I am not wanting to construct fanciful scenarios&mdash;that the opposition's request gets delayed on the in&hyphen;tray while we go and deal with a national calamity. Or it could be not that the full request is not passed on but it is passed on more slowly or for whatever other reasons. The thing that attracts me to this outcome, in view of the loss of my earlier amendment, is that there is a possibility that there is no discretion on behalf of the Prime Minister. So the argument about whether or not the full policy details of the opposition were passed on does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill strikes me as being to try to simplify the issues and provide greater transparency for the public to discriminate with their vote over the economic implications of policy. As it stands, there is a possibility of a red herring being drawn across the path. They happen in election campaigns all the time. If this is about simplicity and transparency, then I think there is a real case to look at the automatic transmission that has been referred to by Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one wants to be exhaustive about it, there is not just the question of the conduct of the Prime Minister; documents can get lost, be misplaced or there can be other problems within the office. At the end of the day the Prime Minister has to take responsibility for that because it is his office. Therefore it is an extension of him. Just to get this issue out of the debate I think would be a very good thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of this committee was a most difficult one because it was clearly done in a highly charged political atmosphere in which the Labor Party, as I have indicated earlier, had indicated where they were coming from before the first word of evidence had been given to the committee. As a result, resources were made available for them to be able to write a separate and dissenting report. It is interesting to note, having spoken at a number of functions along with the honourable member for Banks, Mr Melham, the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the sort of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite inflammatory language that was employed on those occasions in relation to the government's 10&hyphen;point plan and its proposed legislation to deal with those 10 points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, for example, that during some of the hearings the suggestion of allowing pastoralists to engage in farm tourism was seen as being quite outrageous. In their report, guess what they suggest: that we adopt the definition as contained in the Northern Territory legislation for pastoral leases and what they are able to do. Do you know what that includes? Farm tourism. So, having inflamed the public's mind in relation to a number of issues, when actually confronted with what would have to be done they then realised that some of their alleged concerns had to be put aside and that they would have to agree with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also engaged in what could only be described as a dramatic rewrite of history; revisionism at its best. We are told, for example, in their executive summary that the government of the day and the Australian Democrats drafted the legislation&mdash;this is referring to the Native Title Act 1993&mdash;in open and direct consultation with all the stakeholders. That clearly was not the case. Indeed, Senator Barney Cooney chaired the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which dealt with the question of the Native Title Act back in 1993, and do you know what it found? It found that a number of Aborigines themselves, groups and individuals, complained to the committee that a deal was done with the then Prime Minister and that they were not part of it; it was a secret deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk to pastoralists like Mr Rick Farley from the National Farmers Federation, I do not think that he would believe, nor would the National Farmers Federation these days, that they were in fact taken in and consulted to the extent that the Labor Party would now have us believe. The question then is, what about the mining industry? Were they part of those consultations? Were the state governments part of those consultations? Were local government part of those consultations? Indeed, was the opposition, the alterna 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8154"> tive government, part of those consultations? Of course, the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all this time discussing this issue of the 10&hyphen;point plan, the Labor Party in their minority recommendations tell us this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations set out below are not exhaustive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor Party still have not got their house in order on this important social issue. They still have not been able to get it together. How long do they need to be able to get their house in order in relation to this important policy issue? They did have the benefit of some extra advice, which I must say is really an acknowledgment by the Labor Party that they were not sufficiently skilled to write their own dissenting report, that they needed that extra professional help paid for by the taxpayers. I must say that all the dissenting reports I have been part of have been penned either by me or fellow senators from this side; they have not been courtesy of an extra bucket load of money from the taxpayers to assist in that regard. But you would have thought, with that extra help just to push them along a bit, they might have been able to come down with a firm policy position. But, no, they have not been able to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want tonight to draw the attention of the Senate to a speech I was able to give in India recently. I was asked if I would care to give a keynote speech at a women and governance conference in Delhi to celebrate 50 years of Indian independence. I must say I was very honoured to have the privilege of being able to do that. I had visited Delhi late last year and met with a number of the women's organisations in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> India, particularly in and around Delhi. One such group was the Women's Political Watch, headed by a wonderful woman called Veena Nayyar. I was delighted when she wrote and asked me if I would care to come to Delhi in September to contribute to this conference. There were representatives at this conference from all around the world. Some 250 or 300 delegates were there. I must say it was a most successful conference indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It comes at a very good time in India, because they have before their parliament a bill to reserve 33&frac13; per cent of their federal parliamentary places for women. In the lead&hyphen;up to the last election all different parties agreed to this proposal as part of their platform, but they had not reckoned with the political ability of many of the women in India, who have seen this piece of legislation actually brought into the parliament, from where it was referred off to a committee&mdash;a fairly standard deferral procedure. Subsequently it has come back into the Indian parliament. I might stand corrected on some of these actual procedures through the parliament because their ways of dealing with matters are somewhat different from our parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened now is that the gentlemen in the parliament in India are of the view that of course we all agree in principle with this point, but let us talk about the actual figure: `What support is there for 20 per cent? Do we hear any votes for 15 per cent?' So in fact what they are doing is bargaining down the 33&frac13; per cent. My comment on that is that they should know that this is a parliament and not a bazaar when it comes to voting for the 33&frac13; per cent reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will continue to watch closely the outcome of this piece of legislation in the Indian parliament. I might say that at the more regional and local government level they have had reservations in place for 50 years for different groups of people, in particular untouchables and what are known as OBCs, other backward castes, and indeed women. Some 800,000 women at the local level have been able to take public office because of a reservations bill for local government, and some 75,000 Indian women have taken the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8155"> role of chair in a number of those local organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is certainly true that, given the opportunity to participate, to be represented and to represent a different voice, women have been more than able to rise to that occasion in India. When I visited Delhi last year I met with Madam Heptulla and a number of women from the different parties in the Indian parliament. All the women from all the different parties in the Indian parliament are united absolutely in their support for increased representation of women in the parliament. So it will be very interesting to see how that bill goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also very interesting to point out that in the Australian parliament such a process would never, ever occur. No incumbent Liberal government would make a bill to reserve places that would set requirements for the opposition Labor Party and no Labor Party in government would likewise make a bill that would reserve and make requirements on an opposition party. I pointed out that our way of doing it in Australia is different&mdash;it is through our parties. In my own party, the Labor Party, it is done through a rule change that now requires that by the year 2002 at least 35 per cent of safe seats shall be occupied by women.</PARA>

Following the very recent election in South Australia, my own state, 10 out of 21 of the Legislative Assembly Labor Party members are women. That is the highest percentage of women in any parliament anywhere at any time. So it is quite clearly a process that is well under way within the Labor Party and, as I said in my speech, Senator, well under way within the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party was very successful at the last election. Senator Newman insists that it was all done without affirmative action. I like the way Senator Newman, for example, says, `Well, we had no affirmative action. It is just that the Liberal Party advertised widely to invite women to come forward as possible candidates.' They were also assisted with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meetings to teach them how to dress and speak publicly, how the process operates and so on&mdash;by any definition an affirmative action program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also pointed out to the women in India that, while I have acknowledged on the public record many times my congratulations to the Liberal Party for its success in achieving an increased number of women at the last election, every day across this chamber I argue and fight with those women as they all vote for the systematic dismantling of all the programs and processes that we put in place to assist women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I drew some references from Marilyn Waring's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Three Masquerades</EMPHASIS>. In her first chapter about the difficulties she experienced being a woman in the New Zealand parliament she said that it was very tough and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8156"> that there were lots of very lonely and difficult times for those women who were breaking new ground in parliament. In some ways I think that she describes a piece of history that is largely gone. Certainly the point that I wanted to make in India was that the women coming into Australian parliamentarians now are not the first. Madam President, you and I and others have broken the first ground, as have some before us. Our generation in particular has made it perfectly clear that women can come into this parliament and cope very well&mdash;excellently, in fact. Indeed the electorate have made it very clear that they are very happy to support women across the political spectrum. They are a very attractive addition in the electorate. People like what women represent and how women are able to listen to what the electorate has to say and bring different things into the political agenda in this place&mdash;different emphases and points are debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was at a conference in New York on governance all of the countries present at that conference argued very strongly the importance of democracy and the move by many nations towards democracy. One critical part of that is the representation element of it. If you are serious about representation in democracy then you have to move to 50 per cent of women in our parliaments. Indeed, that ought be the goal, and indeed that will happen. All it will take, as I said in my speech, is `time and our daughters'. Indeed, our daughters will come into the parliaments knowing that they will be welcomed by us. They will certainly be welcomed by me, but I think that most of us in this parliament would welcome the younger generation of women, along with men&mdash;standing side by side, 50 per cent of each, I hope, in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are some of the points I made. I have not gone through all of them. I was able to tell some stories about our parliament, particularly one about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;it is a record I remember very well. When I came into parliament I had learnt from Gough Whitlam the habit of reading the daily <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and I noted that no matter how many of us used non&hyphen;sexist language Hansard used to edit it to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the male third person. It was not until we stood in this place and asked Mr President to look at that that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> changed and finally became a record of what was actually said in our parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much to say about women and their role in India. Let me limit it to two comments. India has provided one of the first women Prime Ministers, Indira Gandhi. Many Indian women are known world wide as strong and brave and clever and able. On the other side of the coin, thousands of Indian women live in poverty, they are not literate and they work very hard all their short lives to provide subsistence, food, clothing and housing for their families.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to begin by telling you about an Indian Gentleman I met here in December last year. He asked me, "what I thought was the greatest achievement of the 20th Century." I thought for a while and answered that perhaps the technological advancements of international communications. He replied that he thought it was the improved Status of Women. Initially I was surprised, albeit pleased at his answer, but the more I have thought about it, the more I have come to utterly agree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations declared 1975-1985 the Women's decade. "International Women's Year" marked the beginning of the worldwide awareness of the social, political, economic and cultural concerns of women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have come a long way in the heightened awareness of the wide range of problems that women encounter in their daily lives. There is not a country in the world that has gone untouched by the emergence of `women's issues'. Laws, political systems, and economic and cultural institutions have been changed everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">100 years ago very few women in the world had the right to vote, the right to property and the right to an education; to learn to read or write, to go to university, the right to protection and safety from violence at home or in society, the right to have a say, the right to health care or reasonable housing. While most women worked, it was in unpaid work and low paid work in poor conditions. A century on, things have certainly changed. Women around the world now have the right to vote, to have property and money of their own, to attend university, to go to school, to read and write, to have reasonable health care and housing. Laws protect them against violence in the home and in the street and some of them are paid equally to men for their work.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BUT. . . . . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recently attended a conference in New York, sponsored by UNDP, looking at governance and women's participation.

While no delegate was fool enough&mdash;or brave enough&mdash;to oppose the idea, there were reservations. These were best summarised by one country proposing that we should proceed with caution because "women were their own worst enemy". Fortunately and admirably, indeed succinctly an Australian colleague, Barry Jones MP said in response: "Not while men are alive!"</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Labor Government was elected in 1983, it came into office with a platform that included a document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards Equality. </EMPHASIS> That document spelled out 42 proposals to advance the position of Women in Australian society. It included sex discrimination legislation, affirmative action proposals, child care, women's health programs, equal employment opportunity programs, anti domestic violence campaigns, educational programs for girls into non-traditional areas like maths and science, mature aged entry into university, equal pay provisions, and women and sport programs, to name a few. It also listed a women's perspective in non-specific to women areas like superannuation and medicare&mdash;our national health program, industry policy and family friendly work place reforms. The policy document also stressed the importance of establishing government mechanisms to defend and extend women's participation and protection. The Office of the Status of Women was brought in/elevated to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Women's desks were established in a number of departments. There was to be a Women's Budget Paper released each year with the government budget. That document was an account of how every department's spending was directed to needs of women. A Women's Agenda was formulated and published and an expanded National Women's Advisory Body was established. National Women's Peak Organisations received government funding and elected women representatives to advise government on further improvements for women.</PARA>

Our Sex Discrimination Act prohibited discrimination on grounds of sex, marriage and sexual preference in housing, finance and employment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Things we thought were set in stone, things women have worked and struggled for over very many years, have in 18 months of the new government, disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many child care centres have closed and child care fees have increased by $20 or more per week, per child; equity funding for education has largely been removed; the women's health program is being rolled into one public health program and its funding cut by 10%; the affirmative action agency no longer requires businesses and universities to report annually of their advancements for women; legal aid money, so important for women, has been dramatically reduced, the cost of court appearances has been significantly increased; up-front fees for post graduate study have been introduced, significantly impacting on women. The commitment to equal pay has been removed from the Industrial Relations Legislation; the Office of the Status of Women has had its funding savagely cut by 40%, we have retained the Sex Discrimination Commissioner in our Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission only after a public brawl and profound lobbying;. . . and the Women's Budget no longer is produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just when other countries, e.g. South Africa, are proposing to copy Australia and introduce their own Women's Budget our Women's Budget is removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Australian government presented its report on its Gender Equity Policy to the UN Committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in July this year, the UN Committee made the following comments: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8159">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee was alarmed by policy changes that apparently slowed or reversed, Australia's progress in achieving equality between women and men, such as in housing and child-care programmes and in employment assistance". The Age PA6;29.7.97</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason I have spent some time spelling out Australia's changes for you is because at the last election, the successful liberal coalition Government saw elected a record number of women in the ranks. 19 liberal coalition women have come into the House of Representatives in Parliament and have voted for the systematic winding back of gains for women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Back to my earlier points on fair representation. What Australia teaches us is that support for more women into parliament means just that and no more: That is, it is a step in the right direction for fair representation but it is no guarantee of improvement of conditions for women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That struggle is a political one, determined in Australia's case, by party politics and programs, not merely by more women in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the women elected in 1996, Pauline Hanson, has led a virulent and misinformed campaign against Aboriginal Australians and Asian migrants. She has challenged Australia's multi cultural and tolerant attitude. Again I find it ironic that I support women in parliament but I totally oppose what this woman says. However, men of every persuasion have long since been elected to our parliaments, the same must be true for women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make it clear&mdash;I support the increased number of liberal women and I congratulate them. Now, every day, I argue, debate and criticise them and their policies across the Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On very few things are the women in our parliament united. Sometimes there is support below the counter, so to speak, but the public face is partly political differences, rather than unity of purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Labor party has argued for women to have more choice, more opportunities, to participate in the work force with government funded child care and support, the Liberal Coalition has encouraged more women to leave the work force to return to the home as their principal occupation, and to provide care for children and the aged, with only modest government support. It is much more an emphasis on individuals doing for themselves than counting on partnership with government to assist them in their choices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I take some support from a woman who when interviewed in 1995 about changes by the Labor government said: "Things are still tough for me and my family but they are much better for me than they were for my mother and my grandmother. I don't want to go back to their ways&mdash;to their world."  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where does all this lead? Firstly, it illustrates the importance of government for women&mdash;their advancement and the importance of electing to our Parliament, women who are committed to the improvement of conditions for women. That is why the Labor women have campaigned for and succeeded in changing our party rules about the selection of women as candidates for election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our rule change requires that at least 35% of safe seats must be provided for women and for men&mdash;to be achieved by 2002. I can assure you that it has been a hard fought battle and it is grudging in it's implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women will continue to be elected and pre-selected, because what each party now knows is that women are an electoral asset. The community welcomes us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, as a Liberal women said to me recently: "the Labor Party's successful rule change has been of great benefit to Liberal women". To which I replied: And your success at the last election has been of great benefit for Labor women!"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, it is very hard to be elected to Parliament as an Independent. Most success comes through the two major parties&mdash;Labor and the Liberal-National Coalition. Democrats have been successful in the Senate only&mdash;our upper house, elected on proportional representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have talked about Australia because I know it first hand. I know we have problems and there are real challenges for our government. But we do not face challenges of the magnitude of India or many other countries. Those challenges include a population growth that "adds the population of Australia every year", as one person put it to me. And I know that many women cannot read and write, indeed may not even get schooling, that girl babies are not loved and valued as boy babies, that young girls are sold into the sex trade and that many mothers have no access to, or option for, contraception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing this conference illustrates is how women can come together to support each other and to learn from each other, and it provides an opportunity for me to say, and I'm sure I speak for you all, that we are united as women around the world, to see justice for women and girls in every country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to turn now to a different perspective. The role of government has never been more important, I believe, than at this time of international businesses, international finance and world wide information technology. When multi-national companies can pick up their businesses and accompanying jobs and move them to another country where labour costs are much less, how can government operate to protect employment and the wealth of the nation from the loss of those jobs and investment? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8160">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can government cope with foreign investment if much of the financial returns are repatriated to the country of the head offices?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can governments collect adequate taxes if more and more money and retail transactions are effected through the Internet where no taxes are paid and it is not possible to trace such transactions?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can, governments cope with new information technology when as President Clinton said in an address to the Australian House of Reps on his recent visit:- let us not forget that over 60% of the people in the world are two days walk from the nearest telephone?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said earlier that government, especially democratic government was the voice, the protector and the advocate of the people. Given the questions, I've just posed, it becomes clear that not only do we need representative government, we need cooperation and collaboration between governments to tackle international challenges. If we didn't have a UN, we'd have to invent one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, here again, the UN needs to shift and shape to present circumstances. Its international peace keeping role is a step in the right direction, but we need the same international commitment and involvement in the social and trade functions of the world's governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we judge that women's perspective is vital at government level, and I do, equally we need women's participation and perspective at the International&mdash;the UN&mdash;level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And further, we need women's presence, participation and perspective in international finance&mdash;the IMF, the World Bank; in national banking houses, in boards of multinational corporations, and in information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that may lead to a sense of overwhelming demand with little likelihood of success. However, we the world's women, have achieved great gains at the local and national level. We will proceed at the international too. All we need is time&mdash;and our daughters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And knowledge of things like the International Court of Justice where we can appeal the case for women's representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me back up a little.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A conference such as this is of great importance in allowing the exchange of information and different ways to achieve improvements for women and greater participation in our Parliaments. I am delighted to know about India's bill to reserve 33 1/3% of places in her national parliament for women. I have no doubt that in time you will succeed. What I like about it is that it is different from which we are doing in Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is different from what Scandinavian countries have done and it is different from what the UK Labor party has done&mdash;to reserve a percentage of seats for women candidates. That process has been ruled unfair by the courts; but the pre-selections were not recontested and so Prime Minister Tony Blair has over 100 women in his 400 plus caucus. It is still only 25% but it is a significant <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">critical mass.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the variety of ways that women are employing to achieve their increased representation in Parliament that fascinates me, as much as the successes. We must ensure that this information is widely known by women around the world. One way is via conferences and the like. Another is via the Internet and the World Wide Web. Not long ago, I visited Seoul and met there a woman who had just returned from establishing a femminet in Mongolia. She has also established the same in Korea and Malaysia. The Wcmen's Net world wide grows by the day. More and more parliaments and their women representatives are there for all to see. Other networks explain the different mechanisms by which this is being achieved. Hopefully, soon the Inter-Parliamentary Union's excellent publications about women and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associations will be equally available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such data is invaluable and increasingly accessible. I am delighted that so many women, of so many ages, but particularly young women are as at home on the web as they are at the stove and the sink. Our challenge is to ensure that all our young women can read and write and have access to computers and the Internet. Here clearly, is a role for government. And here clearly is the importance of women in parliament&mdash;to ensure that girls, as well as boys, have that schooling. I have just finished a report, as Chair of one of our Senate Committees, into Adult and Community Education. It highlights the importance of older women having access to education and computers too.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While access to the Internet is very important, so too is local access to information&mdash;within country and between country information about women. My Labor women colleagues and I have been campaigning for all Foreign Affairs briefing material about other countries to provide data about women in those countries&mdash;as well as broad acreage, exports and imports, major trade commodities and the like. Often, I still have to specifically request information about women and often still I am told "we don't have that available&mdash;it is not known".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that the Australian Post in New Delhi has very good information on the status of women in India&mdash;many of you have provided both the data and the contacts to develop and maintain it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to information about women on country publications, I recommend we ask our Foreign 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8161"> Ministers and Shadow Foreign Ministers to raise questions about women on all their country visits and to follow up on their return for reports of those discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am no longer content to accept comments like: "we had serious discussions about trade and finance, about exports and imports, about food production and regional development, about migration levels and defence&mdash;and none of these concern women". All of it is about women&mdash;they do most of the work in the food production and most of the domestic purchasing of goods and services. They have a say, mostly, in each country's population&mdash;or they should. It's time for the word women to be part of inter-country discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also think it is time for inter-country bilateral meetings of women in Parliament and government. We need lots of smaller and regional meetings in between our major UN meetings. We need the immediacy of regular and regional meetings. In such a way, the network of women in parliaments around the world can be strengthened&mdash;and we need such meetings funded and resourced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is one important reason I am happy to return to New Delhi. Australia and India have much in common and much to offer each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We play netball, hockey and cricket&mdash;women do&mdash;and we acquit ourselves well. Australia is doing nicely at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mention sport again because it is still a matter of fact that women's sports gets much less money and recognition than men's sport. This is grossly unfair and also poor judgement in Australia's case, because her women win more gold medals than her men! But still, it is very hard for Australian women to get adequate financial support. Media coverage is equally abysmal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mention this because sport is a very important contributor to the Australian culture&mdash;the very masculine mateship and competitive tough Australian. When women try for a place on the sporting field they are not only striving for equality of funding and media coverage, they are challenging and changing our very culture. Its tough. It is equally as tough in our Parliament. Changing that very masculine culture is very hard and yet very necessary. It is necessary as a matter of fairness for the women already there and it is necessary because it is a great turn off for younger women considering politics. They find it very unattractive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had some successes in changing our Parliament. When I first came into the Senate, I and my Labor colleagues used non-sexist language&mdash;men and women, he and she etc. But Hansard, which is supposed to be a record of all that is said in Parliament Usually changed it to the third person masculine. It wasn't until we raised 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this in a question to Madam President, that we got it changed. Now, what we say is actually recorded!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another time, very late at night, certain ghosts or gremlins went into our King's Hall, where portraits of past politicians hang, and they brought out from behind two pillars the only portraits of two women there. They were exchanged with portraits of prominently placed men&mdash;pun intended. Next day they were replaced and there was outrage. The following night, the same gremlins acted again. Subsequently, I asked another Question of Madam President and he decided to rotate the portraits, as a result of which the women officially got a public place/face. We have got women's toilets now but it wasn't the case for women in the early 80's. We still don't have a child care centre, though we have two very large pool rooms, hardly ever used. We are currently campaigning for a `family' room&mdash;one step at a time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also started aerobics classes with a woman colleague, and just recently I introduced Yoga classes, which I attend. Parliament is often long days and nights sitting with no chance to shop. Our parliament has a shop that sells shaving cream and razors, I organised it to have stockings and women's things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Labor caucus has a women's caucus and it has had some significant successes, particularly in questioning policies as they affect women. We have also used the caucus to promote the selection of women to senior positions in the Public Service and in private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we must see significant increases in women to boards of major companies and financial institutions. One or two women here and there is not sufficient to effect policy or culture changes in those institutions. It is the same challenge as for our Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my state of South Australia, women won the right to vote and stand for Parliament in 1894, just after New Zealand. It took 89 years for me to be elected to Federal Parliament, the first Labor woman so elected. I followed three women, two from the Liberal Party and one from the Democrats. I am the first South Australian Woman to be a Minister in the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It took a long time for the first achievements, but things are moving faster novv. And my Labor party rule change, means that I can expect more Labor women from South Australia in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Federal Parliament passed a law in 1902 giving women the vote Australia wide. However, it effectively excluded Aboriginal women and men from the vote. It was not until after the referendum in 1967 that Aboriginal people got the vote in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the 1983 election, the Labor government established a mobile unit as part of the Electoral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8162"> Commission. Its task was to go to rural and remote Australia, to teach people, particularly Aboriginal people, about voting and their rights. It is a model other countries have borrowed from us or copied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our new government has ceased all funding for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been reading Marilyn Waring's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Three Masquerades. </EMPHASIS> The first chapter is a brilliant description of the hardship and loneliness of women in Parliament to this point. I recommend it to you all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against that, I am happy to report a meeting I had with many Indian women parliamentarians, on my last visit. Hosted by Madame Heptulla, there were women from every party, united and supportive in their campaign for success with the Reservation for Women Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reading Marilyn Waring's book made me realise how all that must be done will be achieved. Her description covers the years 1970&mdash;1990 roughly the break-through years. Things are not quite the same now. Younger women coming into Parliament have us to learn from, to answer questions, to show them the ropes. They are better educated on the whole, they have grown up with a generation of young men who are much less sexist than their fathers and grandfathers. They use computers like they catch buses and trains. Its usual for so many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not the same as us&mdash;because we have made a difference! They move forward, they do not go over the same ground. They have economics degrees, they are scientists, they are doctors and lawyers and union representatives and teachers, and nurses. They climb mountains, they sail solo around the world, they run marathons. They work in many countries and speak many languages. They control their fertility and the number of babies they have. They are healthier and they will live longer. And many of them care passionately about other women and about how other women don't have it as good as them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am an incurable optimist, but even so I have a real optimism for our future. Some people can try to turn the clock back&mdash;but women who have learned to read won't stop reading. As the young woman said, "I don't want to go back to how it was for my mother and my grandmother". And they have us&mdash;to urge them on, to encourage and support them, and to celebrate with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have often been struck by how women in the community are so proud of those of us who succeed in achieving high and public office. It will be the same for our daughters, but they won't be breaking down the barriers for the first time. They will find us there to cheer them on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is when our daughters stand alongside our sons, equally represented, that our parliaments will be truly representative. Let us make it our aim for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 2020. In my former profession, medicine, that is a measure of perfect sight and a great vision for our world. We should have the same vision for politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifty years ago, Indian women and men achieved their country's independence. Fifty years on we acknowledge that great success and India's passionate commitment to democracy. In another 50 years, let us look back and see the journey to equal representation of women and men in your parliament long since completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in this adjournment debate I want to raise the issue of the coming phase-out of the analog mobile telephone system in this country. The decision to close the AMPS analog network was made by the previous Labor government, and the coalition has agreed to proceed with the phase-out of analog services by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of reasons for proceeding with the analog phase-out. The AMPS analog network is placing a technological barrier to competition, as the information superhighway rolls out across Australia and the introduction of the GSM digital technology opens up the market to three carriers. Competition in this sector has delivered lower cost calls and increased service delivery across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The licences issued to the carriers include terms requiring the closure of the analog service by the year 2000. Failure to honour these licence conditions could expose the Commonwealth to action from the carriers. Telstra, Optus and Vodafone have invested substantial sums of money in mobile digital infrastructure. They have all configured their business operations on the basis that the AMPS analog system will cease in Australia by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of the analog system has been criticised by a group called APUMP, the Association for the Protection of Users of Mobile Phones. The thrust of their criticism is that the government is ignoring the legitimate concerns of regional mobile telephone users who rely on analog services. One of the main purposes in my speaking tonight is to put to rest this rather misleading campaign 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8163"> being run by APUMP. They are suggesting that analog will disappear and that regional Australia will be left without mobile services. That is clearly untrue, and I will explain the reasons for my saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The misinformation that is being spread by APUMP could, indeed, encourage people in regional Australia to sell or trade their analog phones before actually needing to do so. The Association for the Protection of Users of Mobile Phones are making assertions about the policy that simply are not correct. Their claim that the government is ignoring the concerns of regional mobile telephone users is ill-informed nonsense. APUMP has, in a mischievous way, chosen to ignore the key elements of the government's policy on the phase-out of analog mobile services. The phase-out is planned, and it is linked to a number of safeguards&mdash;safeguards specifically designed to reduce inconvenience to mobile users, especially customers in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put on the public record the commitment given by the government and the minister, Senator Alston, in ushering in this necessary changeover. We intend to manage the upgrading of the mobile networks, being fully aware of the particular concerns of consumers in rural and regional Australia. The controlled phase-out of analog will continue to improve the service standard and competition of mobile telecommunications in this country. We intend to encourage new mobile players into the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy management approach to the upgrade is on the basis of this principle of a controlled phased changeover. In the transition period, regional and rural consumers will not lose access to analog until the digital network alternative is put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has set out a clear promise to regional consumers in recent weeks. The government will retain some AMPS analog spectrum in each existing rural planned service area, until alternative technology to deliver mobile telephony of equivalent or better quality is available. The AMPS analog spectrum will stay in those rural areas where the review of mobile services show that alternative technology will not deliver the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar service and coverage. Clearly, the minister is doing everything possible to respond to the needs of regional and rural mobile service users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with our election commitment, the government is consulting widely on the need to effect a smooth transition from analog technology to digital technology. Consumer groups have figured prominently in this policy and this consultation. These groups include the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, the Consumers Telecommunications Network, the Australian Consumers Association and the National Farmers Federation. I am quite concerned that the Association for the Protection of Mobile Phone Users is so out of step on this issue; their claims lack credibility and they are spreading misinformation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, is to be congratulated for managing this transition period to the benefit of all mobile customers. While moving to upgrade mobile telephony, regional and rural customers, and their particular concerns, are foremost in the government's mind.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8163"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Great Scott!</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The Government has announced that it would not build a spent fuel processing plant at Lucas Heights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) See response to question (10).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) The Government has not made a decision on the method of decommissioning the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights and has not, therefore, assessed the costs. This decision will be taken closer to 2005, when HIFAR is to be closed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) (a) and (b) The replacement reactor announced on 3 September will be a multi&hyphen;purpose reactor. It will continue to produce direct economic benefits in such areas as the health system and through support for the agricultural, manufacturing, mining and environmental management industries. These benefits can, to some degree, be quantified. It is conservatively estimated, for example, that the economic benefits from a research reactor amount to at least $100 million per annum for the minerals sector alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there is a national interest/public good component in the benefits to be derived from the reactor. This appears in such areas as the benefits of research, the training of scientists, technical support for the Government's nuclear policies, and the benefits to patients (as mentioned in the response to question (7)). These benefits are real, but cannot be easily quantified. The Government has taken its decision after considering both classes of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) The Research Reactor Review noted that "If HIFAR or the replacement reactor were required to balance income against expenditure solely through commercial activities, it would not be viable. This is in line with overseas experience, as no research reactors are financed solely on such a basis." This remains the case.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="8169" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education, research and innovation allow the development, transmission and application of new knowledge in the service of economic growth and employment. They help economic players to adapt and be internationally competitive in the changing world economy. In particular, scientific research provides a body of knowledge that is a foundation and source for innovative ideas, and builds skills and capabilities that also form a resource for technological innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a strong link between innovation and economic performance. Innovation involves the creation of new and improved products, services and processes which increase efficiency and market opportunities and thereby help a firm or industry to become more competitive. On a micro level, innovation is a factor in determining the cost of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8170"> production and the value of products; on a macro level, through improved economic performance, innovation leads to economic growth. Like any other economy, the Australian economy could benefit from more innovative activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data gathered from the Australian manufacturing sector illustrates the competitive advantages of innovation, and its significant role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of innovation in the manufacturing sector in 1993&hyphen;94 showed that innovative firms employ 70 per cent of employees in the sector, and account for 80 per cent of manufacturing sales and 85 per cent of manufactured exports. Information on innovation in other sectors of the economy is sparse, but based on the survey of the manufacturing sector the overall contribution of innovation to the economy is considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship between innovation and job creation is complex and indirect. However insofar as innovation stimulates economic growth it will also result in job creation. The fact that innovative firms employ a large proportion of workers in the manufacturing sector indicates that Australian innovation contributes to job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government support for scientific research and innovation in Australia is substantial, amounting to an estimated $3551 million in 1997&hyphen;98. Government programs and policies are aimed at generally lifting the quality and quantity of research and development in Australia, and its application by industry, rather than being part of a specific economic or industrial plan for the nation. For example, the Government especially recognises the need for strong communication links between publicly&hyphen;funded research bodies and the business community. These links are facilitated by initiatives such as the $145 million Cooperative Research Centre program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Factor (f) Scheme is another beneficial program. The Scheme was created to counteract the tendency of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to artificially lower prices and so discourage pharmaceutical companies from expanding their activities, in particular their investment in R&amp;D. The Scheme has been successful in boosting R&amp;D, output and exports, and in generating jobs. Its effectiveness should be further enhanced by the changes accompanying its transition to the Pharmaceuticals Industry Investment Program. However, it should be noted that the Scheme is tailored to circumstances peculiar to the pharmaceutical industry and the incentive mechanisms it relies on may not be applicable in other areas of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full range of Government science and technology programs are brought together in the Science and Technology Budget Statement, which is tabled each year in the week that the Budget is brought down. Discussion of many aspects of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government's science and technology programs can also be found in the Budget Statements. Budget Statement Number 3, for example, contains a section on the role of technological change in shaping the economy. Budget Statement Number 4 contains a section on General Research which includes coverage of scientific research. Other programs which support research are mentioned in relation to functional areas&mdash;for example health research is included in the section dealing with Health outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Science and Technology Budget Statement 1997&hyphen;98 shows that direct Commonwealth support for major science and innovation programs increased 0.8%, in real terms, between 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98. When including indirect support through the industrial R&amp;D tax concession, where there was a change in the rate which came fully into effect during 1997&hyphen;98, this gives a real decrease of 1.3% overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neglect of Australia's research and innovation base would be detrimental. For this reason the Government has a wide range of programs in place which ensure that the base is maintained and enhanced. Comparisons with OECD countries show that as a proportion of GDP Australia is fifth overall in terms of R&amp;D expenditure in universities and public sector agencies. In this situation it is hard to sustain any charge of short term economic expediency on the part of the Government. However, OECD comparisons do show that Australia's business sector has relatively low expenditure on R&amp;D, despite improvements in recent years. Arguably, the business sector overall may tend to take a short term view and give inadequate recognition to the long term benefits of innovation. For this and other reasons, the Government aims to encourage the business sector to innovate through a number of programs, notably the R&amp;D tax concession.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. At the Premier's Conference on 21 March 1997, the Prime Minister announced that the services of the Privacy Commissioner would be available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes of conduct and to meet privacy standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assisting the private sector on matters concerning the handling of personal information is a statutory function of the Privacy Commissioner. Under section 27(n) of the Privacy Act 1988 the Privacy Commissioner is to encourage corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information that are consistent with the Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data issued in 1980 by the Organisation for Economic Co&hyphen;operation and Development (the OECD Privacy Guidelines).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am advised that the Privacy Commissioner receives numerous requests from the private sector for advice and assistance. In 1995/96, for instance, more than 800 telephone requests were received from private sector organisations other than credit providers. The Privacy Commissioner's office has frequently also given written advice on the application of privacy principles and a range of materials has been developed. There have been at least 18 occasions on which the Commissioner has become involved in substantive work on codes of practice that were being either reviewed or created by an individual company or an industry body. In most cases, these codes have covered broad ethical and service delivery issues and, while making a reference to privacy, they did not aim to address all aspects of the OECD Privacy Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that since taking up duties in February 1997, and particularly since the Government's offer in March that the Privacy Commissioner would be available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes of conduct, the current Privacy Commissioner has met with companies and industry representatives on many occasions to discuss the development of appropriate practices and policies within the private sector. Since March discussions with the private sector have been focussed on seeking cooperation in the development of a consistent national framework. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8172">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 August 1997 the Privacy Commissioner released a consultation paper, Information Privacy in Australia: A National Scheme for Fair Information Practices in the Private Sector, which put forward a proposal for a self&hyphen;regulatory information privacy scheme and invited public debate on the issues raised and feedback by 15 September 1997. The Privacy Commissioner is also holding a series of forums around Australia for the full range of stakeholders to discuss the issues and to gauge the level of interest in, and commitment to, the proposed national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Discussions between the Commonwealth and the various States and Territories about extending privacy protection to the private sector are ongoing. Most recently discussions have occurred within the context of discussing a wide range of measures to advance the online economy. At the Online Council meeting on 12 September 1997 which was attended by Ministers from all levels of Australian governments, the Online Council recognised the desirability of a national approach to privacy and agreed, as a priority, to the establishment of an Online Council working party, working in conjunction with the Federal Privacy Commissioner, to develop the underlying principles of a data protection regime for the online economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally, the aim of the discussions between the Commonwealth and the various States and Territories is to reach an agreed national approach. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to outline the respective positions of the States and Territories at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) See answer to Question (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) See answer to Question (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The compliance costs of a privacy regime for the private sector would depend on the particular elements of the regime and the methods by which it was put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, there would be costs associated with:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> assessing existing record&hyphen;keeping practices and procedures against the particular information privacy standards required by the regime;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Government's decision not to legislate on private sector privacy followed extensive consultation based on the discussion paper, Privacy Protection in the Private Sector, released in September last year by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department (the Department). That discussion paper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outlined a possible approach to privacy protection in the private sector. Its purpose was to enable business and the community generally to provide concrete comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department received more than 100 submissions in response to its discussion paper, many of which provided detailed comments. As well as formal submissions, a number of organisations took the opportunity to meet with the Attorney&hyphen;General's advisers and relevant officers of the Department to discuss areas of specific concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was particular concern expressed about how a legislative regime would impact upon small and medium enterprises. Some argued strongly that there was no clear need for legislation in order to ensure privacy protection and that privacy concerns could be adequately addressed by business on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Small Business Summit in June last year recognised the cost and frustration from unnecessary or overly complex regulation which falls on small business. A specially commissioned survey, `Working Overtime' has found that, on average, small businesses spend 4 hours a week on `compliance matters'. Over the course of a year this costs the average small business $7000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges that complying with current regulatory requirements already imposes a significant burden on Australian businesses and is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on all business. In opting for an approach to encourage the adoption of voluntary codes of conduct to enhance privacy protection in the private sector, the Government aimed to identify the right balance between ensuring adequate privacy protection and advancing the competitive interests of Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) The Government has decided to support a voluntary approach to ensuring privacy protection in the private sector involving the development of voluntary codes of practice. The Privacy Commissioner has commenced consultations with the private sector on her proposal for a national self&hyphen;regulatory scheme for information privacy protection. Therefore, the Government does not agree that there will be no privacy regime applying to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were concerns expressed in some of the submissions made in response to the Department's September 1996 discussion paper about the potential impact on Australia of the European Union Directive on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data (the EU Directive).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has followed closely the development of the EU Directive. The Government has considered the question of the possible impact 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8173"> of the Directive on Australian trade opportunities with EU countries and will continue to monitor this issue closely. However, the interpretation of the EU Directive is still under consideration by the EU. In addition, the EU Directive contains a number of exceptions to these restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) See answer to Question (7). The decision not to implement a legislative privacy regime for the private sector was preceded by an analysis of the submissions received in response to the Department's discussion paper, Privacy Protection in the Private Sector, and other consultations by Government with industry and other relevantly interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Business costs from any deviation from a national approach to protection of privacy in the private sector would only be able to be assessed when the nature of the differences was known. As indicated in answer to a previous question, ongoing discussions between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories about extending privacy protection to the private sector are aimed at reaching an agreed national approach.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(16) I am advised that generally contractors and subcontractors are located on Departmental premises. Access to Departmental data bases is limited to all personnel, including contractors, on a "need to know" basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(18) Yes. I am informed that the Department has an electronic mail policy document which is part of a wider IT security policy framework. The relevant section of the electronic mail policy is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"You should NOT send material via e&hyphen;mail which constitutes personal information about another person without that person's consent. Sending e&hyphen;mail messages that contain personal information about another person without that person's consent may breach the Privacy Act 1988."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) I am informed that the Department would be unlikely to outsource data that it considers to be of a sensitive nature. An example of such data would be certain sensitive law enforcement and national security information held by the Department. The Department currently does not outsource its IT services but does contract out some aspects of IT support by engaging consultants to work on an hourly basis at the Department's direction. To the extent that the consultants provide assistance in relation to the above material they are covered by the safeguards outlined in response to Questions 10&mdash;18.</PARA>

Postcodes of the job seeker or provider which is attached to each payment are used to determine the location of the LMP activity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question to the former Minister for Science and Technology:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) This statement was included in the text of the report, but was not a conclusion of the Research Reactor Review (RRR). The report of the Research Reactor Review (RRR) provides a useful background for Government decisions on the question of an on&hyphen;going research reactor capability in Australia, but its recommendations and conditions are not pre&hyphen;requisites for those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The RRR, which was established by the previous Government and reported to it, was a public inquiry into the need for a replacement research reactor. Its report set out a number of conditions which it considered, if satisfied, would make it appropriate for a positive decision to be made on a replacement reactor after about five years. As outlined in the responses to Questions on Notice Nos 561 and 633, the conditions of the RRR have been generally satisfied. In the circumstances, it is apparent that nothing useful could be achieved by another public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The RRR made an observation about a panel process, not a recommendation. An assessment of the proposal under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974</EMPHASIS>  is the next appropriate step. The assessment process will be by way of an environmental impact statement, and will provide the opportunity for members of the public to raise any issues that might be of concern to them in relation to the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Mayor of Sutherland initially requested another public inquiry. However, his subsequent Mayoral Minute, which was supported by the Sutherland Shire Council at its meeting on 8 September 1997, "acknowledged the Federal Government for making the hard decision to replace the ageing reactor at Lucas Heights with the most advanced technology available and not to create a reprocessing facility, and supported and recognised the Federal Government for calling for a full and open EIS into the replacement reactor."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) The suitability of a number of regions for a research reactor was considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The application of the criteria at 5(c), below, to these regions indicated their relative unattractiveness, compared with the known and proven site at Lucas Heights. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(In addition, at sites other than Lucas Heights, most or all of the facilities and infrastructure which support the present reactor, or depend on it, including the radiopharmaceutical production facilities, would have to be duplicated. The estimated total cost at those sites would be more than double the estimated cost of constructing a replacement reactor at Lucas Heights. Moreover, even if the replacement reactor were sited elsewhere, the Lucas Heights site must continue to operate for the production of radiopharmaceuticals from isotopes produced in the National Medical Cyclotron in Sydney, and for the care and maintenance of the HIFAR reactor, pending its final decommissioning. Operations at two sites would add significantly to costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The selection of a site requires consideration of the applicable site selection criteria together with the requirements of the reactor users. These criteria have been developed jointly by ANSTO and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, using international guidelines, and cover such aspects as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Health and safety: low seismicity and stable geology; low cyclonic activity and low flood potential; favourable airborne dispersion characteristics and low potential for waterborne pathways; not affected by other hazardous or incompatible land use; feasible emergency response capability from local emergency services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Environmental protection: not in unique ecological or conservation areas; without potential for a reactor to have any significant adverse impact on the physical or cultural environment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Availability of resources: adequate and reliable power and water supplies; proximity to reliable service providers and contractors;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Accessibility: within reasonable road travel of a major, preferably international, airport to facilitate shipment of radiopharmaceuticals; same day travel from major centres of research; proximity for staff to residential and research centres; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cost factors: cost of site&hyphen;related construction, infrastructure and land acquisition; operating costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Technical evaluations of siting characteristics were not undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) As noted in part (3) above, the replacement research reactor proposal will undergo an environmental assessment in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, and that process will provide the opportunity for members of the public to raise issues that might be of concern to them. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8191">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The need for a replacement reactor will be outlined in the environmental impact study. The question of alternatives to a reactor will also be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The feasibility of importing medical radioisotopes was examined in the RRR in 1993. The report of that review is publicly available. The evidence of the RRR and the Government's experience over time with the importation of radiopharmaceuticals has led to the conclusion that it would not be practicable or desirable to rely on imports.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The ERDC was not consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) The decision to wind up ERDC was taken in the context of the Government's overall fiscal objectives. However, the Government continues to play a prominent role in direct funding of energy R&amp;D through CSIRO and initiatives such as the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program, the R&amp;D Start Program and the Renewable Energy Industry Program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The document What's New, What's Different is primarily an internal departmental publication used to inform staff of Budget measures which affect the Social Security portfolio. The statistic quoted was derived from the Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers 1993 and has been present in departmental documents for some years.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8195"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, following a request from the Geelong Community Legal Centre for clarification of the source and validity of the ABS data cited in What's New, What's Different, the ABS advised that the data had not been correctly interpreted. The figures provided to the Department did not refer to the population of CDA children but the population of children (under 16 years) in families receiving CDA. As a result the ABS advises that it is not possible to draw any conclusions (either positive or negative) from this data about the conditions or level of impairment of children attracting CDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the data from the ABS Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers cannot be interpreted as indicating that 21 per cent of children on CDA have no handicap, the Department has other data which suggest that a figure in excess of 20 per cent is realistic. Other data include information from the feasibility study of the new assessment tool conducted by Coopers and Lybrand in 1995 and the field testing of the new assessment tool conducted by Ernst and Young in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) As indicated above, the data quoted from the ABS Survey were misinterpreted by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am happy to offer Senator Allison a briefing from my Department about the new CDA assessment tool.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
