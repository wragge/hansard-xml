<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, can I say to Senator West that I think she has a very great responsibility. The very important office of Deputy President and Chairman of Committees of the Senate has taken a great battering over recent months. The arrangements that were arrived at last year have diminished this office very significantly in the eyes of the Australian community. I think it has diminished the standing of all parliamentarians, I think it has diminished the standing of the Senate, and I think it has diminished the standing of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator West that I think she has a crucial role in rebuilding the confidence of the Australian community in our parliament.

Sue, I think you are competent, I think you are fair, I think you are straightforward and, above all, Sue, you are honest. Sue, even though your election to this position may have taken some nine months longer than we on this side of the chamber would have liked, I think it represents a triumph of political principle in your case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make clear again, as I have said in recent debates in relation to the positions of Deputy President and President of the Senate, that the opposition is committed to the convention that the President of the Senate represent the party of government and that the Deputy President be a member of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, Sue, as a fellow member of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, that your career has not always been easy. I remember particularly your great victory for Labor in the 1990 half&hyphen;Senate election. Nearly 3&half; million votes were cast in that election and your victory over Senator Puplick, then of course a senior coalition frontbencher, was incredibly close&mdash;just 490 votes. That was very important to the Labor Party. I suppose I should say that last year you lost another close ballot by four votes, that being for the Deputy Presidency of the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present to the Senate a statement dated 8 April 1997 by Mrs Christine Smith, and a covering letter of the same date from solicitors acting on her behalf. These documents were received in my office
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the office of the Clerk of the Senate on that day. Because of the significance of the documents, I directed that they be provided to all party leaders in the Senate and independent senators, and that was done on the same day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators Margetts and Bolkus have each raised with me, by letters dated 9 and 10 April 1997 respectively, a matter of privilege pursuant to standing order 81. The essence of the matter they have raised is that, if the statement by Mrs Christine Smith dated 8 April 1997 is true, her statement and Senator Colston's statement provided to me and presented to the Senate on 24 March 1997 are both false and would have been known to be false by both Senator Colston and Mrs Smith. This raises the possibility that false and misleading statements have been deliberately made to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am required by standing order 81 to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have precedence, having regard to criteria set out in the Senate's privilege resolution no. 4. These criteria are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for Senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the existence of a remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rulings of my predecessors have held that a matter should be given precedence if it is capable of being held by the Senate as conforming to criterion (a). The Senate and the Standing Committee of Privileges have always taken very seriously any suggestion that the Senate or its committees have been presented with false or misleading information, and there are a number of relevant reports of the Standing Committee of Privileges which have been endorsed by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to criterion (b), I am advised that there is no remedy other than an inquiry by the Senate in relation to this matter. The
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2646"> reason for this is that the statements by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith, having been presented to the Senate and their publication authorised by the Senate pursuant to standing order 167, those statements are proceedings in parliament within the meaning of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and, therefore, cannot be used in evidence in any substantive way before any court or tribunal. I am advised that there is, therefore, no remedy available through any legal proceedings, if the statements were false or misleading. Criterion (b) is, therefore, clearly met. I have, therefore, determined that a motion to refer this matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges may have precedence over other business, in accordance with standing order 81.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question has been raised whether any inquiry by the Senate into this matter should await the outcome of police investigations of Senator Colston's travelling allowance claims and any consequent legal proceedings. That is a question for the Senate to determine. I table letters from Senators Margetts and Bolkus, and the advice I received from the Clerk of the Senate. Senator Margetts and Senator Bolkus may now give a notice of motion which will have precedence over all other business on the next day of sitting.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2647"> (12.52 p.m.)&mdash;On the issue we are dealing with, there are a range of amendments we have moved in respect of the advance instalment. We had, I think, when we last left this issue, commenced some discussion about the advance instalment provisions. The advance instalment provision, in our view, represents one of the most atrocious aspects of this ongoing saga&mdash;shambles&mdash;of the superannuation tax provisions. If an individual has to pay the advance instalment, that is, 7&half; per cent of the 15 per cent tax, the provisions require the individual to pay the following year's tax liability in advance. In other words, the government is collecting half its revenue from the second year in the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also assumes that an individual will have an ongoing tax liability. Before I explain why this is outrageous from an equitable point of view, I would like to make a few other comments. The government is attempting to bring half its revenue from the second year forward into the first year. Of course, the effect of pushing back the dates when the surcharge debt for 1996&hyphen;97 is payable, in conjunction with the advance instalment, has led to one outcome&mdash;a huge amount of revenue being collected in the year 1999&hyphen;200. It strikes me that it is not coincidence that the government is manipulating its revenue in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is manipulating&mdash;fiddling, if you like&mdash;its revenue. It is seeking to raise the maximum amount of revenue in 1999&hyphen;2000 that it possibly can. Something exciting may happen in the 1999&hyphen;2000 financial year and that will be an election. So the government is trying to manipulate, in our view, its revenue collection for the purposes of its political campaign that is more than likely to fall during that period. Of course, it does not hurt the government that a large part of the revenue that would have been raised in 1996&hyphen;97 will not now be collected until 1997&hyphen;98. It inflates the budget bottom line in that year as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note that the government does not propose to insert a line item in the budget statements indicating the amount of money that the commissioner will have to refund due to the incorrect collection of moneys. We
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would note strongly that, should our amendments on advance instalments fail, the government should be required to put this liability to refund Australians' superannuation money, which should not have been collected in the first place, with interest as a separate line item in the budget. This is particularly true in the context of the government's alleged commitment to budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going on to the equity issues associated with the problems that a consequent of this advance instalment provision: how can this be a fair tax on superannuation when individuals who should not be required to pay the tax in the first place are required also to pay an advance instalment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, from all the evidence given to us&mdash;and the government has not been able to rebut it&mdash;that there will be at least one million lower and middle income earners who will be required to pay the superannuation tax in the first year, that is, 15 per cent of their superannuation contributions of lower and middle income earners in the first year, on top of the existing 15 per cent tax, with another 7&half; per cent advance instalment on top of that. And the number of people, particularly in the first year of the superannuation tax, who should not have to pay the tax but will end up paying the tax will be very significant indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are, in the main, going to be part&hyphen;time, casual, itinerant workers for which funds do not have tax file numbers&mdash;they do not have, at the moment, any tax file numbers for the purpose of this legislation&mdash;and they are going to be hit with, as I said, that 15 per cent existing tax, another full 15 per cent tax on top of the existing tax, plus another 7&half; per cent instalment tax; and it gets worse. That money, which is effectively being taxed at the rate of 37&half; per cent, will also be taxed at the rate of 15 per cent when members collect their money on reaching age 55 or whatever their retirement age is. That is a total of 52&half; per cent tax on lower and middle income earners' superannuation contributions&mdash;52&half; per cent, more than half.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp has got it because he is looking forward to the windfall in revenue that is going to accrue to the government as a consequence. It also magnifies dramatically the effect on individuals who receive a once&hyphen;off payment such as an eligible termination payment&mdash;or payments from the proceeds of a book, the sale of a farm, payment for an art work, whatever it may be&mdash;where their payment is artificially pushed above the $70,000 threshold, the so&hyphen;called higher income bracket that is supposed to be caught by these new tax provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once they have accrued the original tax debt, they will be liable to pay the advance instalment tax until they can prove to the commissioner that they are no longer above the income threshold level for payment of the 15 per cent tax on superannuation. So we have an incredible position where the government says it does not want to hit these particular people, but many of them will be hit by this new superannuation tax. Then they have to go along to the taxation commissioner and prove why the tax should not have been collected in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that where an individual does not provide their tax file number in the first year in particular this is a dramatic problem. Since we last considered this legislation I have had cause to talk to the secretary, I think, of the motor industry superannuation fund, which has about 225,000 members. They have been, for other purposes&mdash;not for the purposes of this legislation&mdash;circulating letters to members to try to collect tax file numbers and, unfortunately, they have had a response from only a few thousand of the 225,000 members of that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, if this legislation passes the Senate in its current form, the funds are going to wage a very vigorous campaign between May and effectively November, because the tax is payable in December and they have to start processing the collection of the tax. But we do know that, in the case of the fund covering the motor industry, of those 225,000 people, most of whom earn less than $70,000, about half will be hit with this new tax in the first year, because they will not realise the importance of the tax file number. And if that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is any indication, the figure of one million lower and middle income earners being affected in the first year is conservative. This is one million people who earn less than $70,000 being hit with this new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I wish to raise with respect to this advance instalment of the surcharge concerns the fact that Australians do believe that privacy is very important. The latest survey showed that 70 per cent of Australians believe that it is a very important issue. The imposition of a penalty tax is far different from the refusal of benefits in regard to the providing of tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think anyone envisaged, when the tax file system was introduced, that if you failed to produce your tax file number on a `voluntary' basis&mdash;I emphasise the inverted commas&mdash;you would be hit with a tax. That is your choice: provide the tax file number voluntarily or you are hit with a massive new tax on your superannuation contributions. I submit to the Senate that that is an impossible principle for the government to justify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the issues I have touched on we will be dealing with a little later, because they go to the heart of our concern about collecting the full 15 per cent tax from people whose tax file numbers are not with the superannuation funds. That will be at least a million people&mdash;probably more in the first year. That is more people than are supposed to be hit by this tax who earn more than $70,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the advance instalment in the first year magnifies the effect of this, because people who have to pay the 15 per cent because the funds do not have the tax file numbers will have to pay another 7&half; per cent in the first year. The government says, `It's all okay. We don't want to tax these people.' But the reality is that, if the government had any understanding of the structure and nature of the superannuation industry, it would know that these million&hyphen;plus lower and middle income earners will be hit by this tax because of the way in which the superannuation industry is structured and, in particular, because the government refuses to call this a tax; it calls it a surcharge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2649">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not want the tax collected directly. It has tried to hide the tax by getting the superannuation funds to collect it for them in the hope that no&hyphen;one will notice the tax when they get their statements at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. I think that it is pretty much wishful thinking from the government, frankly, because of their lack of understanding of the industry, that people are not going to notice another 15 per cent tax and another 7&half; per cent advance instalment tax on top of the existing 15 per cent tax and watch the bottom line effect on their superannuation benefits. Labor is certainly going to be drawing it to the attention of the millions of Australian taxpayers who have superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the advance instalment tax in the first year magnifies dramatically at the worst possible time the effects of this new superannuation tax on those people who should not be paying the tax. It is fundamental in our contention that the advance instalment tax should be removed from the bills. This will not affect the bottom line of the government's revenue. All it is doing is saying, if you want a 15 per cent tax on superannuation, you collect the revenue from those taxpayers in the first year&mdash;the 15 per cent&mdash;and you collect the 15 per cent in the second year and the third year. It will not affect your forward estimates over the next three years but it will avoid this very serious problem of magnifying the effect on those many lower and middle income earners who are going to have to pay this tax who should not have to pay it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is not to forget the higher income earners who are required to have this advance instalment&mdash;higher income earners earning more than $70,000, who were assured by this government that there would be no increases in existing taxes and no introduction of new taxes. You wake up the day after the last budget in August last year and you suddenly find, if you are a higher income earner, that your tax rate on superannuation is moving up from 30 per cent to 45 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That breached the government's fundamental commitment at the last election. It has had serious consequences for the superannuation
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry. The government says, `Don't worry. This is all clear. There are no problems.' We have been hearing that for the last nine months, and the problems keep piling on the problems. More legal problems were mentioned last week by Justice Davies, a sitting Federal Court judge, in respect of the legality of all of this. But if the government persists and this is passed we will see what the courts have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that higher income earners should have to pay an advance instalment of a tax when they were told at the last election that there would be no new tax at all. As I say, they will wake up the day after the budget and their tax rate on super will have moved from 30 per cent to 45 per cent, with another 7&half; per cent advance instalment this year. It is absolutely outrageous. I have not met&mdash;and Senator Watson well knows; we have had to sit through the hearings of the Senate superannuation committee&mdash;any lawyer, accountant, superannuation expert or tax expert who thinks this is a good approach on tax policy. But the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assures us, when he looks Australians in the eye, that this is not a tax; it is a surcharge. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I repeat that: the assessments will be delayed until the May 1998 instalment. The ATO will allow superannuation providers to advise the ATO of tax file numbers received after the 15 December reporting deadline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that providers and members have until around May 1998&mdash;that is, 12 months hence&mdash;to give their tax file number to the fund or the ATO to avoid a surcharge assessment being raised. Of course, if all fails and a surcharge assessment is raised because of non-quotation of a tax file number, the bill allows for the surcharge to be refunded when they subsequently quote their tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I have taken you through the steps which will be taken by the government. Let me just give you an example. With the matching of member data provided by the funds with ATO income tax client records, the common name and address, date of birth criteria will be used to link individual member account details and their ATO recorded tax file number. In turn, of course, the tax return data will be used to establish their taxable income level. The ATO anticipates a very substantial success rate using this method. Of course, this does depend upon

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am putting to you that we will be making very great efforts to ensure that those who have not supplied their tax file numbers are contacted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final point&mdash;and perhaps this is the appropriate time to record it&mdash;is that a number of new amendments were given to the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2652"> government today just before 12.30 p.m. We have been in constant communication with Senator Sherry's office and advisers seeking copies of these amendments, which were flagged, so they could be properly analysed so, if there was any room for discussion, constructive discussion could have occurred. Despite the fact that we have had a five&hyphen;week break, these amendments were dropped on us just after noon today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious issue. We understand that at times these things are difficult to produce, but I would have thought that, in a reasonable spirit of making sure that this debate could proceed at a reasonable level, the amendments would not have been dropped off at the very last moment, particularly as I have been exhorted from time to time by Senator Sherry in his office to ensure that they have copies of government amendments as quickly and efficiently as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put that on the table because I do not think that this is a fair way to run this debate. Whatever the Labor Party may have had in mind, it is an approach which makes it very difficult for other non-government senators to consider the implications of what is being put forward. Senator Sherry, I think that you would agree that every time you have contacted me I have bent over backwards to assist, and I think that it is a pity that after five weeks, again, at the very last moment&mdash;precisely, I might say, when this bill came on again&mdash;the Labor Party produced its amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it is a complex bill and I know that there were difficulties with drafting resources. I certainly did not make a big issue at that time, but I think today it was a pity that we received these amendments so late.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) will support these superannuation bills because they are taxes on the rich, and this is a rarity. We will support them even though they are a very botched effort, rather than leave anyone in doubt that we think it is a good principle. The SCS is a very badly botched effort, and I want to speak a little bit about the issues to make it clear what we think is still wrong with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills are a mess. The government has taken two essentially simple ideas and made a dog's dinner of them. I will say at the outset that the government called this a surcharge and I will call it a tax. I will continue to call it so. The first simple idea is that the rich are not shouldering a fair portion of their social responsibility. The social structure creates the conditions that allow them to make their wealth, but they are not contributing back enough of the wealth to support that social system. In short, the firs t simple idea is that the rich are not paying enough tax and that they should pay more. This is interesting, because we have just been hearing about more tax breaks in relation to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second simple idea is to do something about the way wealthy individuals can minimise their taxes through salary sacrifice packages that entail extra employer contributions to an employee's superannuation. They do this with the cooperation of their employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple solution to the first issue would be to scrap these bills and increase the tax paid at the top marginal rate or create a further margin. We considered this and had a simple amendment drafted in two versions, one increasing the current top rate to 49 per cent, the other creating a new rate of 49 per cent for those making over $70,000. Unfortunately, we were informed that it is too extensive an amendment for the committee stage. Part of the problem with that is how quickly these bills were rushed through at the end of last session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple solution to the second issue is to eliminate employer deductions for superannuation contributions beyond what is required by law. We were told that we could put this amendment, and we will do so. It makes using superannuation and salary sacrifice much less attractive to the employer and assures it is taxed at at least the full company rate. It will mean that employees opting for salary sacrifice will lose the company rate of 36 per cent plus the surcharge of 15 per cent, or a total of 51 per cent on those specific contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first complication by the government to these simple ideas is that the government
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2653"> wants to tax the rich indirectly by taxing the superannuation of the rich. It wants to tax all their superannuation rather than just the part that has been done as a salary sacrifice. I suppose this is on the principle that they get a lot of superannuation; they do not need tax incentives to invest or to save for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It then gets immensely more complicated, as others here in the Senate committee have highlighted and will continue to highlight. The government, to collect their tax and not call it a tax, have had to create a whole structure to demand that the superannuation funds collect information, discriminate between contributors on the basis of their notional income by calling employer superannuation contributions employee income, and then the government will collect the taxpayers' tax not from taxpayers but from the superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having got into this murky world, it then has also to deal with termination payments. The result is seven bills, essentially six new acts, and a raft of consequential changes to other bills, rather than half a dozen lines of text in the Tax Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into the range of problems here. As Senator Sherry said, the most sensible thing would have been to withdraw these bills and redraft them. I do not think this would have been impossible, since I believe that there is general support for dealing with the basic issues. It is the implementation that is the problem and that creates objections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that these bills were rushed along in the last hours of last session instead of receiving proper consideration and debate has exacerbated the situation. The government did little to work on an acceptable range of amendments to correct bad aspects of these bills, which were almost certainly drafted as they were considered&mdash;in a rush that precluded proper consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major problems&mdash;the one the ALP amendments before us seek to address&mdash;is that, amongst everything else, the government has decided that it is not enough to collect the quasi tax on superannuation contributions. It also wants to collect it on probable future contributions. Just as an aside, it does
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lend weight to the potential for perhaps putting some issues of very large, complex amendments to very large, complex bills out to further committees so that less of the chamber time might be used. We would have more of these issues sorted out when the matter came back into the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should we do? The government is already making a rotten mess out of superannuation, and not only superannuation of the rich. Superannuation funds are expected to penalise everyone who has not registered their tax file number&mdash;TFN&mdash;making a further mockery of the idea that there was anything remotely voluntary about using a tax file number as a universal identifier or a default Australia Card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, superannuation funds will have to have large cash reserves, tying up assets in a way that should be completely unnecessary in a financial institution based on payouts upon retirement rather than on demand and it will impact on the overall performance of funds. Already with a level of taxation of 15 per cent plus 15 per cent plus 7&half; per cent for advances, it is highly unlikely that investments for anyone in such a category would be lucrative. For ordinary employees, the idea of putting in extra money&mdash;an employee contribution&mdash;starts to be ludicrous. Why bother?  After all, the return on superannuation funds currently runs only to about seven per cent per annum on many large funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the tax file number issues generally, the ATO has already had a tax file number for a taxpayer. They are the ones who, on the basis of information from the superannuation funds, do an assessment which the superannuation funds then pay. I cannot understand why, in this situation, the ATO could not supply the tax file number to a superannuation fund or just keep the record to themselves or just provide a nod as to whether or not the income is in the right area. After all, a superannuation fund is basically different to a bank account. People do not simply open and close superannuation funds. They do not draw on them unless they are retired. In most cases it is their employer who is paying the money in and who decides which fund to pay into. Under small accounts legislation, it should be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2654"> the case that people's superannuation money is consolidated into one account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the excuse for the ATO not making an effort to work out a taxpayer's tax file number? Why can they not work it out based on a taxpayer's name and employer? The employers already will be remitting PAYE tax, so the tax office has some information in its big database. Why is it so necessary to give this tax file number to private companies yet the employee name and that of the employer is enough in most cases for the ATO to establish what the tax file number is? Instead, you seek to penalise people to a huge degree, more than doubling their superannuation tax obligation, because their superannuation company does not supply the Australian Taxation Office with a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole tax file number issue is important here. It may not matter much if there are all these higher charges on the rich. But in the committee's evidence, Ms Howes of the IFA said that in the first year&mdash;before employees who actually read their superannuation statements get a shock from what is on them&mdash;there is likely to be only a 40 per cent compliance rate to a request for tax file numbers. Senator Sherry gave much lower figures for one of the major funds. I, for one, think it might be even lower than 40 per cent. In evidence, Ms Howes stated that this will mean that 60 per cent or more of superannuation fund members will be subject to both the 15 per cent surcharge and the five per cent advance, and superannuation funds will be responsible for finding the money and having assets to cover this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATO gave evidence that they will make efforts to reduce this. But, given that few people are good at doing their taxes, I am not certain it will be effective. Certainly, even if it is not 60 per cent, there is likely to be a large number of people making under $70,000 who will not put in their tax file number or will not do so in time in the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There might just be some people who for principle reasons do not feel they should be forced to surrender that private information. Think of that. There might be some who actually do not have the income or who actually believe they should not be required
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to surrender that information. What kind of a dog's dinner is it going to be when we deal with people who, based on conscience, think that they should not have to surrender it? This is at a time when we are being told that we can no longer expect that governments will keep that information private because it is all going to be privatised anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such a scenario, it is hard to justify having such a requirement for an advance. In fact, it is hard to justify the superannuation funds having to pay someone else's personal income tax at all. This advance is to be made without many of the safeguards that there are in provisional income tax. There are no mechanisms for variation. Superannuation funds are obliged to pay this tax up front, even borrowing money to do so. This will have an effect on fund outcomes for all members, whether they are rich or not and whether they give their tax file number or not. This is the major issue with advances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last session, and before the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) prematurely moved for progress to be reported, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) was saying that contributions will have been received from 1 July to 15 June and that the advance instalment is due on 15 June&mdash;that is, a collection on contributions already made. Why, then, is it an advance? Why is it based on a number calculated from the previous tax amount? Why not, at the very least, tax people on the contributions they have actually made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject, why not wait until the normal tax is normally due? Why not base the tax that is due on what is actually due based on real contributions and real income? Do we have another little bit of self&hyphen;assessment, and who has costed that out in our community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, I do not think Senator Kemp's arguments hold water. I do not think this implication that the amount is known, is in pocket and covers virtually the whole year corresponds with the need for an advance, the need for basing that advance on past income, the need for providing liquid assets or the need for superannuation companies to borrow money at interest which will either be paid to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2655"> the victims of tax file number mania or the general members of funds. I do not see why there is a need for these advances. I cannot see how this is essential for the functioning of the tax on the rich. We are prepared to support the ALP amendments to remove this particular aspect of the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to think about the consequences of moving along this direction without considering some of the checks and balances that have been suggested by the ALP in this regard. We see that part of the consequence is moving from a situation where, as a community, we see pensions as a right. We are moving into a situation of high complexity. We are moving to a situation where somehow the rights of private corporations are overruling the rights of individuals&mdash;their right of privacy, their right of being able to make their own decisions about their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is amazing coming from a government of so-called free enterprise and free choice. Very little choice is involved here except for the people at the very highest levels of the income scale. The problem&mdash;to be as unkind as I am going to be at this stage&mdash;started with Labor and the assumption that, if you bring in further superannuation to replace pensions, somehow or other successive governments will not pick this up and turn it against the average person in the street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what has happened. This is what I said a couple of years ago would happen, and I am now saying, `I told you so.' We are losing pension rights. We have a situation where pensions may be the equivalent of the 1930s dole, which is now becoming the 1997 dole: you get it only if you can prove you cannot live otherwise. Maybe we are going to have `work for the pension' in the future along with these ridiculous superannuation schemes. In the meantime, we are prepared to support a fairer superannuation schedule. Please rethink your ridiculous schemes and support the ALP's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

There are two or three additional amendments that you saw this morning. I have a surprise for you&mdash;we have a new one. I had a call in respect of a further problem, and we will get to that a little later with this surcharge issue. It is relatively minor in the context of all the problems we face but a very serious problem for people who are military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp&mdash;and Senator Margetts touched on this issue earlier&mdash;where a person has a legitimate objection to providing a tax file number because of privacy concerns, has there been any consideration of how they are to be treated when they say, `I do not wish to provide my tax file number for fundamental privacy reasons'?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go to a couple of points that Senator Kemp made in his earlier contribution because I think they show very clearly and succinctly that, behind the facade of a surcharge, this government is thinking of the application of this legislation in terms of a tax&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. You only need to go to his exact words about his government's efforts, which they claim will allow them to closely monitor the implementation of this legislation and promote the need for people to lodge their tax file numbers. Indeed, the government intends to enforce this&mdash;in Senator Kemp's words&mdash;through the Tax Pack; through the ATO. They have advocated, in response to these amendments and in placating the Democrats, that part of the process will be to delay this to allow the tax department to effectively seek the information from taxpayers in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask a number of questions with respect to this. Minister, have you endeavoured to cost out the administration of this side of making this botched up scheme work? Have you taken into account exactly what the imposition, financially, will be upon
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2656"> the taxation department in advocating another layer to make this botched up system work? What is the estimate of the cost of the placating words you have offered the Democrats in return for their opposition to what are, I think, our worthy and sensible amendments? If you could answer that at this point in time, it would be quite useful. I suspect, though, that you will refer the issue back to the tax department and seek information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think that, for all we have heard so far in this debate in the committee stage, there is no other conclusion you can draw except that this is a manipulation of revenue on behalf of the government. Senator Kemp, in his efforts to explain and give something of a response of substance to this chamber, has relied primarily on interjections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this government is just going to the next extreme in putting together a piece of legislation that is obviously policy on the hop. The latest process in dealing with some of the Democrats' ideas, again, is essentially quite a fundamental change in their approach. They are now saying that they will delay the collection of TFNs, whereas I do recall, the last time I was in this chamber, that it was absolutely essential for the government to get that information out on the table very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That goes to the next issue. If we are dealing with a surcharge, why is the government insisting upon the close role of the tax department? There is no explanation other than that this government is trying to utilise a secondary body to collect what they are calling a surcharge but which is indeed a tax. To do this raises a whole lot of other questions with regard to the legality of this legislation and the ability of this government to use funds to collect tax on behalf of their members, not only with respect to the current financial year but also&mdash;going to the heart of our amendments&mdash;with respect to advance instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To utilise superannuation funds in this way is, as Senator Margetts has said, a complete betrayal of the way superannuation has been introduced to the Australian people. It is a complete betrayal because, in the past, there has been support for superannuation as a viable retirement income option for many
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians. To manipulate taxation on contributions at this point in time will not just leave us with a flawed piece of legislation&mdash;which, no doubt, will be an administrative nightmare and unfair in its application, particularly for low&hyphen; and middle&hyphen;income earners&mdash;it will leave us with a legacy of diminished faith and trust in superannuation as a product for all Australians. This will be the result of the government's willingness to tamper with the application of taxation to superannuation&mdash;a tax which the government is still calling a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I would appreciate it if you could give the chamber a response to those questions I asked earlier. Could you tell this committee what the government intends to do to try and restore the damage that has been done to superannuation generally in the eyes of the public and to their faith in superannuation as being a genuine option for retirement savings, whether you are a low&hyphen; or middle&hyphen;income earner or, indeed, a high&hyphen;income earner. I agree with the point made again by my colleagues supporting these amendments that higher income earners do have other options. Why should they burden themselves with an additional tax? They will look elsewhere; they do have options available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, you used the word `choice' but you are denying low&hyphen; and middle&hyphen;income earners a choice. You are denying them options that would otherwise be there for them in the same way that you used rhetoric about the child care cuts giving more choice to women. That is a fallacy, as were your words about increasing choice for consumers in respect of superannuation. You spoke about `individual choice' with respect to supplying the TFN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you said, Senator Kemp, was that members of funds have an individual choice about whether or not they supply their tax file number to their fund and whether or not they are prepared to bear the burden of this 15 per cent tax slug. That is a great choice! It typifies the choice that we have under this government: it is a choice that either you do it or you pay a financial penalty. In this case, you pay an extra 15 per cent. Great choice! With child care, to use an analogy, you either
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2657"> pay the increased child care costs or you leave work. That is the sort of choice we have under this government and it is as unacceptable in this debate as it is in the other debates relating to cuts to other social services. It is not choice; it is financial blackmail.</PARA></SPEECH>

If it has been damaged, it has been damaged because of the somewhat hysterical comments that a number of people have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the funds are flowing very handsomely into superannuation. Just to console you, Senator Lundy, I will read an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A century ago Mark Twain sent a cable to Associated Press. It read, `The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.' In 1997, the do it yourself superannuation industry is putting out the same message.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the doomsdaying, super is even more popular with investors and the number of DIY funds is increasing at the rate of about 2,400 a month.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you are going around saying that superannuation is being damaged, you have to demonstrate, by more than just the rhetorical flourishes, that that is occurring. When you stand up&mdash;if you wish to stand up; I am not encouraging you to&mdash;maybe you might like to actually produce a fact which demonstrates the very substantive point that you have asserted. I do believe that, on the basis of the statistics at the moment, we are seeing funds flowing into superannuation at increasing rates. I have quoted that recent article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  to show that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the issue of conscientious objections, which was raised by Senator Margetts, I point out that there are people, and Senator Margetts raised the issue, who have a conscientious objection to quoting a TFN to the funds. I am advised by the tax

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are the major issues for most Australians, Senator Bolkus, the issues which you missed when you were in government. In addressing this question, it is worth comparing our achievements over just one year with those of 13 years of Labor. The record of Labor should always be remembered. Labor gave the people of Australia home interest rates of about 17 per cent, if we think of 1989&hyphen;90, credit card interest rates of 25 per cent, the second highest prime interest rate in the world, record foreign debt and, when we came to office, a $10 billion black hole which the leadership of the Australian Labor Party said to the people of Australia during the election did not exist. `The books would be in the black,' the Australian people were told. The truth was a $10 billion black hole. That is what the new Howard government inherited and that is what the Howard government had to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we been able to do, springing from the first budget of the Howard government? The answer is: a great deal. First and perhaps foremost is the family tax initiative. We believed it was time to give back to those who had done it hardest under Labor some real benefit. We gave it back to two million eligible families. We gave back $1 billion in tax relief, even though we were at the same time addressing that $10 billion black hole. So those who had suffered most were given that taxation benefit, and it helps them.</PARA>

I ask the minister: what support does he have for his prime constituency in the Wilderness Society, which has been today protesting against the bulk carrier woodchip ship in Burnie exporting 40,000 tonnes of pure rainforest as woodchips to the pulp mills of Japan? Why has the minister agreed to his colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy licensing North Broken Hill, the world's biggest hardwood export woodchipper, to log large tracts of pure rainforest south of Burnie for export to the Northern Hemisphere as woodchips, and why did he advise the minister that no environmental

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in relation to government policy on forests, let me say that we are doing what we committed ourselves to do, that is, providing resource security for Australian industry that will help produce jobs whilst, on the other hand, contributing to development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system which will be the envy of the world. As you know, going for a target of 15 per cent of that which existed pre&hyphen;white settlement in Australia&mdash;some 50 per cent above the IUCN recommended level&mdash;is a very ambitious, but sensible, I would suggest, Senator Brown, environmental outcome and one which I would have thought you should applaud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in relation to the clearing of native vegetation for the re&hyphen;establishment of plantations&mdash;which, by and large, I think is a good thing and I think the more extensive the plantings of forests in Australia the less pressure there will be on native forests, which, I would have thought, you would say was a good thing as well, in principle&mdash;in the tests applying that re&hyphen;establishment, we had to be satisfied that it would not be required within the RFA system. We took advice from the CSIRO and we took advice from another authority from Tasmania and, basically, it met the criteria that we had earlier published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My memory of the matter&mdash;it is now some months ago&mdash;was that there was very little rainforest involved at all. I would like to re&hyphen;check that, but I think that that is the case. And if that is the case, Senator, then you are deliberately misleading the Senate today in order to add a bit of media interest to your story. By and large, I think that that is correct. Therefore, the outcome is consistent with our objective of a world&hyphen;class reserve system, an encouragement to the growth of plantation timber and also an allowable harvesting of native forest consistent with all the rules and safeguards that we set out that will enable the higher standards of ecological scrutiny to take place as well as provide job opportunities for Australia&mdash;Tasmania in particular, in this instance&mdash;and that is part of our goal.</PARA>

You may have a very different view. I do not know. But information was conveyed to me which did make it clear that there had been a very significant change in circumstances, and I did relay that to the Prime Minister's office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, including rainforests. Just be patient. Secondly, I gave advice to the minister, which was accepted, that a number of categories should be excluded to ensure that they would not be required within CRA. They included areas that contained, within an area with a national wilderness index, a rating of greater than or equal to 12 and also which classified as tall rainforests within the Woolnorth IBRA region on acid indigenous rock below 600 metres elevation. So pristine rainforest was actually excluded on my advice, beyond that it had already been voluntarily withdrawn by North.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, he would be aware&mdash;if he had been open and frank with us&mdash;that the assessment of the Forest Practices Board was to find that the Surrey Hills block was degraded. So all care was taken in relation to rainforest. The other side of the equation was that we believe 112 jobs were secured and an extra 70 jobs would be created by the decision. That is good for all Australians, particularly Tasmanians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to the accession of Senator Colston to the Deputy Presidency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Today we have been treated, yet again, to a very ugly spectacle of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) ducking and weaving, covering up and doing everything possible to try to extricate themselves from the tangled web that they have woven with Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all must have seemed so simple for the government just a few months into their term. They were approached, either directly or indirectly, by Senator Colston&mdash;a disgruntled senator who was ready to turn his back on the party of which he had been a member for a long time, the party that he had been elected to represent&mdash;in order for that senator to gain the trappings of office. Of course, Senator Hill, Senator Alston and Mr Howard just could not believe their luck. They knew how important it was going to be to get that one vote in the Senate&mdash;that one vote that gave them control, an assurance about a raft of legislation that would go through the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt for one minute that they knew that in supporting Senator Colston there would be a small amount of collateral damage for the government, but, of course, they were absolutely dazzled by the prospect of getting Senator Colston's vote. We all know how they secured that vote. The record shows how the Liberals secured Senator Colston's vote. Since Senator Colston's defection he has voted with the Liberals on every major piece of legislation, every major issue before this chamber on which his vote was crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this chamber we have seen the spectacle of Senator Alston going across the chamber, dragging Senator Colston from where he was sitting with the opposition and leading him across the chamber like a trained dog. We have seen Senator Campbell whispering in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2679"> Senator Colston's ear during a division to ensure that he came across. We have seen Senator Newman, Senator Hill and Senator Alston haranguing Senator Colston to change his vote during divisions on the social security legislation at the end of the sittings last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has Senator Colston done? He has always meekly complied with the government. What we did not know and what we still demand to know is what arrangements the government came to with Senator Colston, what the details were of this sleazy, slimy, underhand deal that Mr Howard and his government did with Senator Colston, and what the arrangements were that enabled the Liberal Party and the Howard government to secure the vote of Senator Colston. It was not just the deputy presidency&mdash;or was it? Was it the staff upgrade? Was it the government protection, support and defence in every adversity that came Senator Colston's way? Was it perhaps the promise of some sinecure at the end of Senator Colston's parliamentary career? These are the issues that the government has steadfastly refused to clarify. We are going to pursue them just as steadfastly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even today we have had the spectacle of Senator Alston unwilling to outline the nature of discussions that he had that involved Senator Colston and his staffer Mrs Smith. We would be very interested to hear more detail about that. We want to know whether and the extent to which Mr Howard and his henchmen in the chamber Senator Alston and Senator Hill are implicated in this ham&hyphen;fisted and dishonest attempt that Senator Colston made to exonerate himself from blame over his incorrect travel allowance claims. There are many issues to be answered. Senator Hill, Senator Alston, Mr Howard and his government have to front up to the fact that this is a sleazy deal and the public are entitled to know.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You may have always contested ballots, but you want a convention in place now so that someone is elected in the same way as you, Madam Deputy President, have been elected today. This is the same Senator Colston about whom your own Senator Gareth Evans said in 1983 when he wrote to your current leader, Mr Beazley:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is before entering on a police investigation which might have quite profoundly disturbing implications for Senator Colston's apparently delicately balanced family situation, quite apart from causing grave damage, whether unfairly or not, to his reputation in the event that the fact that the investigation became public knowledge, Senator Colston should be asked to provide a full and detailed explanation of the circumstances of his claims and be given time to pursue any documentation required. In all the circumstances, and given in particular that any such possible irregularities are routinely handled in private commercial organisations and other institutional settings, I believe it would be premature to set in train a police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were the words of your own Senator Gareth Evans in 1983 when referring to a request to have the matter relating to irregularities by Senator Colston referred to the Australian Federal Police. That is how you handled the situation in 1983&mdash;a situation which you now tell us had already occurred in 1982. That is the sort of extent that you would go to to protect a colleague, who at that stage was a member of your government, in order that nothing became public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Mr Beazley had been advised at the time to call in the police. He did not do so because of the efforts of Senator Evans to try to cover up what allegedly took place in 1983. Both Mr Beazley, your current leader, and Senator Evans have been trying to explain away their roles in the Colston affair since that investigation of 14 years was selectively leaked. Mr Beazley said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I ordered at the time was the sort of thorough investigation by my department which had not been done when the matter came to me.

Now I am not completely familiar with that because that happened after I left the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, let me respond to some things that Senator Ferguson said. The first offences committed by Senator Colston were under a Fraser government. The money was repaid under a Fraser government, under a Liberal minister Mr Newman. He claims that he wanted to refer it to the Federal Police, but none of those documents have been released to the opposition. We have no idea as to the veracity of his claims. Secondly, Senator Ferguson said that people on this side of the chamber knew of entitlement errors made by Senator Colston in 1983. I categorically deny it. I was never told. Mr Beazley or no&hyphen;one else passed that information to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2681">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that I held the portfolio of home affairs which covered ministerial and parliamentary services for about 15 months from July 1987 to October 1988. A whole range of information came across my desk about members of parliament&mdash;not involving criminality, I rush to add, but about breaches of entitlement and things that would embarrass them; things that affect Liberal ministers today. I have never once passed that information on to any of my party colleagues. It has remained confidential to me and will remain confidential to me for as long as I live. If a minister learns of things bordering on impropriety, it is not necessarily the process that they would in fact disclose them to their colleagues or anyone else if proper administrative solutions were available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say this: the fact is that what we have sought is what arrangements were made when Senator Colston was elected as Deputy President. The government I think has said on occasions, through the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Hill, that there were no inducements; there was no deal. When they were asked on the lesser matters whether there was an understanding or there were arrangements, we got no response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill had the cheek here to say that he had answered those questions last year. But the fact is that they were non-answers. Given the high moral ground that this government wants to take, where is the transparency? They are not willing to say what arrangements there were&mdash;the dates, the times and the length of all those discussions. There are people here in this chamber who were there at the initial discussions, even here now, but they will not disclose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Prime Minister proclaiming that he has adopted the high moral ground. Let us examine that claim right here. Why was Senator Colston dumped as Deputy President? Because the Liberal Party had to get out from under. Those opposite having defended in this chamber the statements put down in this chamber and then having had the rug pulled from under them, John Howard called a hasty press conference on 8 April and referred the matter to the Federal Police, even though we know he did not have the power
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to do that, even if it is on the record that he did not even consult with his Attorney-General&mdash;the panic was so strong. They just had to cut and run. So, after weeks and weeks of resisting calls from the opposition and editorials that these matters should go directly to the Federal Police, John Howard panics under public pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he did not say that night, `I find his vote tainted.' No, he waits until two opinion polls come out that decisively show that government support is eroding. So they had a cabinet meeting, had a discussion and think, `What can we do about this? We will come up with this new scam. We will say that his vote is tainted and we don't want it any more.' Having bought the vote themselves, it was no longer acceptable. Then we had the cheek of the Prime Minister this morning saying on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, `Senator Colston is entitled to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty.' We agree with that. But then he said that Senator Colston is entitled to his day in court. For heaven's sake, the police investigation is not even over. The DPP has not even been consulted and the Prime Minister has Senator Colston in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he is so innocent, why dump him as Deputy President? Why say his vote is tainted if he is innocent? It is that side that has absolutely convicted him in public in recent weeks, yet they are still professing the old chestnut of his innocence until proven guilty. The fact is that they bought Senator Colston's vote&mdash;by what means we do not know. But the truth comes out after a while. Senator Alston in his great defence of Senator Colston did not mention that he had met with Mrs Christine Smith; did not mention to us in the chamber that he had had discussions. He again was coy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point is that Senator Hill refuses to say what conversations he had with Senator Colston other than implicitly acknowledging that he had them. So much for transparency! So much for the high moral ground! So much for the Liberal Party! Senator Ferguson said that we voted for Senator Colston in 1990. We always ran candidates then. It was the Democrats who put him up, not us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those people have been office&hyphen;bearers; they have been members of the executive of a Labor government and saw fit to do nothing at all about a person who they now claim to be a crook. Did any of those people&mdash;or anyone else in the opposition, for that matter&mdash;tell Senator Hill or Senator Alston what they now claim had to be repaid in 1983? Not one person on the then opposition benches knew what they had covered up. They covered that up all the way through, so much so that they supported him. All of those people who I have talked about supported that same man for the position of Deputy President in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it therefore unreasonable to suspect that these people on the other side, who are now so righteous in everything they say, actually helped to camouflage what they now call a crime? They do not want to let Senator Colston have his judgment made outside; they want to convict him right here and now. Yet they did not see fit to do anything about it for

It is the Labor Party who were in charge of the books from 1983 until last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the fact is they cannot sheet home any blame to Senator Hill or Senator Alston. They covered it up. They covered up heaven only knows what, because I know there are other people in this place who are wandering around Australia at the moment with various people with whom they probably should not be. Why are they covering that up? That will probably be exposed in time, too. Why don't they look at that? But no, they are just focusing on one man. Let the man have his investigation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support Senator Faulkner's motion to take note of an answer. I draw the Senate's attention to the statement signed by Christine
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2683"> Smith which in fact repudiates the statement that she had made earlier. In her second statement, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24th March 1997, on arrival at the office</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the office in Parliament House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I received a telephone call from Senator Colston. He said in a particular drawer in his office were three letters which had been signed by him and a statement for me to sign. I understand these letters were typed by another staff member during the weekend. The statement for me to sign was based on the first draft which Senator Colston had drafted at my uncle's home on 2nd March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have heard today from Senator Alston that he has discussed, at one level, matters of no substance with Mrs Christine Smith; and, at another level, within the office of Senator Colston, the defence that he put up on 25 March which we now know to be a total fabrication. We said at the time, on 25 March, that it was a total fabrication. It was quite clear from the statements made by Senator Colston prior to the release of that statement that there was going to be, as he put it, `a believable statement'. But to us, and to most people in this country, a totally unbelievable statement was put before this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue here is: to what extent did the government get involved in the preparation of that statement? To what extent was there foreknowledge of the false nature of that statement? Quite clearly, Senator Alston is going around the coalition benches saying to all and sundry that he was instrumental in procuring Senator Colston's vote in the lead&hyphen; up to the last federal budget and the Senate's vote on the Telstra sale bill. It is quite apparent that senior members of the government in this chamber took it upon themselves to secure Senator Colston's vote in the lead&hyphen;up to last year's budget and the Telstra bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is really at the heart of this matter. It goes to the very issue of the integrity of the legislative process in this country: the manner in which arrangements were made to secure the defection of Senator Colston to ensure the government had a majority in this chamber to secure its budget processes and, of course, the sale of Telstra. There can be no more fundamental national issue when it goes to the integrity of the legislative process within this country. There can be no more
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basic question in terms of the integrity of the political system in this country than the whole issue of vote buying in this chamber. It raises very basic issues that can only ultimately be resolved when the whole privileges issue is taken through and when we get to the very bottom of the question of the way in which documents pertaining to make false statements to this chamber were presented to this chamber, alleging that certain arrangements had been made in Senator Colston's office which, in fact, had not been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question really arises: to what extent is this government implicated in the fabrication of those lies? To what extent are senior members of this government implicated in the whole travesty of justice that led to the defection of Senator Colston from the Labor Party to effectively join the coalition in this chamber, to deprive the people of Queensland of their true vote and to undermine the democratic process in this country? To what extent has this government been involved in various meetings with Senator Colston and his staff to fabricate the documents that were placed before the Senate? These are matters that this government will not be able to run away from. Vote buying is a very serious business. It undermines the very basic premise of the democratic system in this country and you are guilty of it.</PARA>

The go ahead was for 3,000 hectares, and the report to the minister said that two areas of 1,000 hectares were pure calindendrous cathedral&hyphen;like rainforest. I did not mislead the Senate. In fact, the report on which the minister based his claims does not mention in its conclusions that these forests are degraded. It uses other adjectives, but it does not use that term. He was quite remiss in saying to the Senate that these forests are degraded when, in fact, they are floristically intact. There has been some very dispersed removal of logs in the past, but in fact it is calindendrous, intact, wild rainforest which he has licensed for destruction.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH></DEBATE>

Equally, if the Manager of Government Business in the Senate can think of a way through this which ceases this extraordinary embarrassment that Senator Ian Macdonald is to his colleagues and to the Senate, I am sure that you will find that the opposition and other senators will try to assist you and the good standing of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other brief point I wanted to make in relation to this matter is that it seems that Senator Carr and others are taking the word of Ms Christine Smith as being absolute gospel. I do not know Christine Smith at all. I have never met her and I do not know who she is. But it seems that she has given two versions of an event. The Labor Party are choosing one version and not the other.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society</EMPHASIS>  report, which was tabled out of session, as has just been stated. Reports come and go in this place, but some, it seems to me, deserve our particular consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is a seven&hyphen;year review of the adult and community education document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>, tabled in this place in 1991. That report put adult and community education on the political agenda. Indeed, I do not believe it will ever be removed from the political agenda, so I will not hold my breath on the capacities of this current government. We do not want it removed, and that is the unanimous report of people reviewing adult and community education six years after the first report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do note that the benefits of adult and community education continue and are now much better documented. The number of people using adult and community education is better counted. Although we really had no base data before 1991 that was very reliable, we can now say that, compared to 1991 when about 800,000 people used adult and community education, over a million people use it per annum. That is a remarkable marching with the feet, if you like, by the people in this country about what they think of ACE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important thing our report found was that, while ACE is a very good thing and people seriously want it, in the five or seven years that it has been in existence on the political agenda&mdash;it has been in existence much longer than that&mdash;there has been a skewing of adult and community education towards the vocational education and training end. The report documents that very nicely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What with the previous government's efforts to deal with unemployment and with the expansion of labour market programs,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there was available Commonwealth funding for vocational training and labour market programs. A lot of the adult and community education efforts were then directed towards that end, particularly as they could apply for, and very often were successful in gaining, Commonwealth funding to assist them in the delivery of those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble with that was that it seemed like adult and community education was becoming dominated by, even subsumed a little by, the vocational education and training end, and that the broader, more general education and more community delivered neighbourhood houses program of adult community education was being overlooked. This report says that that balance between adult and community education and the vocational end of adult education has to be put back into proportion. We ask the government to commit to the community or the ACE end and make it be able to stand alongside vocational education and training&mdash;not one subsuming the other, not one more important than the other, but both acknowledged as having a critical role to play and a critical appreciation by people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we make a very strong case for is that if government&mdash;any government&mdash;is taking up the adult and community education cudgel, it appreciates the importance of a commitment to lifelong learning. Our recommendations ask that the Commonwealth government, firstly, makes an unequivocal commitment to the concept of lifelong learning and to the promotion of a learning society; and, secondly, imbues its educational policies and associated funding mechanisms with the values and principles of lifelong learning for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sense in which adult and community education is seen as a bit of a mickey, as a bit of a soft cop at the top end of people's lives as they get older. That view completely misses the important contribution of the ACE sector in vocational education and training and the critical contribution it makes to any post&hyphen;school education. Adults who undertake this form of education do not have to be 55, 65 and 75 years of age. Adults are often people who, as 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, dropped
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2699"> out of school and later come back into the schooling system under the adult education umbrella because there they find that somehow it matches their needs better, they are treated as persons, they participate differently and now, suddenly, they are learning. It is about the whole teaching methodology and the teaching approach that, in some ways, I believe is a critical part of education. Indeed, we judge that it will be of great value to all education in this country, not just to what is called adult and community education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We suggest ways in which the adult and community education and the vocational education and training areas can be put together. We decided in the end that we would recommend that happen rather than try to come up with the perfect acronym. But it certainly seems a most important part of our recommendations and of our report that ACE and VET should stand side by side, not have one dominating or subsuming the other. We also suggest the restructuring of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, to include the ACE sector. This report recommends that, without terribly much expenditure or significant increase in outlays, that could be very effectively achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also argued the importance of some government funding for infrastructure for the community deliverers of adult education. It is not possible for people in neighbourhood houses or in community colleges to try to participate adequately if they do not have access to some infrastructure assistance, if they do not have a computer on which they may be able to take the data to report on how many people are using their service, to be able to make sure that, with any funding that they are successful with&mdash;sometimes they have been able to contribute to the vocational end and have achieved funding for that&mdash;they are able to properly document and account for that. They need infrastructure assistance at that level, and we make a recommendation about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also appreciate that the data that we have been able to get shows that in some sectors very large numbers of people participating in adult education are women. They are much more likely to be women who have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> already had access to education and are adding to that; whereas it is clearly documented now that there are sectors of the community&mdash;particularly people from the lower socioeconomic end of town&mdash;who do not go to or do not participate in or are not involved in adult and community education. We recommend that that be looked at very seriously and that an equity fund be established to assist some of those people who are grossly under represented to have access to that kind of assistance, particularly in any post school training or in bridging courses before they even get to vocational education and training. Along with this, of course, is needed continuing and adequate research, and we also make recommendations about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it to my colleagues to make more remarks about this report. I strongly recommend that if people want to get the sense of it and do not want to read the full report, they can read this overview or summary of the recommendations and the general outline of what our report found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I think is particularly interesting is the evidence that is emerging that if people have the opportunity to use their minds, to do the intellectual push&hyphen;ups each day, to participate in any kind of education&mdash;whatever they prefer&mdash;this contributes to them staying mentally alert and active. There are some measured suggestions that it may indeed prevent the onset of Alzheimer's or early senility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that so many Australians will be becoming older&mdash;by the year 2010 we expect a very significant increase in the aged population in Australia&mdash;anything that might assist with the community having people live out their lives participating and contributing and managing for themselves in their own homes is going to be not only something we would like for those people but also something of great economic benefit. This is highlighted in the report and I believe it deserves very serious examination by governments, particularly if you are looking at the long-term costs of people going into nursing homes and aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, adult and community education should not be seen as being only for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2700"> people over 75 or over 50. It is about an attitude or an approach to education that I believe should infuse all education. That is what this report recommends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I particularly thank the staff who have been involved with this report&mdash;the Secretary, Brenton Holmes; Mr Alistair Sands; Jan Connaughton; Pam Corrigan; Jan Willis; and, Diane Leak&mdash;for their splendid assistance in writing the report, in dealing with the submissions and in organising our public hearings in every capital city and some beyond capital cities. It has been a most fruitful report and I look forward to the government's response to our recommendations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee, I support the remarks that Senator Crowley has made. I draw to the Senate's attention that on this committee there are substantial political differences and, of course, substantial issues of debate. However, this is one area on which I think all senators who have a genuine interest in education and a commitment to the important role that it plays in the development of our nation are able to agree. This is essentially what this report puts before the Senate&mdash;the broad agreement of a range of senators who would normally disagree substantially on very significant matters of public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that I put to this government that there is a basis on which senators are recommending to this government that they take this report seriously and that they do more than just issue pious platitudes&mdash;that they actually put some serious money behind this initiative, which is long overdue in terms of real commitment from education authorities around Australia. In saying that, I would like to join with Senator Crowley in thanking the secretariat for the outstanding job that they have done in organising the report and organising the inquiry. The Senate has working for it a very good group of people in this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee which reported in 1991 on the adult and community education sector produced the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinder
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ella</EMPHASIS>, which has received critical acclaim throughout the education community. I think that internationally it has been recognised as a significant document about policy in what is often referred to as the fourth sector of the education and training industry. While the report highlighted the connections between the various sectors of this industry, I think in many respects it has not been fully understood within the realm of government. Therefore, our second report draws to the attention of the government practical ways in which it can undertake measures to improve the development of a total learning society in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next month, Commonwealth and state ministers are coming together in their regular forum. I understand that a paper will be presented to that conference by the Victorian employment and education minister, Dr Honeywood. This will provide an opportunity, a vehicle, for this government to take up these issues. I trust that the ministerial council will be able to look at this report and use it as the basis for its discussions, in addition to those matters that Dr Honeywood is going to put before the ministerial council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I trust that Dr Honeywood will have studied this report. I am sure that the officers in Victoria will be able to draw upon the advice and evidence put before the Senate committee to bring forward constructive contribution in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to Victoria and Victorian education, it is very rare for me to be able to say very much that is in fact positive. But in regard to adult and community education in Victoria, I think there is substantial work going on, which is very much a continuation of the programs that were initiated under the previous government in that state. It is one area which has managed to avoid the decimation faced by education in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adult and community education sector in Victoria, while lacking serious funding&mdash;essentially because it is not able to effectively tap into ANTA funding&mdash;has maintained nonetheless a philosophy and a program which I believe makes it a leader within this country in the provision of adult and community education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2701">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, of course, still very much work to be done in that area. In particular, I think adequate recognition has to be secured for the full range of education and training services provided through the adult and community education sector. There are many policies and structural changes which have made a big impact on the provision of those education services to the people of this country. In particular, the establishment of the national vocational education and training system, which has been funded through ANTA, has provided a vehicle for additional funding to the various providers of adult and community education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue here is that there has been an extension of adult and community education as a result of additional moneys that have been made available by the Commonwealth. The real problem is that, while a more diverse group of people has been able to be introduced to education after they have left school&mdash;often they are persons who have missed out on really rewarding experiences through the education system&mdash;the provision of adult and community education, as if it was a labour market program alone, is not sufficient to meet the full educational needs of the adult and community education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really very unfortunate that the description and definition of VET funding is such that it actually excludes general educational provision, which is of great detriment to the adult and community education sector. Despite the commitments that have been made by the national VET strategy&mdash;the so-called commitment to lifelong learning and the acknowledgments that governments have made of the contribution of general adult education to adult and community education&mdash;there remains this major deficiency in that there has not been provided to ANTA funding for general educational purposes to adults outside the formal education system as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we clearly see on the evidence that has been made available to us is that there are now nearly one million persons who are involved in adult and community education. There is a much broader array of people involved in that sector than there has been at
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any time in the history of this country. Yet they are not all able to secure access to reasonable sources of funding. Particularly, there is a bias towards particular groups of people in this country. In fact, a great disadvantage is being experienced, particularly by working class men, as a result of the failure of governments to meet the needs of all Australians in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I see it, there are two real difficulties here. I draw your attention to the difficulties that are faced by the non&hyphen;participation of so many people, particularly those most disadvantaged in our society and who have been so disenfranchised in terms of their access to real power, real authority and real wealth in this country. Not only working men but also persons with disabilities and people who are from Aboriginal and Torres Strait backgrounds are particularly disadvantaged in this sector, as they are in every other sector of the education industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we as a parliament need to do, therefore, is to keep pressure on this government to ensure that ACE providers are provided with additional resources and that the ministers and government officials in the education departments across this country are made aware of and recognise the contribution of adult and community education to lifelong learning in our society. At a time when there is growing evidence of people being disorientated and alienated from the social structures of our community, this area of education provides a real opportunity for ordinary people to participate as community members and to improve their skills in a real and effective way, so that they can join in their society in a more effective manner and contribute fully to it. In this way, it is serving not just a narrow vocational purpose but a genuine social purpose as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, the government has an obligation to broaden its descriptions of adult and community education programs and to see that genuine community activists in the education field are able to attract people&mdash;particularly those who have had a bad experience in the formal institutional settings of education in this country&mdash;to ensure that there is lifelong learning and that it is possible for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2702"> people to maximise their full potential by being able to enjoy the benefits of learning, mixing with other people and seeking out new information and knowledge about the way in which our society works. This parliament has a responsibility to ensure that ministers from all governments around this country&mdash;and all officials in all departments throughout this country&mdash;understand that adult and community education is an important part of the education environment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, presented to the President yesterday, deals with the role and future of Radio Australia and Australia Television. I stand here today able to say that, as a result of tremendous public response to the committee's inquiry, together with the public outcry that has taken place right across this nation and in countries around the region, we still have Radio Australia. However, the Radio Australia we are going to have in the future is going to be a far cry from the one we had until the recent decisions of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report, representing the opposition senators and the Democrats, of the Senate committee strongly supports a continuing role for the ABC in international broadcasting and, in particular, strongly supports the retention of Radio Australia and Australia Television. It calls upon the government to rethink its position and its attitude, to drop its ideological obsession with slashing the budget of the ABC and to commit appropriate funds, in accordance with their pre&hyphen;election commitments to maintain Radio Australia and Australia Television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition&mdash;and in particular this Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston)&mdash;has made an art form out of breaking promises. There are many areas where we see that occurring daily. Amongst
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the clearest examples are its breaches of promises with respect to the ABC. This is a government that made statements prior to the last election&mdash;and, indeed, the minister made a statement on the night of the election&mdash;saying that ABC funding would not be cut. Yet what happened after the election? Fifty&hyphen;five million dollars was slashed out of the ABC's funding. This is a government that promised it would maintain Radio Australia: it recognised its great importance to the nation's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that said it would continue the commitment of the previous government to the funding package for Australia Television over the course of the next three years; yet we now have a situation where ATV is to be sold off or, if it is not sold off, it could well be closed down next month, if Mr Mansfield's recommendations were to be adopted. We have a position where Radio Australia has had approximately two&hyphen;thirds of its funding removed. The fact that it will still receive funding in the order of $8 million&mdash;as compared with the $23&hyphen;odd million it relied upon previously&mdash;is not due in any part to some recognition by the government that it got it wrong; it is due to the public pressure that has been applied to this government to get it to rethink at least part of its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government and this minister set up the Mansfield review with the clear intention of stripping back and nobbling the ABC. In the words of the minister's own options paper, presented to the budget last year, they foresaw the future of the ABC as a very narrow, domestic broadcasting only operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have this ideological obsession to kill off the ABC. They have not got the courage to bring legislation into this chamber or into the other House which seeks to change the charter of the ABC, which is really what they would like to do. What they have set out on is a course to strangle them of funds. They would then say to the ABC, `You have to decide whether you will put the scarce resources that you will have in the future into domestic broadcasting or into international broadcasting.' It is a classic Pontius Pilate approach&mdash;slash the funding and then leave
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2703"> it to someone else to have to make the hard decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has absolutely no understanding, it would appear, of the importance of international broadcasting. Throughout the entire period that the inquiry has been under way and since the Mansfield review report came down in January this year, which led to the establishment of this Senate inquiry, the minister has made misleading statement after misleading statement. First of all, he said in an interview on 28 February, after this committee of inquiry had been established:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think Mansfield's made a pretty powerful case. There's been a lot of emotive reaction to it but I haven't seen any sort of in&hyphen;depth analysis that demonstrates either the effectiveness of the service or a significant demand for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he is talking here about Radio Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may well be that evidence, but you would have expected it to have been put before Mansfield, and it wasn't, and Radio Australia has obviously had every opportunity to mount their case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said that Mr Mansfield had actually looked at this and that Radio Australia had an opportunity to put their views to the Mansfield review. That is completely untrue. Mr Mansfield in his own report said that his terms of reference did not include consideration of the foreign affairs implications of closing down Radio Australia or ATV. In his own report he said that the government needed more information on these issues and that he did not have the terms of reference or indeed the time to consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that he had not seen any sort of in&hyphen;depth analysis. That is true because Mr Mansfield had not done it. The minister claims that Radio Australia had an opportunity to put its case. They did not. Two days prior to the interview with the minister&mdash;you wonder what the minister was actually doing and why he had not brought himself up to date&mdash;Mr Mansfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you look at my terms of reference, I only had to look at the ABC. I didn't have the task and wasn't asked to look at Australia's foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just didn't have the instruction to take into account the foreign affairs implications.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having put that misleading comment to bed, the minister then changed tack. He claimed that short&hyphen;wave radio is really a declining technology and Radio Australia really should be done away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the committee inquiry shows&mdash;and my colleague Senator Hogg will come more specifically to much of the evidence and detail put before the committee overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of RA and ATV; only one of over 2,200 submissions really was opposed to RA&mdash;major broadcasters like the BBC, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, Radio France, China Radio, Radio Japan and Voice of Vietnam are increasing their investment in short&hyphen;wave technology. What does this minister say? He says, `It's dead. Forget it, it's history.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also tried to put the view, as other members of the government have, that Radio Australia and ATV do not serve any purpose. Fortunately, it appears that there are some people on the government side who take a different view. One of those is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer. We know that Mr Downer wrote a letter to Senator Alston in February pointing out the positive advantages of Radio Australia to our foreign policy interests and the fact that it should continue and that funding should not be cut. It is a pity, however, that Minister Downer did not ensure that his own department made submissions to that effect when they came before the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a thorough, most extensive report. I urge all members of parliament to read it because it lays out fully the history and the role of Radio Australia and ATV and all of the foreign policy, trade and other reasons as to why it should continue. In conclusion, I especially thank Mr Paul Barsdell, the secretary of the committee, and Ms Loes Baker, who worked extremely hard up to last Friday even though she is expecting a baby next week. She worked right up until last week to finish the report. I also thank the other members of the secretariat for their hard work and long hours on this most valuable report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I learnt a great deal, which I did not already know, about Radio Australia and ATV while we were taking evidence and looking at all the submissions. I did not look at all of the 2,200 submissions, but I did look at quite a few of them. As Senator Forshaw has said, all but three of those submissions said that Radio Australia and Australia Television should be at least maintained. There was really only one submission out of the more than 2,200 that was against Radio Australia being maintained in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What were the arguments given against Radio Australia and ATV? There were really only two. The first argument is that it is too expensive to maintain these two services. That seems to be the general throwaway line that is used. Is it too expensive? When you look at the net cost to the country of ATV you find that it is about $2.34 million a year. That is when you take out the advertising. I wish there was not advertising on it. I voted against there being advertising on it and still wish there was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the situation as it is now, we do have advertising and that advertising pays for a lot of what is on ATV. The net cost to the country of ATV is about $2 million. When you look at that in the context of the entire budget it is absolutely so minuscule as to be absolutely ridiculous when you consider the good that this television service does us, especially in Asia, the Pacific and including North America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in North America recently and the point was made to me that Australia had gained a great deal of credibility in business in North America because ATV showed that we can do business in South&hyphen;East Asia. People were coming to the ABC in North America asking how we went about it. We had gained an immense amount of credibility in North America with ATV. We gained an immense amount of credibility in South&hyphen;East Asia and the Pacific particularly in what are called the A and B demographics&mdash;that is, the people who are the real decision makers in South&hyphen;East Asia and in the Pacific. They do look at ATV and they do take notice because
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they realise that it is unbiased news and fair and reasonable news. Obviously the cost is nowhere near too expensive. It is a ridiculous argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now decided to privatise ATV. I cannot understand this. The good that it does us is so immense. It is the most ridiculous decision. It is just unbelievable. Equally, is Radio Australia too expensive? It costs about $20 million when you include the transmission costs. For the good that that does and the influence that that gives us in South&hyphen;East Asia and in the Pacific region in particular, but also in Europe and North America it is not too expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was in North America two weeks ago people from the United Nations, from human rights organisations based in the Hague, from the United States Congress, from their international relations committee were asking me&mdash;I did not raise the question myself&mdash;why on earth Australia was deciding to close down or cut back Radio Australia. They could not believe it. It would be so silly. Nobody can believe it. I cannot believe it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot believe it. Why on earth would we, for the cost of $20 million, which is really very small in relation to the rest of the budget, give up the influence that that gives us? It is unbiased news, it is fair and reasonable and it is in other people's languages, not just our own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we have the foreign language services, the non-English services, demonstrates that we have a commitment to this region, that we have a commitment to South&hyphen;East Asia and to the Pacific. If we get rid of any of those foreign language services then that demonstrates the very clear message that we are cutting back on our commitment to this region, that we are cutting back on our commitment to anything other than English. That is not a clear message we want to be giving at the moment. It is just ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument against Radio Australia and ATV, particularly Radio Australia&mdash;and I think one person out of those 2,200 submissions gave this argument&mdash;was that the Australian national broadcaster does not have the right to broadcast a point of view which is not that of the government of the country
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2705"> to which that broadcast reaches. I think that is an absolutely and totally outrageous thing to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anybody who has read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, who has read the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, who has read the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights say that people in a country other than our own do not have the right to hear what somebody other than their own government has to say? Does that mean that he believes that to Burma we should only be broadcasting what the SLORC says or we should only be broadcasting what Aung San Suu Kyi says? She is the elected leader but she is not the actual leader; the actual leaders are the SLORC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It follows of course that the ABC, being the Australian national broadcaster should not broadcast anything but what the government says. It follows that anything that the Labor Party, the Democrats or the Greens or anybody else says should be anathema to be broadcast by the ABC. We would not agree to that. Nobody would agree to that. It is the most outrageous statement. How on earth anybody can make that statement in relation to overseas broadcasting I cannot understand. Obviously that is not an argument either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, there are no arguments that can be put that would get rid of Radio Australia and ATV, for the influence that it gives us, for the good that it gives us. It is in the national interest that we not only maintain Radio Australia and ATV at the level at which they now are but that we increase them, that we increase the foreign language capacity of both of these organisations and that we make sure that they grow, not that they shrink. It is an absolutely ridiculous argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overseas reaction to this has just been incredible and absolutely massive. There has been reaction from Asia. We have all seen the reactions from Malaysia, Indonesia and from places we would not have expected. People have said in newspapers mostly that Radio Australia in particular and ATV have to be kept on. It is just silly and ridiculous for the government to cut back on them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the Pacific. Sir Julius Chan while he was still Prime Minister of PNG said that he would give us back $1 million of our aid to Papua New Guinea in order to keep it going because it was such an important service to Papua New Guinea. I am very pleased to see that the government has decided that the Tok Pisin service is to remain. That is good but what about the other services? What about the Cantonese service? That is going to go. Do we have no interest in people from south-east China? Is that why the Cantonese service is going or do we think they should all just learn English and then they will understand what Radio Australia has to say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction from the USA has been large. One of the rumours going around Washington at the moment, that I was told about when I was there, is that the reason we are cutting back on it is that the government has been pressured by the Chinese government into getting rid of or cutting down on Radio Australia in particular. I hope that is not true. It is certainly a rumour that is going around Washington DC. If it is not true it ought to be scotched by our government immediately. The easy way to scotch it, of course, is to fund Radio Australia and ATV to the current levels. Increasing that funding would be even better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you one quote that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> on 3 May. It is from Mr Bruce Gale of the Hong Kong organisation, Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the Australian government does now, it is too late. (Pauline Hanson) and the closing of Radio Australia seem to show Australia turning in on itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not too late. I do not believe it is too late. We had heard, as Senator Forshaw told us, that Radio Australia would be cut down to a service of $2 million to $3 million in English only and via satellite. The human rights implications of that are so gross and horrendous it is just not worth thinking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these people who live in the backblocks of Indonesia, who live in Burma, who live in places that do not get reasonable, unbiased news from their own news services&mdash;and they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2706"> know that&mdash;listen to Radio Australia to find out what is actually going on in their own country and in the region. This is an absolutely basic service. Radio Australia and ATV&mdash;particularly Radio Australia over short wave&mdash;are the only services that will give these people news about what is going on in their own region. But it is not too late. The position has been expanded from where it was. We have gone up from that $2 million figure and we can keep going up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole basis, however, of this downgrading, this destruction, this abandonment of RA and ATV, is the vicious cuts to the funding of the ABC. That is something that we all have to look at. We all have to make sure that there are no more vicious cuts; in fact, that those vicious cuts are reversed, that the ABC is funded properly and that the ABC is given a reasonable amount of money to do its job both domestically, within Australia, and internationally.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2706" TIME="5.00 p.m." SPEAKER="Troeth, Sen Judith" NAMEID="GX5" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, I presented the President with the minority report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which made several recommendations about the future of Radio Australia and ATV. But it is important to realise that the groundwork for the cuts that have been made to Radio Australia, and, indeed, to the funding of the ABC, started with the financial situation that the present government inherited when it gained government in March last year and we faced an $8 billion financial black hole. The ABC, in common with many other government departments and government authorities, simply had to take its share of the cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ABC has to look at an overall cut in its funding and it has to choose between international broadcasting and cuts to domestic services, I know what I would be choosing. It is very important to remember that it is the ABC itself which decides where its priorities lie. If I were in charge of the ABC and looking at making cuts to rural and regional broadcasting to people in Australia or international broadcasting, I know what I would choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it is very important to realise that it is the management of the ABC which
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chooses to make those cuts and the management of the ABC which sets down where the funding lies. I clarified that in my exchange with Mr Johns during the committee hearings, when I said to him that any decision to close Radio Australia would be made by the board. Mr Johns's response was, `Yes, absolutely.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to realise also that, of the many letters that were written to Radio Australia about the reasons why people listened to it, everyone believed in principle&mdash;that is, those who wrote from overseas as to why Radio Australia should not be cut&mdash;that it should not be cut. But among the percentage of answers which gave specific reasons as to the value of Radio Australia were the following responses: from the China section, 18 per cent stated that Radio Australia promoted trade, tourism and study connections and 13 per cent of those Chinese letters said that Radio Australia was a valuable ambassador.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eleven per cent of the letters received from the Indonesian section said that Radio Australia promoted trade, tourism and study connections, and nine per cent mentioned the ambassadorial role. Only 15 per cent of the total responses which have been processed and categorised by Radio Australia said that Radio Australia is an ambassador for Australia; 13 per cent said that Radio Australia promoted trade, tourism and study involvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ABC board has to prioritise its funding levels, I would expect that it would target the international broadcasting market in those areas which are going to promote trade, tourism and an increase in the way in which we engage with Asia. Certainly that is something which they will have to consider. We should target our market a lot better, and we should make sure that we reach the decision makers in Asia who are going to influence our trade, tourism and educational roles. The way to target the decision makers is to engage them in a variety of mediums&mdash;not just Radio Australia, but also ATV, which has been set, I presume, on a successful sale path. There have been many expressions of interest in ATV, and I would expect that, after the end of June, ATV will go on to pursue the very
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2707"> active entrepreneurial role for Australia which it has assumed so far during its very short existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to target Asia at a variety of levels, and it is not just Radio Australia which is going to provide that in the future. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides a valuable service by the dissemination of information through its posts. The private sector plays an increasingly valuable role in sending out our trade, ambassadorial and educational messages, and all the other messages which we need to send out through Asia. As I said, the use of ATV is something which could be expanded almost to an unlimited point in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry was basically set up as a political stunt. It was given a time frame of three months&mdash;between February and the start of May&mdash;and there is no way that a reporting date one week before the budget could possibly hope to influence the budget process. I was rather disappointed that in spite of much of the valuable work done by the Mansfield report, the opposition chose to denigrate that report as something that had made no contribution whatever to this debate. I would prefer to believe the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, in the decisions that have been made both by the government, in keeping some of the language services, and by the ABC board to keep the Indonesian service, I believe that we have recognised the essential components of Radio Australia and the areas of Radio Australia where we should be putting our efforts in the future. Therefore, I commend the minority report to the Senate and I look forward to further actions by the government to consolidate our efforts in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I would like to say in speaking to this report is that it is not a political stunt by the opposition. It was brought about by the fact that the government, for their own perverse reasons, were going to axe Radio Australia and sell off ATV. That was purely an economic rationalist decision. There is no doubt, as Senator Bourne said here earlier, that the money was there to keep both ATV and Radio Australia alive, because
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they both serve a valuable purpose for our neighbours in Asia and the Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one thinks we are alone in servicing those areas, one only needs to look at chapter 8 of the report where well-known broadcasters in that region are listed, and it is interesting to look at a few of them. The BBC World Service broadcasts in 12 regional languages; Voice of America, 12 regional languages; Deutsche Welle, six regional languages; Voice of Russia, nine regional languages; Radio France International, five regional languages; and Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran, seven regional languages&mdash;and so the list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are doing in the Asian region and the South Pacific is nothing unusual. There are many both independent and national broadcasters beaming into that part of the world to put their point of view or at least to have their point of view heard by the people with whom they are going to deal. That is the burgeoning market for the Australian nation&mdash;that South-East Asian region&mdash;and we cannot ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what this government is attempting to do by reducing the service of Radio Australia and by selling ATV is to reduce our direct influence in that part of the world. I think that is a completely reprehensible move on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn in particular to some of the remarks made by my colleague Senator Forshaw. Senator Forshaw made it quite clear that the Mansfield report did not in any way address the issue of foreign broadcasting&mdash;in particular, with Radio Australia and Australia Television. So that completely dispels what the government have said in their minority report and what has been put to this chamber today by Senator Troeth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there is a real role and a real part to be played by both Radio Australia and Australia Television as independent broadcasters&mdash;and this is the important thing. They are independent broadcasters, as opposed to some of the other broadcasters who broadcast into the Asian and South-East Asian region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2708">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia and ATV&mdash;even though Australia Television has only been going for a short time&mdash;have gained a lot of respect and have gained a lot of loyal listeners or viewers, whichever the case may be. They are quite essential to many people throughout this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures that Senator Troeth was quoting before may serve her purpose well, but they do not represent the overwhelming evidence that was given to the committee when it was taking evidence in the various states of Australia. So there is no doubt that what we are seeing is the axing or the diminution in the role of a vital&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What an extraordinary cop-out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Howard government this letter back to the Senate is. On 10 December last, the Senate adopted my motion which called on the Howard government to follow suit with the Clinton Administration and the Congress of the United States in legislating to ensure that trade contacts with Burma were terminated. The terms of the American resolution stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government of Burma has physically harmed, rearrested for political acts, or exiled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi or has committed large&hyphen;scale repression of or violence against the Democratic opposition.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2709">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since that time&mdash;in fact, just two weeks ago&mdash;reacting to continuing repression of democracy and the people in general by the SLORC military government in Burma, President Clinton decreed and brought into law that there shall be no further investment by United States entities, persons or corporations in this military dictatorial country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government and the minister here are well aware of what the SLORC government in Burma has done. Firstly, it has totally corrupted democracy by refusing to accept that Suu Kyi is the properly elected head of state. She was elected in proper democratic elections by the people of Burma, but instead of being the elected head in Burma, she is under house arrest and her life is increasingly in danger. Beyond that, many people who support her or who have otherwise given expression to their feelings in Burma are in gaol and are being or have been tortured or killed&mdash;that is thousands of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reports coming back from all over that country are that this is one of the most abominable repressions by a government of its own people anywhere in the world today. We read about villagers who are being shot and people who are being raped. Adults and children are indiscriminately being grabbed from their villages. They are being abducted on walks between villages and taken off to slave camps where they are working for nothing under deplorable conditions which no self&hyphen;respecting government in the world would allow&mdash;degrading conditions which are not dissimilar to those which we have seen under military occupation of foreign countries by reprehensible dictatorships in the past. This is a country enslaved. This is a country where the abrogation of democracy and rights is standard. But this is a country which this Australian government is giving succour to by its failure to take stronger measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate was quite right in passing the motion; the government is terribly wrong in essentially thumbing its nose at that motion. It is noticeable in this letter from Alexander Downer&mdash;which, by the way, has taken some five months to come back to us&mdash;that he does not even recognise Suu Kyi as a democratically elected head of state. He tries to get out of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia doing anything about the SLORC regime in Burma by saying that Australia accounts for less than one per cent of total foreign investment in Burma and that our trade in or out of that country accounts for less than one per cent of international trade, and therefore sanctions on Burma are going to have very little real effect. That is an inverse argument if ever I heard one. The argument is usually the pain that will be brought on the country levying the sanctions. What Alexander Downer is saying in this letter is that there will be very little pain indeed to the Australian business community, and to this country as a whole, if we follow suit with the United States. He may have a stronger argument&mdash;in fact governments traditionally do have a stronger argument&mdash;if there is more at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same Howard government, let us remember, that refuses to bring Tibet into mainstream debate when there are meetings between heads of government in China and Australia, because of the increasing trade connections and advantages that the government sees for Australian businesses investing in China. Without expostulating on this, the real reason is that it is dollars before people, and it is mounting billions of dollars that are involved in that trade. And this is the strongest argument this government has for turning a blind eye to what is happening in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they turn that argument right around. The minister turns that argument completely on its head when it comes to Burma. He is saying that, because less than one per cent of Burmese trade and investment comes from Australia, we are not going to levy the same sort of embargo that the United States has just levied. It is cowardly, it is thoughtless, it is irresponsible, and it is an embarrassment to have this country, which holds democratic principles and liberty and life at such high levels, represented by a government that cannot even rise to the occasion in following suit with the United States in a very limited action to try and bring some pressure to bear on the SLORC military government in Burma.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment of this debate, I was raising with Senator Kemp the importance of having all of the information available prior to our deciding on this particular issue, or even prior to expressing a concluded view on this particular issue. Here, of course, we are talking about the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997 and, as we all know, the Treasurer had the Commonwealth Actuary head a committee to report on the implementation of the scheme that the government has. I had asked Senator Kemp to table that document because I think it will be an extremely revealing document if it is tabled. I see that Senator Kemp is not, as yet, in the chamber. We have the Manager of Government Business in the Senate in the chamber and I am wondering whether he could let the Senate know whether that document, namely the report of the Actuary, is available to be tabled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From what I can gather, there are a number of matters in the Actuary's report which would be of great interest to the chamber, not only to members of the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens, but also to government members.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important because it goes to the advice the government has received about defined benefits funds in particular and we will get to that issue a little later. There are some other issues that I do want to take up with Senator Kemp in the context of this debate and, as I said, Senator Kemp, yes, the opposition would certainly like to see a copy of the actuarial report. Perhaps if I stop at this stage, you can respond and then we will continue on with some other matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this time in the committee stage of the superannuation bills to ask the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) whether he could listen to these particular matters that have been raised and give a response on them, particularly in respect of defined benefit schemes. Whilst I acknowledge that these particular matters that I am about to raise are not specifically related to the amendment that is before us, this amendment and the fact that we are in the committee stage anyhow have enabled a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2721"> number of questions to be asked of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to raise a number of matters now. I ask the minister for his response, particularly relating to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. We have had a number of representations about it. Of course, it is a defined benefit scheme. The employer does not make contributions during the life of the scheme but pays a defined benefit. In the case of public servants, it is usually a pension on the retirement of the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed 15 per cent surcharge contained in this legislation requires that a notional employer contribution is actuarially assessed each year in order to calculate the amount of the surcharge owing for that year. The surcharge amounts assessed each year accumulate until the member retires or leaves the fund. Interest is charged on the accumulating amount each year at the 10&hyphen;year Treasury bond rate, which is currently almost eight per cent. The final amount owing is paid by commuting the pension otherwise payable, deducting the amount owing and then recommuting the remainder into a reduced pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net result of this approach is that after the first year the effective surcharge rate will be more than 15 per cent because of the effect of interest charged on the amount. The total owing will increase rapidly because of the compounding effect of the interest charges. In one scenario, a public servant with 15 years service would pay half as much again in interest charges than he or she would if he or she were able to arrange for the surcharge amount to be paid annually as it fell due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not a fact that the legislation discriminates against members of defined benefit funds in at least three areas? It will not permit defined benefit funds to pay the surcharge amount owing annually as it falls due. The surcharge is to be based on a notional employer contribution to be actuarially calculated each year. The eventual loss to a member of a defined benefit fund when that member retires or leaves the fund, in respect of the extent of the reduction in the member's final benefit, usually a pension, will again depend
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on an actuarially calculated variable&mdash;namely, the commutation rate to be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These three factors result in discrimination between members of defined benefit schemes, such as the Commonwealth's superannuation scheme, and members of accumulation schemes, which is of interest to all of us, such as the PSS. Because the actuarial products will presumably be averaged to apply to a particular scheme, the last two factors that I mentioned will also result in discrimination between members within a defined benefit scheme in that they are notional calculations which do not take into account individual members' circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the first factor that I mentioned, members of accumulation schemes will be able to pay their surcharge amount annually thus avoiding interest. In accumulation schemes such as the PSS, members will also be able to increase their contributions within defined limits and in defined circumstances and in so doing will be able to increase the amount of their employer's contributions thus offsetting to an extent the reduction in final benefits which would otherwise apply. I believe this is important for us because we have some responsibility in that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of accumulation schemes also have the benefit of receiving interest on their employer's contribution each year. As there are no regular employer contributions in defined benefits schemes, these options are not open to members of such schemes&mdash;and here I particularly refer to the Commonwealth Public Service scheme&mdash;who will suffer the additional inequality of being forced to pay compound interest on the accumulating notional amount of surcharge plus interest. Members of defined benefit schemes will usually have planned their retirement on the basis of expected final salary level and a percentage of that salary will be paid as a pension. The surcharge which is contained in this legislation will effectively reduce the final pension payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask honourable senators whether that is fair and just and whether it amounts to the Commonwealth taking a decision which in effect repudiates the employment contract into
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2722"> which these public servants entered many years ago. I ask the minister if he would like to comment on the matters that I have raised because I think as the employer of public servants the government does have a responsibility to those public servants who are members of defined benefit schemes and who will be discriminated against by this legislation as I have just indicated.</PARA></SPEECH>

What we are seeking is to ensure that people are treated in an equitable fashion. Some would argue that people in defined benefit funds are advantaged by the payment deferral. I think economists would say that, depending on the rate of interest, if there is no interest it often is an advantage to defer a payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a spate of articles initially when this scheme was announced. My memory, and I think it serves me correctly, is that there was a feeling that people in defined benefit schemes such as the ones you are referring to would be advantaged. The idea is to prevent unfunded defined benefit schemes being advantaged by payment deferral. The notion is, if you have to pay the same amount now or you have to pay it later, it may well be an advantage to pay it later. Scheme administrators will be required to maintain accumulation accounts of relevant members linked to a prescribed interest rate to maintain its value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking is not to advantage one particular fund compared with another type of fund. What we are seeking to do is treat all arrangements in an equitable fashion. That is why there is a prescribed rate of interest. That is why there is the development of a notional surcharge contribution. As I said, we believe that what we are doing is treating funds in an equitable fashion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a feeling initially in some of the debate that the ability to defer payment, as in the defined benefit schemes, would be seen to be an advantage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, let me assure you the government does not seek to advantage one particular group over another. It does not seek to advantage one particular scheme compared with other schemes. The arrangements I think are best summarised in the press release of 15 February, which looks in some detail at the contribution rates for defined benefit funds and unfunded defined benefit schemes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister might assist us by telling us who is actually going to benefit from the difference between bond rates and normal bank rates, whose hand will be in whose pocket and what will happen with that. Also, the minister indicated that there has been a great deal of consultation. I wonder how much notice the government has actually taken of the consultation. I have just seen a press release from the Institute of Actuaries of Australia in which they have indicated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain of the view that the government's preferred course of action is not a good one. The institute has drawn the government's attention to a number of problems with the current superannuation surcharge, including the complicated and expensive method of collection, the likely inequities for individuals because of averaging, the difficulty of calculating the surcharge for defined benefit funds and different treatments for defined contribution and defined benefit funds and possible tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That probably supports what has been said by Senator Sherry and me in relation to the complexities. Are you suggesting the actuaries are all wrong here and it is not complex at all?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not suggest that there are not issues here which are issues
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which have a degree of complexity but I think there is a tendency in this whole debate to overstate in a number of areas the complexity which is involved. The complexity for the collection has been raised as being somehow incredibly complex although much of it involves exactly what funds do in the normal course of business. What funds have to do is supply the tax office with a person's name, contributions and tax file number. There is nothing hugely complex about that. The tax office has then got to match it up with income and, where required, send back a debit to the fund. That is not hugely complex.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there have been a lot of attempts to try to prevent the introduction of a measure which, after all, is about equity. I think the Greens support the 15 per cent. The Labor Party supports the 15 per cent&mdash;or do they? Time will tell. But they did support it. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has indicated he has done a complete backflip. They indicated they would support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are issues which involve a degree of complexity but I think there has been a bit of a tendency amongst some groups to overstate the complexity involved. I have given a summary regarding the collection. The Institute of Actuaries gave some emphasis to this issue in the statement which Senator Margetts read. Frankly, it is not as complex as other schemes which were put forward including, we think, the scheme which was put forward by ASFA. I do not want to diminish the fact that this involves some challenges, but to suggest that the collection device is hugely complex as far as the funds are concerned overstates the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the choice of the bond rate was raised. Senator Margetts, we should not always assume people do things out of mala fides or ill faith. The 10&hyphen;year Treasury bond rate was used as this rate reflects the interest on long&hyphen;term Commonwealth debt. It is seen as appropriate that long&hyphen;term debts due to the Commonwealth are subject to the same rate of interest as applies to long&hyphen;term debts owed by the Commonwealth. That is the rationale for the particular interest rate which was chosen. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two amendments deal with a very important issue for the Labor Party, namely, the issue of the non&hyphen;collection of surcharge tax revenue from low and middle income earners. This is one of the two sets of amendments that are critical to our support of the third reading of this legislation. It has been claimed, time and again, that the government wants to collect this revenue from high  income earners&mdash;those people earning more than $70,000. The income level is actually somewhat less than that, but we will not argue about that detail&mdash;it is an important side issue, but it is a side issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2727">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, despite the assurances Senator Kemp can give about the intensive campaign that will be waged by the tax office, that there will certainly be some people who will have to pay the surcharge who earn less than $70,000. The advice we receive from those we refer to as expert advisers and Senator Kemp refers to as vested interests is that there will be a very significant number of people earning less than $70,000 who will be required to pay the surcharge because of the non&hyphen;provision of tax file numbers&mdash;and we cannot find anyone who contradicts this. We have been given figures showing that enormous numbers of people will be hit by this collection of tax revenue from low and middle income earners. This is one of our fundamental concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The numbers we are given vary considerably. We have had figures ranging from a million to two million to 2&half; million. No one can give us an accurate figure but we are told constantly that it will be very substantial. We are told by all the experts that the number of low and middle income earners who will be hit by the surcharge and who should not be hit by it will exceed the number of people who should be taxed&mdash;those earning more than $70,000. That is what we are told by all the experts, and we cannot find anyone to contradict that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can argue or disagree about the number of low and middle income earners who will be hurt, but the government's continual assertion is that it is only after revenue from those people earning more than $70,000. Labor's fundamental principle on these two amendments is that, if there is tax assessable on low and middle income earners&mdash;as there will be&mdash;it should not be collected. That is the fundamental principle underlying the two amendments we are considering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the drafting of the collection mechanism, the superannuation surcharge bills&mdash;as they are currently drafted&mdash;do not fulfil the commitment that this legislation is aimed at taxing high income earners and not low and middle income earners. Labor will not accept a piece of legislation&mdash;or vote for it at the end of the day&mdash;if low and middle

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We fail to see why those people who are assessed as being low or middle income earners should have to pay one single dollar of tax that they should not have to pay. Why should the tax office go through the enormous cost of collecting tax that apparently at some later date is going to be refunded? The government said, `This money is refundable,' but why collect tax from 100,000 people, half a million people, one million people or two million people&mdash;from anyone, for that matter&mdash;who should not be paying a tax in the first place? As I said, it is the most significant shamble that we have seen in a long, long time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ferguson, I have regard for your intelligence and knowledge of the superannuation industry. You must know, I put it to you, through the committee hearings, through your contact with industry and, in fact, through people who have complained to you about this particular provision that there will be many people who will not put in their tax file number&mdash;many people will not realise the consequences of not putting in their tax file number. Why collect the money from them? It is a very fundamental and simple principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has told us time and time again that there is no money in the budget forward estimates from anyone earning less than $70,000. This is a revenue neutral amendment because the consequence of this is that it refuses to collect money from people who have less than $2,000 put into their superannuation accounts each year. It is revenue neutral&mdash;unless of course the government wants this money from low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a lot of money. We concede that. If these bills are not amended, there will be a lot of individuals affected and there will be a lot of money collected that should not be collected. It might be $50 million, it might be $100 million, it might be $200 million, it might be another $500 million. But if your intention is that it will only affect higher income earners, why should the money be collected from low and middle income earners because the funds do not have their tax file number? Exempt them, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that it was not easy to design these amendments. It was not easy to design these amendments because of the way you have gone about collecting this money through the funds. You have called it a surcharge&mdash;you have not called a tax a tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have continually asked the government, in estimates committees and on the floor of this chamber, to provide us with estimates on the amount of revenue that will be collected from people earning under $70,000. They will not give it. I know why they will not give any estimates. The figure would be a guesstimate, but it is certainly going to be a very, very sizeable sum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, you have continually told us that not one single dollar gained from low to middle income earners is calculated in that $1.5 billion that we talked about earlier and that all the money in the forward estimates will be raised from the high income earners&mdash;those earning more than $70,000 a year. If that is true, we would love to see you accept this revenue neutral amendment not to collect the money from those persons whose superannuation contributions are less than $2,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these amendments are carried as well as the Labor amendment in respect of what occurs to workers when they are made redundant, Labor is willing to support the third reading of this legislation. That is our commitment. But what has become obvious to us in this debate on the surcharge legislation during the seven months since the budget has been the continual problems with the legislation. I am not going to go into the details about the legal problems and the re&hyphen;writing&mdash;and we have dealt with the problem with the states&mdash;but there has been a series of continual problems in respect of this package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think even you, Senator Kemp, truly understood&mdash;and I have to say that I do not think some of my colleagues understood  either&mdash;the magnitude of the tax that would have been collected from low and middle
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2729"> income earners because of this tax file problem. It has certainly become much more apparent in recent months as a result of the debate and the very important evidence we received before the Senate committee on this very, very critical issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's position is very clear. If you want to tax people earning more than $70,000 a year, that is your budget measure, that gives you the revenue and that is what is in the forward estimates. Labor's position is clear. We are disappointed that the government has chosen to break its promise at the election about no increase in taxes or no new taxes, but this is an increase and a new tax. You want the revenue for your budget bottom line. We accept that, so long as it is coming from those earning more than $70,000 a year. But not one dollar should be collected from low and middle income earners&mdash;not one cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the tax office go through this inordinately expensive process of collecting the money, holding it and having to refund it? I do not think a lot of people would seek a refund, regrettably, and why should you get more than the stated revenue that you put in your forward estimates when you claim this is a fair measure aimed at higher income earners and when lower and middle income earners are caught up in the tax net? It is grossly unfair that any lower and middle income earners should be caught up in the revenue net. Within the technical bounds of designing the amendments to this extraordinarily complex package of legislation that even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has conceded had some drafting problems, we do not want that money collected from lower and middle income earners. That is one of our two principled positions on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other amendments, Senator Kemp, which may not be passed. We are not going to be happy with that because we think they will improve the legislation. They are major amendments in their own way because they deal with somewhat smaller issues in the sense of the effect they have, but they are still important and I do not want to downgrade their importance. This to Labor is fundamental: no taxing of lower and middle income earners, no collection of the tax. I note&mdash;and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we will deal with an amendment later on&mdash;that where the tax is collected and it is refunded there will be no interest paid. That seems to us to be fundamentally unfair. We are talking here about a massive number of people who may be hit with a new tax. The critical thing is, this money is taken out of their fund by the fund trustees, passed on to the government, and these taxpayers, through no fault of their own, are losing interest on money that has been taken out. Why should they lose the accrued interest over that period? But we will get to that amendment later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would certainly like to see the government accept this amendment. It is intended to be revenue neutral and our drafting will reflect that. We would certainly appreciate any advice the government is willing to give us on that drafting. Goodness knows, we have been giving them enough advice in the last few months on the continual amendments that have had to be made to the government's legislation. It is our intention, based on the budget estimates, only including revenue from people earning more than $70,000 and not including one cent, Senator Kemp, from people who earn less than $70,000, that this will be a revenue neutral set of amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am assured that the comments I am making will be dealing with amendments Nos 7 and 47. Our amendment No. 47 is the definition of `adjustable taxable income'. Looking through our amendment, Senator, I have referred to ETPs, unpaid leave and like benefits that may be received, and that is clearly what our amendment No. 47 deals with in respect of adjustable taxable income.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Employee share benefits are covered by subclause (e).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe these payments should be caught within the definition for the following reasons. Firstly, they are once-off payments that are in keeping with industrial practices. They are not payments of a Bartels nature. These are payments that many of the 13,000 Telstra workers, for example, who will be made redundant will receive upon the cessation of their employment. Many of these people will not have any other form of income. Their superannuation is in fact their only security. We cannot accept that a government that is committed to a comfortable and relaxed Australia would seek to destabilise so many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition as currently drafted actually substantiates a leak that my office had in May 1996&mdash;that is, the government was seeking to impose a redundancy tax. That is our opinion of at least some of the effects of the government's current provisions. Interestingly, in our view, the bills as currently drafted attempt to achieve this end, at least in substantial part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also appalled by statements of government officials in the budget estimates. When asked if the surcharge tax would apply to ETPs, the officials answered that it would not and that the surcharge tax would only apply to those payments received on cessation of employment that were in excess of $70,000. I would note that we are not seeking to move an averaging definition. This should be seen as a sign of the opposition being reasonable in its approach on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those small business people who sell their business, farmers who sell their farms or receive payments for crops, artists who sell a piece of work or sports people who receive a contractual payment will all have to include these once&hyphen;off or irregular payments in their taxable income for that year. This may mean that these people will have to pay the surcharge or tax and, of course, the advance instalment that we talked about earlier. The opposition is taking the reasonable position of only requiring that eligible termination payments and receipt of unpaid leave are exclud
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2733"> ed from the definition of `adjustable taxable income'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to paragraph (d), we believe we are keeping the government honest. It seems that the government is going to have to rely on us to do so. The current definition of `adjustable taxable income', as defined by section 43, would catch all employee share schemes. We do not believe this should be the case&mdash;and that is certainly the advice we have had from a number of companies who are concerned about their employee share schemes being caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eligible termination payments surcharge bills impose a surcharge on eligible termination payments paid from employee share schemes. On budget night, the government announced that the superannuation surcharge would apply to golden handshake payments. There was no suggestion the surcharge would apply to ETPs paid from employee share schemes. It is considered that the application of a surcharge regime with effect from 20 August last year to such payments would be both offensive and harshly retrospective. It is the equivalent of imposing a surcharge on existing superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, we introduced new legislation dealing with employee share schemes. That legislation ensured that, in effect, shares allocated up to 30 June 1996 could continue to be paid as ETPs and would not be subject to the new taxation regime. In 1995, amendments were made to the reasonable benefits limit legislation ensuring that ETPs paid from employee share schemes were not subject to such benefit limits. It is interesting to note, Senator Kemp, that when you were in opposition you did support employee share schemes and, I understand, the legislation that we put before the Senate at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The termination payments surcharge bills represent an enormous blow to the efforts made by the employer to give employees a direct ownership stake in the enterprises in which they work, providing incentives&mdash;that is something you purport to do&mdash;to achieve high levels of productivity and excellence in the workplace. That last statement, the last couple of lines, was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself in a news
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> release dated 6 February 1996. We do find it strange that the government changes its position on this particular issue when it suits it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point the opposition would like to make regarding eligible termination payments is that they are already taxed. This would in fact be doubly taxing these benefits. In the case of those shares and employee share plans, they would be taxed three times if our amendment were not passed. Of course, this is a new tax measure, when the government promised there would be no increase in taxes or introduction of new taxes under the coalition government. We believe that you are blatantly breaking that commitment to the Australian electorate by the imposition of a surcharge tax, and now you plan to impose another tax on the new tax. This is completely in contradiction to your election statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind you again, Senator Kemp, that on 17 August your leader, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said that no worker would be worse off superannuation wise under a coalition government. Mind you, he also applied that promise in respect of some other matters, including the government co&hyphen;contribution. Because I am cognisant of the time, I will just refer to one specific question that we had raised with us late today; you might seek some advice from your advisers on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been contacted by members of the military&mdash;I did allude to this matter earlier&mdash;who receive retention bonuses in order to encourage them to stay in the armed services. They are claiming to us that, on their advice in reading the definition of taxable income, retention bonuses would be included within that definition. Consequently, when the retention bonus is collected by members of the military, many of them would pass over the $70,000 threshold. You may be able to confirm whether retention bonuses are included for military within the taxable income. We would be adding a further subclause (f) that retention bonuses paid to members of the armed services would also be omitted from the definition of adjustable income.</PARA></SPEECH>

Many senators, and those interested in this debate, would be aware that in the press release issued by the government in February, we made it absolutely clear that the definition of a golden handshake did not include bona fide redundancy and approved early retirement payments to the extent they are within the income tax exemption levels. In the number of debates I have had in the last 24 hours it became apparent that people did not appreciate that fact. I felt that some rather extreme and, to be quite frank, extravagant statements were made, which completely ignored that fundamental issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are, of course, within the income tax exemption limits. They were developed by the Labor government. They were what the Labor government&mdash;I think in July 1994&mdash;regarded as being fair and reasonable. Bona fide redundancy and approved early retirement payments have been exempt from income tax up to a limit which is indexed annually to average weekly ordinary time earnings. For the 1996&hyphen;97 year the income tax exemption limits are $4,348 plus $2,174 per year of completed service with the employee. These are generous and, as I said, they were developed by the Labor government. As I have said in this debate, I regret that a number of people had completely forgotten that bona fide redundancy payments within the income
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax exemption limits were excluded from the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry's amendment does a number of things which I think are unintended from his point of view, but we do not support them. We believe that the way he seeks to define adjusted taxable income leaves open avoidance using salary sacrifice packaging. It excludes capital gains and, of course, capital gains are often held by high income earners. We do not believe that is an equitable way to go. We believe that it would increase complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry raised the issue of employee share plans. This, I understand, is actually a matter of dispute. I am advised that payments from employee share schemes are not ETPs, following amendments concerning the tax treatment of employee share schemes in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has been some misunderstanding among some companies in respect of this particular issue. My advisers indicate that employee share plan benefits that arose after 1 July 1996 are included in assessable income under separate provisions in the income tax law. The amendment would exclude only a small number of employee share plan benefits from adjusted taxable income. Therefore, there is different treatment depending on when the benefits in the employee share plan arose. Senator, we heard your words on employee share schemes. As I have said, the issue seems to be more complex than has been indicated to you, certainly by some of the companies. We will not be supporting that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Democrats, after discussions with them, are going to be moving amendments. I understand that we could accept in those amendments super fund ETPs and unused leave on redundancy. So we are prepared to look at this issue once again. I do not think that that amendment is available yet. But, if my information and assumption are correct, and if your amendment when it appears is along the lines I have indicated, the government would support that. But we will not be supporting opposition amendments Nos 7 and 47 moved by Senator Sherry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding, from what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2735"> we have heard tonight, is that the ALP wants to ensure that certain areas are clearly excluded from the definition of `adjustable taxable income'. We think some exclusions are quite reasonable, but the new amendments seem to include some additional areas which I understand will have significance for some of the unfunded defined benefit schemes and for those receiving Commonwealth disability allowances. These areas are capital increases and insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are sympathetic with the intent. I wonder whether, if we exclude insurance from assessable income in order to help some legitimate Commonwealth employees who are not rorting the system and are not getting big salary substitutes, we will not just open up a new method for private industry to do salary sacrifice for executives. I think there might be such options in excluding insurance. I can imagine businesses offering to pay life, health, housing and car insurances for executives as part of a salary package. I would not like to see that untaxed or used as a tax minimisation mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to oppose amendment 7 as it stands, although we would be happy to look at alternative words to allow some of the Commonwealth invalid, disability or sickness items to be included as insurance to be excluded. We have a little concern with the net capital gains situation in subparagraph (d) of Senator Sherry's amendment 47 along the same lines. We have heard some elements of why it has been proposed. We would like to hear what potential there may be for the private sector to abuse the proposed amendment, to create minimisation schemes for high income earners. The indication that I have is that it would apply only to those people who are already on the higher level of income. So you are not looking at Mr and Mrs Joe Average who are part of a small business or a larger business and are engaged in employee share ownership. I think you are looking at people on executive salary packages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst that is not necessarily a bad thing, in my opinion there is no necessity to shield people on such high incomes from paying a fair amount of tax. If we were to support Senator Sherry's amendment 47, it would be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the basis of putting an amendment which would remove part (d) of that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this makes things almost hopelessly complicated. We are not able to support amendment 7 but we could support amendment 47 if (d) were removed. But, from where I am standing, it does not look like there are the numbers in the Senate to support it even if section (d) was removed. Perhaps Senator Sherry would like to respond.</PARA></SPEECH>

The great difficulty with this process is trying to define what are reasonable capital gains that should not be included in taxable income and what are unreasonable capital gains.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw subclause (d) in respect of net capital gains. The issues we have before us are as follows. With regard to insurance payments, we do not see this as a significant area of avoidance at all. There are many legitimate situations where a person receives an insurance payment in the event of invalidity and disability; we do not believe that should be included in the adjustable taxable income. We do not believe, on the advice we have received, that there would be any significant tax avoidance remodelling to pay people insurance payments in order to minimise tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By its definition, if there is a payment based on insurance it is subject to a whole range of tests about the validity of the insurance payment, depending on what the type of insurance is. We would hate to see people who receive an insurance payment, in the case of invalidity and disability, have that payment then included within adjustable taxable income. We would argue that the consequences of that are much worse than any possible tax avoidance, which we think, if it did occur, would be minimal. The difficulty it would cause for a number of people if insurance payments were not deleted from taxable income would be considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp said&mdash;I think, when I was listening to him&mdash;that insurance payments are not included. That is not our advice, Senator Kemp. We have had a number of people raise this issue with us. If it is not included there is no problem in you accepting (a).</PARA>

Many of them would have unpaid long service leave and unpaid annual leave and those could be substantial amounts of money. It could be many thousands of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we withdraw (d), net capital gains. Amendment No. 47, part (e)&mdash;and I apologise if I misled on a couple of points on (e)&mdash;goes to the employee share plans. Senator Kemp, you are advised that employee share plans are not included; that is not the advice that we have had. We have had one very major company contact us. They have been to their lawyers and they have carried out an exhaustive examination of the legislation. They still believe they are covered by the legislation. You accept they should not be but their advice to us is that they want assurance that employee share plans are not included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, with regard to (f)&mdash;I am not sure whether Senator Allison was listening when I was asking Senator Kemp about this&mdash;we had members of the military contact us about their retention bonuses, which are paid in order to keep members of the military in the armed services. Apparently, on Senator Kemp's advice, retention bonuses for members of the armed services are included in the definition of taxable income. I do not know whether Senator Kemp can make a quick decision on the run but I would have thought you would not want that sort of payment included in taxable income. I could not give you an estimate of the amount involved but it would be a relatively small number of people who would receive retention bonuses who would cross the threshold as a consequence of it being included. We think it is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2737"> unjust for members of the armed forces to have to pay&mdash;or perhaps have to pay, depending on the level of income&mdash;if their income is less than $70,000 but they trip over the $70,000 barrier because of their retention bonus in the armed services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to eligible termination payments, you are right, Senator Kemp, when you talk about bona fide redundancy payments being exempt. There is a definition of that; you have given it to us and we are aware of that. But there are a range of other payments that are made that may not be bona fide redundancy payments on termination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that, on redundancy, an employer is going to devise eligible termination payments outside the bona fide redundancy payments in order to boost the payments to employees to avoid the additional 15&mdash;or whatever the level of tax would be over $70,000. We think that there are many instances where there are quite reasonable eligible termination payments that are made. Why should they be caught in the superannuation surcharge tax net? So we will stick with (a), (b), (c), (e) and our new (f), which is the retention bonuses for members of the military.</PARA></SPEECH>

These concerns are around the issue of who is forced to pay the tax surcharge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It actually results, according to my advisers, in the threshold becoming $70,000 in year 2. The reason for this is because subsection (2) refers to the surcharge threshold which is stated to be $70,000 in subclause 9(1) of the bill. The amendment would require redrafting to correct this. So we certainly do not accept Senator Sherry's amendment. It is, by the advice I have, poorly drafted and leads to, as I said, some absurdities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that the minister has forgotten&mdash;and it is one of the most important principles in what we have been trying to debate here&mdash;is that the costs are not just corporate costs.

As I have indicated, there is no allowance in the figures produced in the budget for moneys collected from low and middle income people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stated on more than one occasion that not one low or middle income person need pay the surcharge. Of course, all that they have to do is supply their tax file number. Senator Sherry has raised some issues as to whether all will do so. Of course, there will be considerable efforts at collection to make sure that they do. The government is at one with all members of this chamber that we wish to ensure that low and middle income earners do not pay the surcharge. But it has to be done in a way which is administratively sensible, which does not provide perverse incentives, for example, for high income earners, by their own packaging arrangements, to avoid the surcharge.</PARA>

If the government is now accepting the principle that there will be an as yet undefined number of low and middle income earners who are going to be paying the surcharge because of non&hyphen;provision of tax file numbers, why on earth wasn't the legislation drafted in the first place to exclude those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2741"> people? Senator Kemp, what you have been saying month after month is, `It'll be all right. We're only going to tax the higher income earners&mdash;those earning more than $70,000.' Now you are admitting that that undefined number&mdash;and it will be very significant, in our view&mdash;would have had to have paid the surcharge, or the tax, if we had not acted in this chamber to force these amendments on you. That is what you are now admitting, Senator Kemp. It is a pity that the government did not listen to some commonsense about this problem when it started the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the committee that the great problem with all of this is that we have to go through what are extremely complex and convoluted amendments because the government would not call this a tax in the first place. It insisted on calling it a surcharge to avoid the accusation that it broke its election promise. So the government calls it a surcharge and gets the superannuation funds to collect it rather than collect it directly as a tax, as should have occurred in the first place. That is the fundamental reason why the government has had enormous problems with this over the last seven months since budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is incredible is that millions of people will have to be alerted to the tax file number problem. This will be at enormous cost to the tax office and to the funds. It is going to cost millions of dollars to collect tax file numbers and information that we do not want from 90 per cent of people&mdash;we do not want the information but we are going to collect it just the same. And now the government is finally conceding that, having collected this information as best we can, because you will not get it from everyone, we are not going to bother to collect the tax that we were going to hit them with in the first place. I have never seen such a shambles of a tax collection method in my six years in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, all these problems could have been averted if you had been honest and up&hyphen;front. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had said, `This is a tax,' and taxed people directly rather than indirectly through the funds and not tried to hide it, it would have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saved a lot of difficulty and angst on this particular measure seven months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have to look at the wording of the Democrat amendment, because I want to make sure, on behalf of the Labor Party, that it is effectively going to exempt from this tax everyone in receipt of below or around about average weekly earnings. We want to make damned sure that that is the case. As I said, we do not want one cent collected from low and middle income earners, because all the evidence on the government's current construction of these bills to date has been that there would have been at least a million subject to it.</PARA>

Tell me one fund that says it will not happen, Senator Kemp. You cannot. All you can say is, `Rubbish; we don't want to collect the money and we hope that everyone provides their tax file numbers.'

That is the sort of provision which should have been in the bills in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If only the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, knew a little more about superannuation and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, had not been so damn arrogant about this issue from budget night. He has been so arrogant. His approach to this package of bills has been, `We will accept no change. We will consult in name. We will pretend to consult, but we will ignore the fundamental problems of this legislation.'
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2742"> He has ignored all the criticism, ignored all the positive suggestions and just barged on regardless. His attitude has been, `If hundreds of thousands of lower and middle income earners in this country have got to pay tax who should not pay tax, let's just proceed. Let's just push these bills through the Senate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have it at 9 o'clock and the government is finally accepting that there is a problem. It is finally accepting the principal argument of not just Labor but the Greens, Senator Harradine and the Democrats that this issue has got to be solved so we can give some assurance to the lower and middle income earners, many of whom would have been slugged by this new surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just conclude my comments by saying that, despite this acceptance in principle by the government of this inevitable amendment that has been forced on it tonight to exclude lower and middle income earners, there is still enormous complexity. The irony is that we have to add complexity to complexity in order to delete lower and middle income earners and ensure they are not taxed by this new surcharge. That is the irony. The convoluted way the government is attempting to collect this revenue&mdash;by denying it is a tax and by getting the funds to do it&mdash;has led us to this enormously complex and difficult situation tonight, with an enormously complex, unwieldy and extraordinarily costly administration mechanism. Again, all the evidence is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, you cannot tell the Senate of one fund that believes the extra administrative cost to all the superannuation funds in the country to collect information&mdash;whether the cost is $10 million, $20 million or $100 million; there are a variety of claims, but I will accept the average of $40 million to $50 million&mdash;will not be borne by the eight million members when, in many of those funds, a very small proportion of the members earn more than $70,000. Unfortunately, this enormous administrative cost is still going to be passed on to all the members in the fund. It may be only 20c or 30c a week, but it is still a cost that erodes their long-term retirement benefit. It is an extraordinarily high cost
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of collection for half a billion dollars in revenue if we take those factors into account.</PARA>

The Labor Party, before the histrionics today, strongly supported the surcharge on high income earners. I could produce some quotes which would show that your leader supported that. You asked for a name and I gave you a name. It is not surprising that high income earners do not support with any enthusiasm the superannuation surcharge. I mean, gee whiz! That is hardly surprising. What is important for public policy reasons is whether the surcharge is an initiative which, at least up until today, Senator Sherry, when you started to backslide, was designed to ensure greater equity in the tax concessions which are available to high income earners and those available to low income earners. So raising your voice, indulging in histrionics and making wild claims,

It is interesting that every time we enter into a new debate about a new amendment the same outrageous accusations come forth from Senator Kemp that in some way the Labor Party have drafted poor amendments, when what we have seen from the government in this legislation is a case of not just policy on the hop but basically drafting of this legislation in the chamber and amendment by media.

So the inclusion of long service leave and annual leave, having been taxed&mdash;no complaint about that&mdash;can also boost your assessable income for the purposes of surcharge on superannuation payments made in that year. We claim it is a double tax, and we do not support it. It is two taxes.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I am not trying to be obtuse, but would you mind repeating that. I know the hour is late. I did not quite understand it and then I looked over at my advisers, and they did not appear to understand it either. It is no reflection on you, but it may assist us if you could repeat the question. Were you wondering about the difference between assessable income for the purposes of gathering the threshold and the contributions on which the surcharge is paid?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds know the individual, his contributions and <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">his tax file number and they send that to the tax office. The tax office then knows the assessable income. The tax office then does the work to assess whether a surcharge is payable. If the surcharge is payable, the debit is sent back to the fund. That is the process. It is not a complicated process, although you would not believe it if you read all the press and listened to Senator Sherry. I can understand why people would be worried. But they should not be, to correct the record.</PARA></SPEECH>

So, yes, in describing how that is actually managed, you have gone some way to responding to the question. You say it is a simple process, but the point has been made that it does require several communications between the fund and the tax office to progress it, adding multiple layers of administration that would have been avoided if you had called this tax a tax in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

There has been a significant increase in moneys flowing into superannuation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak on the adjournment regarding the terrible situation that has developed in Newcastle following the announcement of BHP last week that it would proceed to close the steelworks. This announcement delivered a cruel blow to many thousands of workers and their families in Newcastle. The announcement has reverberated throughout the city and throughout the community. Clearly, people in that city now&mdash;workers and their families&mdash;are facing the very bleak prospect of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it has been reported in the papers&mdash;and I think it is true, notwithstanding the attitude
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the government&mdash;this decision has really ripped the heart out of the city. It is a proud city that has been at the forefront of the manufacturing sector in this country all this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1915 the steelworks have been the heart of Newcastle. Thousands upon thousands of workers through generations of families have devoted their working lives to that industry, to that company, and one would have expected that they could have been treated a bit more civilly than they were when that announcement was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been indicated that at least 2,000 jobs will be lost, with further jobs to go in other centres around Australia. Of course many more jobs will go and businesses will be threatened through the flow&hyphen;on effects of the closure of the steelworks. Thousands of family members are wondering and asking what will be their future. What hopes do they have for jobs for themselves and for their children? Indeed, what hopes do they have for a comfortable lifestyle in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government promised the battlers of Australia. Mr Howard said that what he was about was to make the battlers of this country&mdash;the people of this country&mdash;feel relaxed and comfortable. Certainly the people of Newcastle affected by this decision directly, and those likely to be affected in the future, cannot be feeling relaxed and comfortable now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a cruel and heartless announcement, as I said, delivered with little feeling. Ironically, as that announcement was made, the share price of BHP rocketed overnight. It surged some 69c. As one article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 1 May noted, it was somewhat ironic that, as many thousands of workers were going to lose their jobs, the executive salaries of the managing director and chief executive of BHP would substantially increase in value because of the fact that they have significant shareholdings in the company. As I said, it is rather ironic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one talks about battlers, you really have to recognise that the workers of Newcastle fit very much into that category. They are people who have devoted their working
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2762"> lives to this so-called great Australian company&mdash;a company that has been a beneficiary over the years of government programs and assistance, particularly through the steel industry plan, to enable it to become competitive and a world leader in a range of industries from mining and steel to petroleum and energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to ask: what has been the reaction from this government? The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) said the announcement was `regrettable'. Frankly, the government could have been far more responsive and far more sympathetic to the situation and could have taken action to at least seek some consideration by the company of the way in which it made this announcement and its impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we had in the Senate during question time the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) attacking the unions because they have responded to the call of their members and have taken some industrial action in support of retaining their jobs. We constantly hear attacks upon unions and upon trade unionists from this government. We hear from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) that if only we could reduce the role of unions in the work force then things would be better. That is what we have been promised. That is what the battlers have been promised&mdash;jobs and better pay. But what are they getting today? In Newcastle they are getting the sack and their unions are under attack by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major union in Newcastle, the Australian Workers Union&mdash;which of course was formed out of the old AWU, and the union at Newcastle, FIME&mdash;is in there supporting the workers of Newcastle and their families, just as unions have done for over 80 years. They will continue to be there. They will continue to give that support both during this crisis and, no doubt, afterwards if people ultimately do lose their jobs. Unions are about providing support throughout the working lives of the people of this city, as indeed in all other locations around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will not be the last time I speak on this issue. This is an issue that is not going to go away. It is one that clearly the government
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has to face up to. In closing, I want to refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 1 May which referred to the union leader of the AWU in Newcastle, Mr Maurie Rudd. Mr Rudd was told some months ago that he had an inoperable brain tumour. Notwithstanding that complaint where his life is, as he acknowledges, fading away, he is back at work and he is leading the union and its members in their campaign to try to get the company to review its decision. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his more immediate pain comes from what he sees as a betrayal of the workforce. For 10 years he told the workers that they would have to wear the pain of restructuring if the steelworks was to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He often urged militant members to be patient when they wanted to strike. He believed BHP was committed to staying in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when it became clear to him three months ago that BHP would not go ahead with a promise to build a new state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art steelmaking arc furnace, he feared the worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I feel very despondent about the dishonesty of BHP. It is a killer what they have done to this town," he says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Typically, Mr Rudd has not abandoned hope. Just as he has refused to give up the fight for his life, he is determined to fight to the end to save the steelworks.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The workers of Newcastle and their families know that in Maurie Rudd they have someone who will continue to fight for their interests, for their future, to the end of his life. I hope that this government listens to people like Maurie Rudd and provides urgent support to the workers and their families of BHP at Newcastle.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2762"><TITLE>Higher Education</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to discuss the issue of education, in particular future and OECD directions in higher education. While on Australian campuses students and academics are struggling to defend the last vestiges of a publicly funded and accessible higher education system, I think we can learn a lot by looking at the current international debate over higher education issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, for example, President Bill Clinton declared that at least two years of college would be `as universal in America by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2763"> the 21st century as high school education is today'. Last week, the OECD considered a draft report into the future of higher education. The study, which examined several European countries, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, noted that higher education, once considered the domain of a privileged few or a `distant goal for a small minority', could soon reach 80 per cent or more of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1985 through to 1994, enrolment among 18- to 21-year-olds jumped from 25 per cent to 40 per cent in Canada and from 19 per cent to 33 per cent in France. In the United States, enrolment of 26- to 29-year-olds rose from eight per cent to around 10 per cent. The study predicts `ever higher levels of students at all ages' who will be seeking additional education to adjust to evolving job markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study also cites the need for increased financing to build new campuses equipped with computers and, of course, other high-tech equipment, but it says that simply raising student fees is not the answer to financing this sector. It states that `proposals for fees have provoked strong reactions in France, Germany and the United Kingdom', just as we have seen in Australia. The introduction of up&hyphen;front fees at Melbourne University was enacted through the means of a secret petition of councillors, not in the open forum of a meeting of council where views could be put and challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OECD researcher Skilbeck concluded that failing to widen educational opportunity will not only aggravate unemployment but will cause `an emerging dimension of inequality in our societies' and `many people will feel they did not get a fair chance'. I think many Australians feel that the coalition government is not giving them a fair chance when it comes to education. Up-front fees were one of the most sinister parts of the government's regressive reform of the higher education sector last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are being offered the so-called `salvation' to universities in the form of the opportunity to charge up-front and full cost fees&mdash;remembering that these institutions have been starved for funding over the last 14
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. These universities are not adopting up-front and full cost fees with glee, seizing the so-called opportunity that the government has provided. They have often done so&mdash;that is, adopted fee policies&mdash;with remorse or discomfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vice&hyphen;Chancellor Gavin Brown at Sydney University said that the decision to charge up&hyphen;front fees was not taken lightly and that in fact it was a decision taken with regret at the final passing of an era in which full public funding to our great universities was possible. It was also reported that the council passed the introduction of up-front fees because the only other choice was to shed staff. The budget cuts to university operating grants have not been nicks and cuts, as the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has stated. They have actually been quite savage cuts, forcing universities to cut costs at the expense of education, in some cases cut staff and, of course, close down campuses. Sydney University now has these regressive fees and it also has had to sack hundreds of staff members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the willingness to have the opportunity of charging these fees is based on financial imperative, not on educational or social good. The introduction of these fees has been contentious. At Deakin University, the council decided to introduce up-front fees with a vote of nine against and 12 for. But what is interesting about this issue is that, when it was brought forward for debate, it was actually done in the absence of the elected student representatives. In fact, three student representative places were vacant at the time of the decision&mdash;and, of course, they may very well have changed the decision, if you are talking about a vote of 12 to nine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities are making decisions on the introduction of up-front fees all around the country. I know that my alma mater, the University of Adelaide, will be considering the decision on Friday. I think the University of Technology of Sydney will be considering it in the next couple of weeks. The ANU has a council meeting in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these institutions are doing so without any clear indication as to the rules guiding the charging of these fees. It took
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2764"> until April for the minister for education to circulate even draft guidelines, yet university councils have been making&mdash;that is, introducing&mdash;these fee charging plans in the meantime. We have draft guidelines that are inadequate and do not even begin to address the fundamental issue of the $9,000 penalty. That penalty for those people who enrol above the so&hyphen;called 25 per cent quota will not act as a sufficient disincentive or penalty for breaching the guidelines, especially when you are charging a fee of around $110,000 in the case of Melbourne University, for example, for dentistry degrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the experiences of postgraduate fees to show us where the path will lead. It is an experience that the Labor Party would be particularly ashamed of, given that they were primarily responsible for the deregulation of the postgraduate fee paying sector. They opened the gates of user pays with the HEAC, the HECS and up-front postgraduate fees, and now under the coalition government the horse has bolted. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">10th higher education council report</EMPHASIS> on up&hyphen;front postgraduate fees found that target equity groups were disadvantaged in an up-front fee paying system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, while women made up over 50 per cent of the population, less than 42 per cent of all fee paying postgraduate places were held by women. While indigenous Australians made up 1.4 per cent of the population, their representation in full fee paying arrangements was 0.5 per cent. While rural Australians made up 24.3 per cent of the population, their representation was just over 10 per cent. While isolated Australians made up 4.4 per cent of the population, only 2.2 per cent were represented in fee paying postgraduate courses. The most devastating figure of all is the representation of Australians from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in these courses. They make up one&hyphen;quarter of the nation's population, but comprise only 6.59 per cent of those enrolled in fee paying postgraduate courses, which is quite shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember that when up-front fees were originally charged for postgraduate fee paying places, we were promised by the former government that they would be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capped at 20 per cent of load. That does not even compare with the 25 per cent so-called cap that the minister has set down for this government in relation to undergraduate fee paying places. Claims by this government that the undergraduate HECS load will be maintained are also dubious. In this year alone we have seen 4,210 HECS liable postgraduate places sacrificed. So the government rhetoric that funding cuts to operating grants came without sacrificing student undergraduate numbers also rings hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only the Australian Democrats have been the party with a clear vision and a clear commitment in this area&mdash;that is, to a publicly funded and accessible education system. We have often been alone voting on these particular issues, but I would like to acknowledge that we have the community on our side. Many polls have shown recently&mdash;and, of course, throughout the last year while this debate has gone on&mdash;that the community is opposed to up-front fees. They are opposed to increased HECS and reduced operating grants, and the community still holds firmly the belief that education should be accessible to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note an AVCC commissioned Newspoll last week showed that 73.18 per cent of those people who responded to the survey believed that higher education is very important in shaping the nation's future. Only 5.56 per cent did not believe that higher education was important. Some 94 per cent believe that we should be spending at least the same or more than our Asian neighbours on higher education, and 60 per cent believe that government spending on higher education is too low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came into power on a pledge to address the funding clawback of 13 per cent to that sector over the 13 years of Labor rule. They have had the audacity, of course, now to implement a five per cent cut in just three years, on top of the funding decreases that they promised to fix. John Howard said, `Nothing saps the confidence and the faith of the people in their elected representatives more than the cynical repudiation of promises shortly after a change of government.' I put it to you, Madam President, that nowhere has there been a more blatant betrayal of promises
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2765"> and commitments to the electorate by this government than in the area of higher education policy.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2765"><TITLE>Victorian Auditor-General</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the matter of the proposed changes to the role and function of the Victorian Auditor-General. The Commonwealth government has a role and responsibility in this matter which it is currently neglecting. The Kennett government's review of the Auditor&hyphen;General is an attack not only on the powers of Mr Baragwanath and future Auditors-General to act as a check on government, but also on the very fabric of the model of the separation of powers and accountable government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General has a central place in the accountability chain and has a fundamental watchdog role in the Australian system of government. The Auditor-General's office is responsible for the external audits of the financial affairs of the Victorian public sector and for the performance audits which assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the management of public sector resources in the state. It therefore plays a key role in the accountability process of the government to the parliament and ultimately to the taxpayers and the public of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Kennett government initiated the review into the Victorian Audit Act 1994 in line with national competition policy rules. That an accountability agency should be dealt with in this way was extraordinary. The move rang alarm bells in some sectors of the community, but so far the Commonwealth government has not commented. The report, handed down late last month, intends to considerably alter, to the detriment of the people of Victoria, the powers and role of the Auditor and threatens to materially weaken our system of responsible government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An independent Auditor-General is an essential part of the accountability chain which helps parliament blow the whistle on government waste. There needs to be a constant vigilance on government waste by chief executives, by the Department of Fi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nance, by government and through the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office and its state equivalents can and do save governments millions of dollars. The Auditor&hyphen;General also ensures government resources are used efficiently and reviews government contract arrangements to make sure that public money is not placed at unnecessary risk. The 1992 WA Inc. royal commission emphatically stated the importance of the Auditor-General in the chain of accountability:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The office of Auditor-General provides a critical link in the accountability chain between the public sector, the Parliament and the community. It alone subjects the practical conduct and operations of the public sector as a whole to regular, independent investigation and review. This function must be fully guaranteed and its discharge facilitated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Victorian Audit Act review report signals the end of the Auditor-General's exclusive right to report, and exclusive right to decide who reports for it, on the public sector. One of the central findings of the report is that the public sector audit office is separated from the Auditor-General's office and created as a government business enterprise&mdash;`business,' when we are talking about accountability. That business enterprise will be called Audit Victoria. Audit Victoria would operate on fully commercial terms under a board of management, providing audit and related services to the public sector in competition with private sector firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institutionalisation of outsourcing and tenders for audits of government departments without the  Auditor-General's absolute control would undermine and endanger the chain of accountability that operates in our system of government. This is not to say that the Auditor-General should never contract out any of its auditing requirements. The Victorian Auditor-General already makes significant use of private auditors. In 1995&hyphen;96, the Auditor&hyphen;General in Victoria paid a total of $5.8 million to private auditors, compared with a total expenditure of approximately $17.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General, however, must have the power to determine what functions, audits or inquiries should be outsourced and tendered. The Auditor-General must also have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2766"> the power to reject a privately tendered audit should this need arise. In this way, the independence and accountability functions of the Auditor-General are not curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992 WA Inc. royal commission&mdash;established in the wake of the allegations of corruption and illegal and improper conduct in the affairs, investment decisions and business dealings of the Labor government of Western Australia&mdash;reported on the essential nature of the independence of the Auditor-General from the government and the executive. The royal commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General is the Parliament's principal informant on the performance of the administrative system. The Parliament therefore has a special responsibility to ensure both that the independence and the effective resourcing of the Auditor&hyphen;General are secured . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While the Victorian report proposes to enhance the independence of the auditor by making him or her an independent officer of the parliament&mdash;which would be welcome if it was accompanied by the financial independence of the parliament&mdash;the extensive reduction of the auditor's powers with the audit program makes the increased independence farcical. The proposal that financial audits and performance audits be conducted by private auditing firms underestimates the scope of the Auditor-General's tasks and its function as a fundamental accountability agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General is no mere scrutineer of financial affairs of departments and agencies of government, notwithstanding the importance of this responsibility. A recognition of this fact highlights the inappropriateness of tendering or outsourcing many of the Auditor-General's functions. To do so places at risk the practices and principles of open, accountable and transparent government&mdash;a civic duty, not a business duty. It is a principle theme in recent inquiries and reports in Western Australia and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992 WA Inc. royal commission in report No. 2 pointed to the scope of the auditor functions, which included more than merely auditing financial accounts. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In auditing the accounts of an agency, the Auditor-General is expected to address . . . such matters as the agency's compliance with the law and the legislation and directions under which it acts and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the controls it has to secure that compliance; the probity of official conduct in its financial affairs; the appropriateness of performance indicators; and, of no little importance . . . the adequacy of the records on which its management is based and carried into effect . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In our current system of government, the Auditor-General has an expanding and far&hyphen;reaching responsibility to `keep them honest,' one which relates directly to protecting the public purse. This must be borne in mind when considering any changes to the role of this agency and the structure of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to allow government departments to select their own auditor has serious implications for the independence of the auditor and the accountability of government departments to parliament. The Australian Democrats believe that the role and function of the Auditor-General's department in Victoria should not differ from those governing Auditor-Generals elsewhere in Australia. It is my concern and the concern of the Australian Democrats that the Victorian proposals will open the door once again, and even more so, to the eighties style of entrepreneurial government. There are enough alarm bells ringing in Victoria right now without that happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than weakening the role of the Auditor-General, the auditor's powers should be widened and strengthened if the public is to obtain the benefit and protection that the Auditor&hyphen;General is capable of providing. The government should ensure that the Auditor-General is a properly resourced and independent accountability agency which can effectively act on behalf of the people of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian report and proposals are out of step. Indeed, they are moving in the opposite direction to that which was strongly advocated and ultimately recommended by inquiries in Western Australia and the Commonwealth. The federal government should be concerned with these developments in Victoria if it is serious about government responsibility and accountability to the parliament and if it holds the Westminster system, or any system of separation of powers and accountability, with any regard. It is absolutely vital that the Auditor-General remain outside the control of the government of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2767"> day and be answerable only to the parliament if we are to ensure proper accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform options proposed in the terms of reference include consideration of whether government departments should be able to choose their own private auditor. This would mean that government departments could bypass independent scrutiny through the appointment of a private auditor, which is a serious prospect. Those who follow my press releases would know that we are determined, if this situation is not addressed by the Commonwealth, to move amendments to any Auditor-Generals bill put before this Senate to protect Commonwealth moneys used by the Victorian government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11.34 p.m." PAGE="2767"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 11.34 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(l)(a) and (b) and (3)(a) and (b). Australia abstained in voting at the 1996 session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Malaysian-sponsored resolution concerning the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons (resolution 51/45 M, in previous committee stage consideration called L.37). A key paragraph of the resolution (operative paragraph 4) calls on all states "to immediately fulfil this obligation by commencing multilateral negotiations in 1997 leading to the early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention prohibiting the development,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2772"> production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, transfer, threat or use of nuclear weapons and providing for their elimination." Australia did, however, vote in favour of the paragraph of the resolution (operative paragraph 3) which underlined the unanimous conclusion of the Court that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the twin goals of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament. It was therefore sympathetic to the general aims embodied in this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, however, many steps to be taken on the road to the goal of nuclear disarmament before the question of a single nuclear weapons convention can be productively addressed. Whereas a multilaterally negotiated legal instrument may well be a focus of the final phases of the elimination of nuclear weapons, the Government believes it is more productive in present circumstances to continue to encourage the nuclear weapon states, particularly the United States and Russia, to maintain the current momentum of nuclear arsenal reductions, notably under the START (Treaty on Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms) process. In this context, the Government notes and welcomes the recent agreement between the United States and Russia on guidelines for a further round of such reductions, known as START III, which will look toward further reducing strategic warhead stockpiles for both countries to some 80 percent below Cold War peaks. To attempt to force the pace by "multilateralising" nuclear disarmament prematurely would run the risk of impeding the concrete nuclear disarmament measures currently being undertaken by diverting attention from those negotiations. The Government does not consider it a realistic or productive expenditure of diplomatic capital to attempt to persuade the nuclear weapon states to adhere to a timetable for nuclear disarmament which does not take account of the global strategic environment. The latter factor will remain the key determinant of the pace of nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was made clear in a statement accompanying its vote, the Government, for the reasons adduced above, would have preferred resolution 51/45M to focus attention on the immediate and intermediate concrete steps which will take forward the process of nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to continuing nuclear arsenal reductions by the nuclear weapon states, a key next step on the road to nuclear disarmament is the early commencement of substantive negotiations on a convention banning the production of fissile
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (known as a "cut-off" convention). This is widely acknowledged as the next logical step for multilateral negotiations after the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and would be a major new addition to the process of nuclear disarmament and to strengthening barriers to nuclear proliferation. The Government is currently working hard in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to get "cut-off" negotiations under way and concluded as soon as possible in that forum. In parallel with this activity, the Government will: continue to encourage full implementation of the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms between the United States and Russia (START II), and further nuclear reduction through, for example, START III; work for widespread adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; promote the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; and support the enhanced Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review process which commences this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) and (b) In its Advisory Opinion on the legality of use or threat of nuclear weapons handed down on 8 July 1996, the International Court of Justice said, inter alia, that "there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control". This aspect of the Court's Opinion was agreed unanimously and did not refer to the specific concept of a single nuclear weapons convention. The United Nations General Assembly resolution referred to in paragraph (1) of the question was considerably more prescriptive and specific in its treatment of the issue, as indicated in the first paragraph of the answer to paragraph ( 1) of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) and (b) As the answers to questions (l) and (3) above make clear, the Government does not support calls for a timebound framework for nuclear disarmament as embodied in the resolution. The Government believes it is more productive to focus on promoting practical, realistic steps towards the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. It considers that calls for a prescriptive timebound approach to the disarmament process are patently not realistic, and therefore do nothing to advance the cause of disarmament in any concrete or practical way. What is required to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament is the patient and dogged pursuit of the various inter-locking steps on the path to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The Government believes that it is more productive for the international community to concentrate on actually achieving further concrete progress towards nuclear disarmament rather than seeking to debate an artificial timetable for the achievement of a single nuclear weapons conven

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) New Zealand voted in favour of resolution 51/45 M, noting in particular its reference to the unanimous finding of the International Court of Justice of the obligation to pursue and conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament. New Zealand was of the view that the resolution reinforced this obligation and was consistent with New Zealand's advocacy of the pursuit of negotiations on a phased programme of disarmament leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons. As noted above, Australia also voted in favour of this particular aspect of the resolution but, for the reasons set out above, was unable to support the resolution as a whole</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(b) The United States voted against resolution 51/45 M, criticising what it called the resolution's selective quotation from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference principles and objectives document, and its attempt to turn an advisory opinion into a legal edict requiring the immediate commencement of negotiations and their rapid conclusion in a multilateral forum. It was the view of the U.S. that the Court, in calling for the conclusion of negotiations, had added nothing to the obligation under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the U.S. took seriously. The U.S. representative noted President Clinton's pledge to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 that, as soon as the Russian Federation ratified the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II), bilateral discussions on further reductions in strategic forces would begin. The U.S. remained convinced that <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">this bilateral </EMPHASIS> effort was the sensible approach in current circumstances and the one most likely to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">achieve </EMPHASIS> concrete results. The U.S. took the view that a multilateral negotiating forum was not conducive to taking forward what was an extremely intricate process of nuclear disarmament involving careful trade-offs, specialised verification arrangements and sensitive security calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Iceland abstained in voting on resolution 51/45 M, saying that it did not give a balanced and even-handed picture of the Court's Opinion and attempted to subordinate bilateral nuclear arms negotiations to the work of the Conference on Disarmament. According to Iceland, the resolution could only diminish the value of the Court's Opinion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austria abstained in voting on resolution 51/45 M. In so doing, Austria urged further acceleration of the process of nuclear disarmament towards the ultimate realisation of a nuclear weapons convention, but noted that a number of intermediate but

In so doing it entered a statement also on behalf of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, explaining that it was not voting against the Opinion of the International Court of Justice, but that the resolution, in quoting selectively from the text of the Court's Opinion, was not a serious enough approach to the Advisory Opinion and fostered polemical debate about nuclear disarmament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(c) and (d) As the balance of recommendations of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons makes clear, the nuclear weapon states will continue for some time to bear the major responsibility for steps to reduce further their nuclear stockpiles, with a view to their ultimate elimination. By focusing exclusively on the possible end-point of what will by necessity continue to be a complex process of bilateral and plurilateral negotiations, 51/45 M ignored this fact, thereby misrepresenting the road ahead for nuclear disarmament. Australia will continue through private dialogue to encourage the nuclear weapon states, and the United States and Russia in particular, to continue the good progress they have made to date in reducing their arsenals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above, Australia is fully committed to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. Our priority in this area is to focus on practical, realistic steps to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons, which may at a future point include a nuclear weapons convention. In this respect we consider that calls for a prescriptive timebound approach to the disarmament process as espoused in resolution 51/45 O are patently not realistic in current circumstances, and therefore do nothing to advance the cause of disarmament in any concrete or practical way. In the Government's view, it is unproductive to advocate the sort of tight linkage that holds one negotiation or process hostage to the conclusion of another. This tends to be the result, intended or otherwise, of the efforts of the proponents of the time-bound framework concept. The Government is firmly of the view that it is more productive for the international community to concentrate on actually achieving further progress towards nuclear disarmament rather than seeking to debate an artificial concept or timetable. Such debate is currently delaying the start of negotiations on a "cut-off" convention in the Conference on Disarmament. It was for these reasons that Australia voted against the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Government acknowledges that there is support amongst the Non-Aligned Movement group of countries and some non-governmental organisations for time-bound nuclear disarmament. It understands the prima facie attractiveness of this concept for those dedicated to the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons. However, for the set of reasons elaborated in response to the questions above, the Government, while sharing the dedication to the goal of nuclear disarmament, continues to be of the view that calls for a prescriptive time-bound process to achieve nuclear disarmament do not in fact take the world any closer to achieving this goal.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government of the State of South Australia is responsible for land management in that jurisdiction, including the issue of land titles, mining titles and exploration licences. The following reply is based on information supplied to the Commonwealth by the South Australian Crown Solicitor's Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) There are 331 pastoral leases in South Australia which amount to 219 stations or management units (often called `runs'). Many stations are comprised of multiple leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Pastoral leases have been issued in South Australia since the 1850s. All of the current leases have been issued since 1961. In 1989 all leases were extended by the South Australian Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 for a term of 42 years from the commencement of the legislation. This was accomplished by the noting of a Certificate of Alteration on each of the Certificates of Title of the leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There are currently 2 stations held or controlled by Aboriginal persons or communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There are 2 pastoral leases that currently have registered sub&hyphen;leases. In South Australia the relevant Minister's approval is required for this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) There are 211 lessees holding South Australian pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> (b) The lessor of all pastoral leases in South Australia is the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes. This information is available from the Pastoral Management Branch, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) All South Australian pastoral leases were issued under the Pastoral Act 1936 (SA) and the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) There was no premium charged to the lessee on the initial issue of the lease. In terms of costs incurred by the Crown for surveying, defining and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2785"> issuing the leases, this would have been under $1,000 per lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) Under the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA) the terms of all South Australian pastoral leases existing at the commencement of that Act were extended to run until 2032. Since then various leases have had their terms extended under Clause 4(3) of Division 2 of the Schedule to that Act. These extensions are evidenced by Certificates of Alteration and are noted on the Certificates of Title of the relevant leases. Such an extension runs for 42 years from the date of the extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Each pastoral lease is for a term of 42 years which will normally be extended every 14 years under the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA) to run 42 years from the extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Yes. Under section 25 of the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA) the term of the lease will be extended every 14 years on the application of the leaseholder to run 42 years from the extension. Such an extension may only be refused if there has been a breach of a condition of the lease leading to degradation of the land or where the leaseholder has failed to discharge a duty imposed on them by the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(16) (a) There is, effectively, a free market in pastoral leases in South Australia. Although the relevant Minister's consent is required in order to transfer these leases under the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA) this may not be refused unreasonably and generally is given as a matter of course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under the Constitution responsibility for water resource management including water allocation is a matter of the State and Territory governments. The Warwick Shire Council in Queensland has responsibility for the water resources and planning within its jurisdiction. This is not a matter of Commonwealth responsibility, however, I have been advised that Warwick Shire Council is negotiating with Danpork Australia to allocate a small portion of the Council's town water. The available water for urban use is in the order of 4_250 megalitres a year, made up from an allocation from Leslie Dam, which is under the jurisdiction of the Queensland Department of Natural Resources, and the Council's Connelly
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dam. The urban consumption rate of Warwick Shire prior to the introduction of consumer meters was 2 500 megalitres a year and is currently 2_000 megalitres a year, resulting in a saving of 500 megalitres a year. This leaves the Council with 2 250 megalitres a year of available water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Using the figures in the response to Question (1) the proposed allocation would be approximately twelve percent of the town's nominal urban water allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is current management practice in towns in urban areas in Queensland during drought periods to restrict water consumption. I have been advised that Warwick Shire Council was placed on restrictions during the recent drought, however, at the lowest point during the drought the town supply reserve was sufficient for a further two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes. Section 100 of the Australian Constitution reads: The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Given the recent savings in town water consumption and the available supply of almost double the current urban demand, there would appear to be little threat to residents' water needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Constitution refers to actions by the Commonwealth, not to actions by local government, and the arrangements for managing the Warwick town water supply could not, in my view lead to a breach of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) As indicated above, this is not a matter in which the Commonwealth has any jurisdiction. Nevertheless, I am informed that Council, in consultation with Queensland Departments, has undertaken a thorough planning process.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">test purposes. However, with the superannuation preservation age generally set at age 55, most early retirees have the opportunity to access their superannuation from age 55. There is evidence from ABS surveys and from DSS case records that an increasing number of people aged between the preservation and age pension ages are leaving substantial funds in superannuation rollover funds. Because superannuation assets are exempt from both the income and assets tests, these people may also be obtaining social security payments, such as new start allowance, but may nonetheless also be drawing on the earnings and capital in their superannuation rollover funds to boost income in early retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national savings effects of means testing the superannuation assets of those aged 55 and over and on income support for at least 9 months have not been modelled by the Retirement Income Modelling Task Force. The current exemption of such assets from the social security means test has led to insufficient social security data upon which to do so.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QWN></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
