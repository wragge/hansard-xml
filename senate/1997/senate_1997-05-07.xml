<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Bolkus and Senator Margetts, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether statements by Senator Colston and Mrs C Smith, relating to payments of travelling allowances to Senator Colston, tabled in the Senate on 24 March and 6 May 1997, were false or misleading in any particular, and, if so, whether a contempt of the Senate was committed by the making of those statements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue before the chamber is whether the Senate Privileges Committee should undertake an inquiry into whether the tabled statements by Senator Colston and Mrs Christine Smith were false and misleading in any particular and, if so, whether a contempt of the Senate was committed. The opposition strongly believes that it is not only appropriate but absolutely imperative that the Privileges Committee investigate these matters. As the Clerk of the Senate said in his advice to me on 18 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to imagine an issue more important to the integrity and the proper operation of the legislature than ensuring that statements deliberately made to it are truthful and that untruthful statements are detected and a remedy applied to the making of such statements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So let me outline the basis on which the opposition believes there is good reason to suppose that the tabled statements of Senator Colston and Mrs Smith were untruthful in some particular. I think our case in respect of this is strong. In fact, I think it is so self-evident that even Senator Hill and Senator Alston might not challenge it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You, Madam President, tabled in the Senate on 24 March a document that was entitled `Senator Colston: Travelling allowance documents tabled by Madam President.' Those
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> documents included two letters from Senator Colston attempting to explain his bogus travel claims. They also included a statement from Mrs Smith, who was Senator Colston's office manager from August 1992 to December 1996. In his letter to you on 24 March, Senator Colston claimed by way of explaining the cause of 19 overpayments that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My investigations have discovered that the inadequate bookkeeping systems in my office led to administrative errors on the part of my office staff which caused the overpayments. I would regularly ask my office manager at the time for the dates of my travelling to place on my claims and I would transcribe those dates onto the claim form. In doing so, I assumed that the dates which were given to me by my office manager were correct. In the course of my investigation I have discovered that in numerous cases these dates were not correct.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Colston also wrote to the Clerk of the Senate on 24 March offering the same explanation for a further six overpayments. In support of Senator Colston's explanation, and included in his letter to you, Madam President, there was a statement that he knew full well would be tabled in the Senate, a statement signed by Mrs Christine Smith and dated 24 March 1997. In this statement Mrs Smith confirmed that she had acted as office manager for Senator Colston during the relevant period. She also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of my duties during that time was to record the dates for which the senator was eligible for travelling allowance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She explained that the senator often notified her of changes, but stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not notify the transport officers required nor did I sometimes make adequate note of the changed travel arrangements. The only excuse that I have is that the pressures of work in the office made me put these matters to one side. The result was that on a number of occasions I gave the senator an incorrect list of dates for his travelling allowance claims. The senator accepted the dates I provided to him as being correct.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs Smith's statement concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept full responsibility for providing the wrong dates to Senator Colston for transcription to his travel allowance claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then on 8 April Mrs Smith supplied additional information to you and to the Clerk of the Senate. In that communication, which you tabled yesterday, Mrs Smith stated that she
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2802"> wished to withdraw her earlier statement, and replaced it with a statement that declared, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the senator and I were aware at this time that in fact the mistakes were not mine as it was not part of my duties to provide the senator with information for his TA claims nor did I ever provide claims on his behalf.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked the senator whether the statement had in fact already been typed because I had not done it and he said words to the effect of: `Yes, Douglas has been working all weekend.' I now wish to advise that my statement was incorrect. I was not responsible for preparing the senator's travelling allowance claims nor required to keep a record of dates of travel for TA purposes. The senator always prepared his own claims.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, if any of these versions of events happens to be true or is to be believed, the inescapable conclusion is that misleading evidence has been provided to the Senate. On the basis of the second statement, both Senator Colston and Mrs Smith knowingly provided misleading statements to the Senate on 24 March. Further, Mrs Smith's statement asserts that a member of Senator Colston's staff, Mr Douglas Colston, was responsible for drafting her first statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely these must be the most serious matters of privilege that could be raised. The record shows that the Senate has always taken extremely seriously any suggestion that misleading evidence had been given to it or to any of its committees. What we are dealing with here is, on the face of it, a very deliberate attempt to mislead the Senate by supplying a false statement. As the Clerk of the Senate has pointed out, it is difficult to imagine that the Senate should regard these circumstances as worthy of less attention than earlier less serious cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address the issue of the parallel police inquiry which the government alleges would be prejudiced by an inquiry by the Senate privileges committee. It is common ground that the conflicting statements by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith are covered by parliamentary privilege and therefore cannot be used in any way in legal proceedings. In other words, it is only the parliament
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is competent to investigate the issue of deliberate misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is whether the Senate privileges committee inquiry would necessarily prejudice the police inquiry. But I put to you and to the Senate that the answer to that question is no. Firstly, the matters which are subject to the police inquiry on the one hand, that is, the fraudulent claims on the Commonwealth, and on the other hand the matters which would be subject to a Senate privileges inquiry, that is, whether the Senate has been deliberately misled, are two separate matters. They are quite distinct matters. Of course, there might be some overlap between the two, but the terms of reference to the Senate privileges committee, which we are debating, have been deliberately strictly limited to matters of misleading and possible contempt. They do not go to the issue of fraudulent claims. Secondly, while the statements are covered by parliamentary privilege and are therefore not available to the police inquiry, the primary evidence on which they are based is accessible to the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in the interests of ensuring that there is no risk at all of prejudice to the police inquiry, I have proposed, on behalf of the opposition, that there be a meeting between all parliamentary leaders in the Senate to ensure that the terms of reference to the privileges committee are framed in such a way as to avoid any possible trespass into the Australian Federal Police inquiry. Needless to say, I have not had the courtesy or the benefit of any reply from the government to my proposal. Nor have I had any response from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to my written request for a confidential briefing on the terms of reference of the police inquiry&mdash;a briefing which would have assisted us greatly in ensuring that any potential overlap between the two inquiries was avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say, Madam President, that I have even suggested that, to allay any concerns of possible prejudice to the police inquiry, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department make available to the Senate privileges committee an adviser who would ensure that the committee did not trespass on the AFP  inqui
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2803"> ries. Again, I have had no response from the government on those proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Senate of the words of its Clerk. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to imagine how the Senate can be asked to refrain from inquiry into a matter of such seriousness and of such significance to its operations on the basis that its inquiry might cause some inconvenience in a prosecution of different acts as a criminal offence, a prosecution which at present is only potential.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, the case is clear. The issue that we are debating now is the concern about timing. I genuinely believe that the Senate privileges committee does have sufficient experience and expertise to be able to deal with this matter in a manner which would mean that the issues before it did not trespass or interfere in any way with the matters being inquired into by the Australian Federal Police. But, of course, if the Senate comes to the view that they have concerns about this, if the Senate becomes convinced that that remains a concern, perhaps the amendment that has been foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats might be one that it might consider embracing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now is a situation where, regrettably, as the debate before us proceeds, you see the government digging in deeper and deeper to protect what remains of their very substantial investment in Senator Colston. Their arguments may also, of course, be motivated by a concern that a Senate inquiry might stray into operational areas of a police inquiry, but I think probably more likely their concern is that such a privileges inquiry might stray into those areas which might shed some light on the arrangements that the government entered into to secure Senator Colston's votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done our best to try to allay those concerns. We have been very straightforward about what we want to see the Senate Privileges Committee deal with. It is important to place on record that you do have, as I have said, an enormous investment from the government in Senator Colston. After all, we know that the government did everything they could to resist any call for an Australian Federal Police investigation until the clamour became too great, until the public and media pressure was so hot, even Mr Howard had to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cave in. We know how, until the eleventh hour, they resisted all the calls for Senator Colston to resign as Deputy President of the Senate. It was only right at the end&mdash;the absolute last gasp&mdash;late one night that that weak leader Mr Howard finally agreed to refer this matter to the Australian Federal Police for an investigation and report as the opposition had been calling for for months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still see Mr Howard and the government refuse to endorse the call from the opposition and the Labor Party for Senator Colston to resign from the Senate. I say today that it is now an occasion for Mr Howard and his government to do something positive about the Colston issue, to show for the first time some genuine leadership and to do something that might restore the confidence of the Australian people in the standing of the parliament as an institution and in the standing of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Mr Howard who rode into government on a white charger saying that as one of his highest priorities he would do something about parliamentary standards and the standing of our parliamentary institution in the eyes of the Australian public. What has he done? He has presided over a situation where the parliament's standing is at its lowest ebb in our history since Federation. That is the truth of the matter. That is Mr Howard's achievement. That is what he has been able to do. He has debauched the institution of the parliament through his behaviour in relation to the Colston affair. I believe the Australian population have caught on to this in spades. Mr Howard and Mr Howard's government have an opportunity today to do something about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have something to say to Senator Harradine, who is very important in this debate, particularly if the government applies its latest scam to try to wring some value from the Colston votes&mdash;still trying to squeeze the last bit of benefit from the deal they did with Senator Colston by his latest artificial scam as to how he votes in the chamber. In the light of that device, that artificial mechanism, Senator Harradine's vote on this matter becomes very important. Madam President, I urge Senator Harradine,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2804"> and particularly I urge you, as the President of the Senate with the responsibility to uphold the standing of this institution, to give very serious consideration to this matter before the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday when Senator Sue West was elected as Deputy President of the Senate, she has a great responsibility in the light of what has occurred over the past few months courtesy of the Howard government's approach to the parliament and courtesy of what has occurred over the past year or so during the life of the Howard government in relation to the standing of the parliament in the eyes of the community. This is an opportunity to start to rebuild confidence in the Senate, to start to rebuild confidence in the institution of the parliament and to start to rebuild some confidence in members of parliament and senators, which is also at an all-time low in the public mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I urge you, Madam President, and I urge Senator Harradine, to weigh very carefully the arguments that I presented in support of this motion. I ask you also to weigh very carefully the arguments and the advice put forward by the Clerk of the Senate on this matter. I urge you and I urge all senators in this chamber to support this motion in the interests of clearing up the most serious matter of grievously misleading the Senate and in the interests of restoring public trust and confidence in both parliament and its members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as the co&hyphen;sponsor of the motion that we are debating today concerning Senator Colston. On 9 April 1997 I wrote to you expressing my concerns about the issues raised in the statement by Mrs Christine Smith, her role and that of Senator Colston and the response by Senator Colston to the report by the Department of the Senate officers concerning the claim that he had fraudulently claimed travelling allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no personal grudge in any way against Senator Colston. I have no personal feelings of anger or revenge. I have nothing of that in putting this letter. My feelings are and always have been that it is necessary for the Senate as an elected chamber&mdash;to my belief the only chamber&mdash;of the federal parlia
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment, where there is some sort of ability for the community to access the actual debate, put their views forward and maybe change the way decisions are made in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considering how important the Senate is, I believe it is extremely important that, no matter what people think of individual senators and members, no matter what they think of the parliament, no matter what they think of the lifestyles of individual senators, they have this belief that when a direct question is asked in this place there is a reasonable expectation that to the best knowledge of the person who has asked that reasonable question, the answer is the truth. There is in many ways a lack of faith in many of the institutions in modern society: in the police, in the church, in schools and teachers. A lot of this is partly a beat&hyphen;up by the media. On various occasions they will focus on individuals, then there will be a spate of cases and then suddenly the whole institution is considered threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not necessarily that there are more cases now than there were before. We now have multimedia that enable everybody to find out all at once what the issues are. In the past, I guess, many of these things would never surface. In the past, many things with politicians and royalty would never make the news pages. However, it is a different society we are living in today. We are finding out that the general level of belief, if there ever was a huge level of belief, and the general level of trust in politicians in particular&mdash;not so much the political system&mdash;is about as low as it has been for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what that belief is about politicians, I have to say that those people who are friends and family of politicians and know what type of lifestyle it is&mdash;how long you spend away from the people you love, how your hours are taken up on your weekends, how no time is actually your own and how difficult it is to get away and actually have a break of any sort&mdash;and those people who work their insides out within the office structures and within the support base of politicians to try to make a better world, deserve, as well as the wider community, to know that there are some elements within the parlia
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2805"> mentary process which are considered important. I believe that the ability to believe that a direct question in this place is expected to be answered by the truth is one of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the basis by which I have put forward my request. That is the basis upon which I have co-sponsored this notice of motion and that is the basis upon which I urge the Senate to support it and to support it as a matter of urgency. I do think that there are issues in the end where, if we fail to act, we will be laying a legacy for the future, which I think we will all regret in terms of the public confidence in, I guess, one of the few institutions where they feel there is a lot of control, if you like, in their lives in relation to the way this body works. You only have to look at last night's superannuation bill, for example, to see that the Senate can make a lot of changes to people's lives overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the end, people need to believe that the parliament is accountable, they need to know that, for instance, ministers are accountable and that if they ask questions, if they ask individual senators or members specific questions or for information in writing in particular, they are able to have a reasonable assumption that that information will be correct to the best of the knowledge of the person giving that information. Therefore, I urge the Senate's support for this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continual questions of the media on this issue reflect the huge concern of the public. We know that parliament has been damaged by this affair and we all know that the damage is long term. We hope that it will not be fatal. There is a requirement that all matters relevant to senators and members be exposed in this issue of entitlements and allowances. The Senate, to its credit, has moved to greater and greater exposure. The House of Representatives has not. The Prime Minister must be strongly condemned by us and the nation for failing to take the lead by having the same degree of exposure that we are seeking and have sought in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving to the matter at hand, whilst due process and even-handedness are essential and necessary, I would say to the Senate that, in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this matter, time is of the essence. We cannot allow the damage to continue. I believe that no comfort, no quarter and no leeway must be offered in this matter over and above the essential requirements of natural justice. We have received advice from the Attorney-General and the Clerk of the Senate. That advice is partial. Both those counsels are esteemed and respected sources. Unfortunately, they differ and the Senate has insufficient advice to be sure that the route we propose to follow would not result in a lesser outcome than we would desire in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats wish to avoid a situation where the fullest power of the Senate and of the police and of the courts can be exercised. The strength and vigour of this institution must be protected and the strength of this institution must be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been afraid that the Labor motion before us would give at least one particular senator the opportunity to vote against it with the excuse of the conflicting advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's counsel and the clerk. As a consequence of a situation where we have limited advice to deal with and of my fear that the motion, as it stands, might provide an excuse for a particular senator to vote against the motion, I have put before the Senate motion 503. I think everyone in the Senate has it. I would like to alter item 3 of my amendment which has been circulated and change the date from 15 May to 29 May. I have made that change at the request of Senator Ray who quite properly pointed out that the existing date is very difficult to deal with given that the coming week is the budget week and all the efforts associated with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will listen with particular care to the speeches of Senator Ray, a member of the Privileges Committee, and Senator Hill, the leader of the coalition in the Senate. I would like to hear the reaction of both to my amendment. You will see that the purpose of my amendment is to provide our Privileges Committee, a very considerable and experienced body, with the opportunity of assessing more fully the true risk that such an inquiry may present to any legal proceedings arising out of matters in relation to Senator Colston
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2806"> currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as the Australian Democrats do not want, under any circumstances, the full recourse of both the law and the Senate to be restrained in any sense. They should recommend whether an inquiry should proceed and the Senate should then make a determination, in our view, once we have a much deeper analysis of this particular issue than we have had presented to us to this time. I do not intend to speak on this much more. We have given, both privately and publicly, full support to the opposition in their intention to have this matter fully, publicly and quickly exposed and dealt with. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing I did agree with in Senator Murray's contribution was that we should not forget the rules of natural justice in this matter. It certainly has not in any way inhibited the Labor Party in its contribution in relation to Senator Colston from day one of this exercise. The Labor Party found Senator Colston guilty without a trial, convicted him and sought to bring him down, successfully as it has turned out, and to remove him from the deputy presidency. Of course, they will not rest until he has been driven out of the Senate. The objective is to replace him with a Labor vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to give Senator Ray in particular some credit because he has been quite honest about all of this. It was Senator Colston who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had to be punished for his treachery to the Labor Party. He had to be punished for his decision to leave the party for reasons he saw fit by being driven from office. Senator Ray was up-front and honest about that from day one. For that, as I said, I give him some credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also give some credit to Mr Crean, one of the senior frontbenchers of the Labor Party, who advised the press that the purpose&mdash;you might listen to this, Senator Murray&mdash;of referring this inquiry to the Senate Privileges Committee was to get the government. It had nothing at all to do with issues such as the sanctity of the Senate, whether the public should have confidence in the Senate or whether they should be able to rely on truthful statements being made to the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a practising politician I understand that. Your game is to seek to defeat the government and that is all you are interested in one step on. The first step is to punish Colston for his treachery. The second step is to seek to use this exercise to advantage your position
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2807"> vis-a-vis the government. We understand what the real story is. It is consistent with the Labor Party's approach to the whole Colston affair from day one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Day one goes back a long way. After these matters started to come onto the table rather than under the table we learnt a great deal. We learnt that in 1983 there was a matter raised concerning Senator Colston&mdash;a matter that was sufficiently serious that the senior law officers of the land advised Mr Beazley, who then had the administrative responsibility as minister, and the Attorney-General, then Senator Gareth Evans who is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that the matter should be referred to the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But was it referred to the Federal Police? No, it was settled. They took the money and put the file in the bottom drawer. That sounds familiar, Senator Ray.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this, Senator Faulkner said, `But after 1992 we promoted him to nothing else.' That was the then explanation. It became awkward, so after 1992 they did not promote him. But they did. They put him on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The regs and ordinances committee is what you are now complaining about. They argue that, when he was on the regs and ordinances committee, he rorted the books. But they put him on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Labor put him on the committee that scrutinises members' interests. So, despite what they knew, despite what they had in the bottom drawer, they continued to promote Senator Colston. So what has changed? What changed was that he moved from one side of the chamber to the Independent benches. That is the only difference that occurred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. You see, Senator Carr, you get driven by the opinion polls; we get driven by principle. And that is something worth standing here to say. We said that he should be given an opportunity to answer. We said that, when matters were not then satisfactory, it should be sent to the Federal Police. It was sent to the Federal Police. That is in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2808"> very stark contrast, I would suggest, Senator Carr. Labor put it in the bottom drawer; the coalition government sent it to the Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police are looking at it. The police are deciding whether further action should be taken. The issue now is whether there is in fact action that the Senate should take notwithstanding the police investigation because there is now a letter on the table&mdash;a letter that has been presented to the Senate&mdash;which, on the face of it, is misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not dispute the right of the Privileges Committee to examine that, because I do believe that the Senate and the people of Australia have the right to expect truthful statements to be made in this place. We do not know whether that is now the case because the person whose letter it is has now changed her explanation. It does therefore seem to be a legitimate issue for the Privileges Committee to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the judgment of Madam President that this debate should take precedence. There is an issue that the Privileges Committee can examine to see whether or not the Senate has been misled. But should the Privileges Committee be seeking to do that now when matters have been so overtaken by the police investigation? I would argue that it would be better for this debate to be taking place after the police matters have been resolved. If the police decide that there is nothing to pursue in terms of criminal breach against Senator Colston, the issue as to whether or not he has misled the Senate is still on the table and the Senate has every right to seek to have that resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not a convenient process for those who want to turn this into a political witch&hyphen;hunt. They want the committee to meet now for, as Mr Crean said, the purpose of seeking political advantage against the government. That is Labor's motivation in this. The opportunity to take what I think is the most correct course in this matter&mdash;which is to defer it until after police investigations are complete&mdash;is probably not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very least, what the Senate ought to be considering, particularly the Labor Party as it goes down this track of seeking political
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advantage from it, is the issue as to whether a Senate privileges inquiry may in some way prejudice that police investigation. The best advice from senior law officers of the land, with great respect to the Clerk of the Senate, is that it could prejudice that investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that a prudent Senate would not take a chance on that. A prudent Senate would say that it would be improper for it to take a course of action which may in some way prejudice the police inquiry and anything that would flow from that inquiry. I cannot see any argument against that position except an argument that is of political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say to the Australian Democrats and what I say to the Greens and what I say to Senator Harradine is, yes, if the Senate Privileges Committee wants to examine whether the Senate has been misled, that is fine, but it should do so after matters relating to the police investigation and anything that flows from it have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the advice we have got from Mr Burmeister. It is sensible advice for the Senate to follow. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment. I think I need to foreshadow it because it is inconsistent with the amendment put down by Senator Murray. My amendment will be in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the Committee of Privileges not commence its inquiry into this matter until a statement is provided in accordance with paragraph (3)</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">paragraph (1) restates Senator Faulkner's motion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicating that Australian Federal Police investigations of payments made to Senator Colston and any legal proceedings consequent on those investigations have been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That, for the purpose of paragraph (2), the Attorney&hyphen;General provide to the President, as soon as possible after the conclusion of such investigations and any such legal proceedings, a statement indicating that such investigations and any such legal proceedings have concluded, and the President immediately provide that statement to the Committee of Privileges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So yes, pass the motion handing this matter to the Privileges Committee, but the Senate should resolve that the privileges inquiry
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2809"> should not commence until all matters relating to these police investigations have been brought to finality. By adopting that process, the Senate would be able to preserve its integrity and work out whether these statements were untrue or otherwise, but we would not be acting in a way that would risk that police investigation and matters that would flow from it. I therefore put that proposition to the Senate as the proper way to resolve this matter in the interests of the public at large and for the future standing of this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of the Resolution of the Senate agreed to on the 25 February 1988, the President is required to have regard to only two criteria when determining if a matter of privilege should have precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first criterion requires that the issue for judgement should be of sufficient gravity that a substantial obstruction of the Senate or its committees could be held to have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second criterion requires that no other remedy for addressing the contempt exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Prime Facie Case:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the circumstances that require investigation by the Privileges Committee?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 March 1997 the President tabled in the Senate a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`Senator Colston&mdash;Travelling Allowance Documents Tabled by Madam President'.</EMPHASIS>  These documents consisted of various reports from Senate officials detailing irregular travel claims made by Senator Colston. They included an exchange of correspondence between the President and Senator Colston in relation to the timing of his response to the reports and they included two letters from Senator Colston explaining how the bogus claims occurred. They also included a statement by Mrs Christine Smith, a former office manager for Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his letter to the President of 24 March 1997 Senator Colston claimed that:
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"My investigations have discovered that the inadequate bookkeeping systems in my office led to administrative errors on the part of my office staff which caused the overpayments. I would regularly ask my office manager at the time for the dates of my travelling to place on my claims and I would transcribe those dates onto the claim form. In doing so I assumed that the dates which were given to me by my office manager were correct. In the course of my investigation, I have discovered that in numerous cases these dates were not correct."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston offered this explanation as the cause of overpayments on 19 occasions in that correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston wrote to the Clerk of the Senate on 24 March 1997 and offered the same explanation for the cause of travel allowance overpayments on a further six occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In support of this explanation Senator Colston caused to be tabled a statement signed by Mrs Christine Smith and dated 24 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this statement Mrs Smith confirmed that she acted as office manager for Senator Colston during the relevant period. She also stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"One of my duties during that time was to record the dates for which the Senator was eligible for travelling allowance".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She explained that the Senator often notified her of changes but stated that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I did not notify the transport office as required nor did I sometimes make adequate note of the changed travel arrangements. The only excuse that I have is that the pressures of work in the office made me put these matters to one side.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result was that on a number of occasions I gave the Senator an incorrect list of dates for his travelling allowance claims. The Senator accepted the dates I provided to him as being correct."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Smith's statement concluded:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I accept full responsibility for providing the wrong dates to Senator Colston for transcription to his travel allowance claims."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate has advised that these documents, having been presented to the Senate, were published in accordance with Standing Order 167. They are therefore proceedings in parliament within the meaning of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which applies article nine of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bill of Rights 1688</EMPHASIS>  to the Parliament of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore common ground that these statements are unimpeachable in any court or tribunal or any other place outside of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 8 April 1997 Mrs Smith supplied to the President and the Clerk of the Senate additional infor
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2810"> mation relating to her earlier statement of the 24 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She stated that she wished to withdraw her earlier statement and replace it with a statement that declared, amongst other things,:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Both the Senator and I were aware at this time that in fact the mistakes were not mine as it was not part of my duties to provide the Senator with information for his TA claims, nor did I ever provide claims on his behalf."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She stated that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I asked the Senator whether the statement had in fact already been typed, because I had not done it, and he said words to the effect of `yes, Douglas has been working all weekend'."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She continued:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I now wish to advise that my statement was incorrect. I was not responsible for preparing the Senator's Travelling Allowance claims nor required to keep a record of dates of travel for TA purposes. The Senator always prepared his own claims."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston has rejected the assertions contained within Mrs Smith's second statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whichever statement or statements is to be believed, misleading evidence has been provided to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the second statement provided by Mrs Christine Smith, both Senator Colston and Mrs Smith knowingly provided misleading statements to the Senate on 24 March 1997. Further, Mrs Christine Smith's second statement asserts that a member of Senator Colston's staff, Douglas Colston, was responsible for drafting her first statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has always regarded the provision of misleading information to itself or one of its committees as one of the most serious matters of privilege that can be raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is surely no less serious when a Senator himself knowingly causes misleading information to be presented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt therefore that the requirements of the first criterion have been satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other remedies:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the arguments about the scope of the AFP investigation and its impact on a Senate inquiry one fact is clear. The AFP, or any court, will never be able to produce or test those statements attracting absolute parliamentary privilege. This was the point made by the Clerk of the Senate in his letter to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on 22 April 1997. He stated that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The significant feature of the statements by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith is not that they were published by the Senate but that they were created for the purpose of submission to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate (the President having stated that she would present them to the Senate on their receipt by her) and they therefore have no prior or independent existence apart from the Senate's inquiry."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On at least six occasions in recent years the President has granted precedence and the Senate has referred matters to the Privileges Committee based on allegations of misleading evidence provided by witnesses to Senate committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On none of those occasions was the evidence so substantial or the gravity so clear as this. On no occasions was the information provided directly to the Senate and on no occasion was a Senator directly accused of responsibility for actually preparing the misleading information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The AFP investigation:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, it is not surprising that the Government, the Opposition, the Democrats and the Greens all agree that a case has been established to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is rather one of timing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney General asked the Chief General Counsel of his Department, Mr Henry Burmester, to provide advice on the difficulties that an inquiry by the Senate Privileges Committee might create for the investigation in progress by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his advice the Chief General Counsel acknowledged the broad definition given to proceedings in parliament by section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. His advice acknowledged the severe limitations that are attached to the use of documents that constitute parliamentary proceedings. He stated that the Act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . significantly limits the ability to question a person about the veracity of anything forming part of parliamentary proceedings, and from questioning the credibility, motive, intentions, or good faith of a person, or drawing inferences or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of those proceedings in parliament."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burmester then conceded the vital point&mdash;nothing prevents either Senator Colston or Mrs Christine Smith from giving their accounts of the circumstances surrounding the bogus travel Claims to any inquiry or court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But only the Senate can conduct an investigation into whether a contempt has occurred as a consequence of the tabling and publication of the documents presented by the President on 24 March 1997. These are two distinct and exclusive issues. As the Clerk stated in his advice:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Senate would inquire into the truthfulness of the statements made to it by Senator Colston and Mrs Smith and whether a contempt was committed by the making of false statements.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2811"> This question cannot be the subject of any legal proceedings. . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burmester's advice conceded that the vital issue was the scope of any proposed Senate inquiry&mdash;he conceded that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is a matter for judgement whether a Senate inquiry into these matters could in fact be confined in a way that did not trespass more broadly into matters the current subject of criminal investigation"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic point remains&mdash;an inquiry into the truthfulness or otherwise of the statements presented to the Senate is based on evidence that only the Senate can access and therefore issues that only the Senate can assess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Opposition's position is not an unreasonable one. We believe that the terms of a proposed inquiry can best be developed through a conference of Senate Party Leaders to ensure that the inquiry is focussed only on the issues that can potentially represent a clear breach of Senate privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We invite the Attorney General to nominate an officer from his department to monitor the Committee's deliberations and provide advice in the event that the AFP investigation is to be affected in any way by the Committee's inquiry. If a matter that is the subject of the AFP investigation is to be materially canvassed then the inquiry should cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of a Privileges Committee inquiry is not to duplicate or `shadow' any AFP investigation. Rather, it is to inquire into and, if necessary, provide a sanction for, matters which have no other potential remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privileges Committee has a history of dealing appropriately with these types of issues. Matters relating to breaches of Senate privilege are, by their nature, sensitive. In my experience the Committee has always behaved cooperatively and sensibly&mdash;I see no reason why that would not continue to occur in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Chair of the Privileges Committee:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators would be aware of my role both as Chair of the Privileges Committee and as a Senator who has been outspoken on many of the issues relating to Senator Colston. I therefore consider it appropriate to stand aside from the Chairmanship of the Privileges Committee should it conduct an inquiry into matters relating to Senator Colston. I also intend to stand aside from the inquiry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received advice from the Clerk that I can be replaced by another senator for the purposes of any inquiry into Senator Colston while continuing to be a member of the Committee for other work&mdash;including other inquiries. According to standing orders the Committee would elect an opposition Senator as chair.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 April 1997, Senator Vanstone stated that she would not like to see a conscience vote on this issue. She twice rejected the notion and asked rhetorically "Why should there be?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, when the Senate debated a matter of privilege in August 1990 relating to information supplied by the Department of Defence on the use of asbestos by the Royal Australian Navy, I commented:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no problem with a party vote on matters of privilege. But let's have some consistency. If it is to be the case that in future matters of privilege are to be party votes on all occasions, let's set the ground rules now.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years we have seen a proliferation of seminars and publications advising public servants on their legal obligations when giving evidence before Senate committees.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we refuse to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee we should be clear on one point. The Senate will have no credibility with public servants or other classes of witnesses if we refuse to investi

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been much talk recently about the effect that this matter has had on the standing of the Parliament and of all Senators and Members. Whatever shabby&mdash;excuse the Senate finds not to cause this matter to be investigated the real effect will be to reveal to the Australian public that a double standard applies&mdash;that the Senate is unwilling to apply the rules that it insists upon for public servants and the rest of the community to senators themselves. That is what will diminish the Senate further. In effect the Senate would be turning the Resolution of the 25th February 1988 on its head. Through not investigating the matter we would be ensuring that no one else could either&mdash;there would in effect be no remedy for any untruthful statements tabled in relation to this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real question is: is it possible for a co&hyphen;joint Privileges Committee inquiry and police inquiry and would their inquiries overlap and conflict? The answer to that is both yes and no. With a properly run privileges inquiry, with proper caveats, it would be possible to have an inquiry into the contempt matter at the same time as a police inquiry. But it also should be acknowledged that a badly run
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry, a poorly advised inquiry, does have the potential to interfere with the police inquiries. The Labor Party takes the view that under no circumstances should the police inquiries be interfered with. But we reject the coalition's assertion that such overlapping and interference is inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two amendments before the chair. One is by Senator Murray, which asks for the Privileges Committee itself to weigh up these legal opinions and report back to the Senate. In fact, a resolution from the Senate will then be required, as to whether the inquiry proceeds. It is a fairly reasonable proposition, made more reasonable by my colleague when he put the reporting date out by an extra couple of weeks, which would at least allow members of the Privileges Committee to give some considered view to put to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill's proposed amendment states that there should be absolutely, categorically no inquiries until all police and potential court matters are resolved. I would have thought that was a better motion to move in two or three weeks time, when the Privileges Committee has looked at all these matters and reported back to the Senate. Then Senator Hill could put that particular motion, if it was still his view. It would have been a much more reasonable approach in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the prima facie case has been established; the only debate is about timing. I want to make this point, as I did in my letter: the Privileges Committee has had something like 29 references in the last seven or eight years, nearly all associated with misleading evidence&mdash;not by senators, but by public servants and the public. How can we look them straight in the face and say, `Hold on, we're going to investigate all of you, but when one of our own may potentially have committed a sin, we're going to expiate that immediately'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain matters that have to be dealt with here from Senator Hill's contribution. Firstly, he says this is a political exercise. There have been aspects to the Colston affair that have been political; there is no question about that. But there is no way, under this reference, as Senator Faulkner has termed, that the Senate Privileges Committee
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2813"> could look at any deal between the government and Senator Colston. It is not in the terms of reference and no chairman or no member of the Privileges Committee would allow the inquiry to stray into those areas. But Senator Hill said, `Mr Crean said so and so.' Yes, a member of the House of Representatives, not understanding the Senate procedures, said that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How did he get it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, how did he get the advice? The reason is that they had to pull Senator Hill out of the batting order; they did not want him exposed to any questions on this. Senator Alston was left out of it; they did not want him to be asked any questions on it. Also, they just completely ignored the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). So you have some mundane suburban solicitor running the government's case from the House of Representatives, arguing that we did not have the right in the Senate to determine whether this matter goes to the Privileges Committee and is heard. That is the level to which the coalition had to stoop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say to all those in the House of Representatives&mdash;Mr Crean, Mr Reith and all the rest of them&mdash;butt out. This is Senate business. It is a potential contempt of the Senate that we are looking at and it is, frankly, none of their business. I hope, equally, that none of us ever proceed to try to interfere with privileges matters that occur in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the situation of Senator Hill coming in here and talking about the rules of natural justice. I did point out yesterday, in a question to Senator Hill, that this is a remarkable conversion. It was only in 1994&hyphen;95 that he let all his senators off the leash to ask operational police matters in this chamber, in the estimates committee and in the select committee on radioactive waste. They were
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like pigs in mud there. They had great fun there asking all sorts of questions. But suddenly, when they make the 10&hyphen;metre journey to the other side, natural justice comes forward as an argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they really believed in natural justice and in the presumption of innocence, why have they stripped the former Deputy President of his position? Haven't they judged him? In the panic press conference, when Mr Howard demanded that he give up the post, was that not bringing a judgment down on Senator Colston? And when the opinion polls came out and the slide continued and the cabinet discussion occurred and the Grahame Morris solution came forth that they would never accept Senator Colston's vote again, wasn't that a slight infringement on the presumption of innocence? Of course it was. They are very happy to presume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have to ask the question: why has the coalition been so paranoid about this matter going to the Privileges Committee? The first reason was given by Senator Hill today. He might have had every reason, with justice, to be paranoid about it. He says he thought that this committee would look at the deal. I am telling him now it will not and it was never going to. So that removes that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, from the questions asked yesterday in the chamber, we now know why the coalition do not want this to go to the Privileges Committee. They probably do not want immediate evidence from Mrs Smith as to what her discussions with Senator Alston were. They do not want any input by this government into Mrs Smith's or Senator Colston's statements, which were put down in this chamber on 24 March, cross&hyphen;examined and put in the evidence. I think it is there you will find the sudden creation of the natural justice argument as a smokescreen to hide their own political hides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Senator Hill has run out the old chestnuts today. He says, `Look at 1983.' He was here in 1981 and 1982, but political amnesia has hit him: he cannot recall the fact that the first offences by Senator Colston were under the Fraser government. He cannot recall the fact that the first discovery was under the Fraser government. He cannot recall the fact
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2814"> that it was a Liberal minister, Mr Newman, that allowed Senator Colston to repay the money. All we have from Mr Newman is, `I would have liked it to have gone to the Federal Police.' There is no evidence of that. None of those documents have been released to the opposition to sustain or support that particular point of view. But they forget that. They conveniently forget that the first offences occurred under the Fraser government and were discovered under the Fraser government, and that administrative means were used to repay that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the cheek of someone like Senator Knowles, who came in here yesterday and said that we were cabinet ministers and we should have known. Let me say to you, Senator Knowles, that in 1982 the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was a member of cabinet. Why didn't he know about Senator Colston's matters?</PARA>

Even though the presidency went to government and the deputy presidency went to opposition, there were always ballots for these positions. Senator Colston put his hand up and said, `I'll be the sacrificial lamb and run for the deputy presidency.' He was endorsed in about late March or April to run for that position. Remember, the position does not come up until August. What happened in the meantime was that you had not selected a candidate on the other side there. You then selected Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne. So it was going to be a run off between Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne and Senator Colston. We obviously assumed we were going to lose.

In terms of what Senator Hill has to say about 1990, he does it totally without knowledge of the history of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2815">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the transparency on these matters. We had Senator Hill get up on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and say that this should not go to the Privileges Committee but, `I have to face question time,' he says, with a furrow on his brow. `I have to face intense questioning at estimates committee.' But when we ask him about the details of meetings he says, `I'm not going to reveal that.' When we ask him whether there was a deal he says, `I answered those questions last year.' But when you look up the answers from last year they are non&hyphen;answers. There is no transparency in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need, I think, for this government to come clean. It should reveal what discussions they had with Senator Colston leading up to his defection in August last year. They should say what discussions they had with Mrs Smith with regard to the statement that she made. They should put those things on the record. If they do, then some of the conspiracy theories may get deflated and some may in fact get sustained over time. But there has been throughout this a lack of transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They finally talk about, `Aren't we goody&hyphen;two&hyphen;shoes? We sent this off to the Federal Police.' Have a look at the circumstances in which they sent it off. They said time and time again before 8 April, `We'll let matters take their course.' They put extended reporting dates by Senator Colston back to protect him. They did everything possible to protect him. Then suddenly, on 8 April, the following sequence of events occurs: Mr Douglas B. Colston finds out that Mrs Smith is going to retract her statement. He informs his father, Senator Colston, who then rings Senator Alston, who then rings the office of the Prime Minister, and a panic starts. They desperately try to get hold of a copy of the recantation. Quite properly, Madam President, it was not handed over by the parliamentary side to the executive, and you came up&mdash;it must have been pretty good&mdash;at 4 o'clock in the morning with a very clever move: `Send it out to all the party leaders, and that's a way of getting it out.' I congratulate you for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the panic is on. They were desperately trying to get hold of a copy of this recantation. Eventually, they get hold of a copy and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at about 8.20 they give notice of a press conference for 9 o'clock that night. These are the circumstances in which it went to the Federal Police. It was not a considered decision, not a rational decision, not a moral or principled position but absolute political panic before it got sent across. They worry that even the press conference may not go ahead, because it was slotted for 9 o'clock and they are having trouble analysing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They even have to pull the Prime Minister's doormat out of Falstaff or whatever the show was to get his legal opinion. I can tell you the reason they did that. Senator Alston was in fact the agent who ran Senator Colston, and he was a vital part of it. That is why he refuses to comment on how many phone calls he has made to Senator Colston and why he has had Senator Colston in his office so often. But he cannot even remember this person. He cannot even remember why he went to Senator Colston's office in mid&hyphen;March. Here you have the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate making the long walk around to the office of the Deputy President to discuss something with him and he cannot even recall the subject matter. He does not know why he is in that office. We have the deputy leader of the coalition in this place wandering around the building not knowing where he is or what he is doing. There is some other evidence for that. He has wandered around, missed divisions and booked overseas trips not even knowing where he is going or what he is doing.</PARA>

He has some vague recollection of meeting Mrs Smith and off he wanders, apparently back to his own office. He has shown no transparency in his activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Faulkner reminded us, the most degrading moment in my time in the Senate was to watch Senator Alston make the walk right over here during a division, tap Senator Colston on his shoulder and tell him to come
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2816"> to the other side. Then, panting like Fido, he followed Senator Alston across to the other side of the chamber. That was absolutely humiliating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset of this debate, the only question before this parliament and this chamber at the moment appears to be that of timing, in which I think there are valid arguments going both ways. We restate our position that we do not believe there would necessarily be a clash between the Privileges Committee and the police inquiry. We say that, if there is a clash, the Privileges Committee could not proceed with its inquiries, but we say that that clash is not inevitable. We say, with proper advice, conjoint inquiries can be run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the amendments, Senator Murray's really asks for a more considered view to be established and put back to this chamber with the ultimate decision to be made in that chamber. We accept that point of view put forward by Senator Murray. We think Senator Hill's amendment is more appropriate to be put when that Senate Privileges Committee report comes back to this chamber. He would still have a legitimate opportunity to put his delay mechanism in place at that time, on the 29th, or whenever that report is considered. Of course, what they basically want to do is to say, effectively, `If we can put it off now, there'll never be an inquiry.' If they have a belief that the police inquiry and any potential court cases will take a couple of years, this is something they can just push off forever. Therein lies the motivation, in part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other motivation is that they desperately do not want any cross&hyphen;examination as to what role they may have had&mdash;I am not asserting that they did have&mdash;in the construction of the Smith&hyphen;Colston defence that appeared here on 24 March. They desperately don't want that. As I said before, as for Senator Hill's paranoia about this inquiry going broader into political deals, I can put his mind at ease. That is not the intention of senators. Mr Crean said that. He was in error, the same as Mr Reith was in error, in his comments on this particular matter. This is a matter to be determined in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Robert Ray talks a lot about transparency. The one thing that we could not accuse Senator Robert Ray of since the beginning of the first session is a lack of transparency because, quite frankly, Senator Ray's efforts in trying to make sure that Senator Colston is brought down have been very transparent. You have even admitted that it is a vendetta, that nobody rats on the Labor Party and that you will go to the ends of the earth to make sure that you get your man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also accuse this government of a lack of transparency. Senator Carr interjected earlier, `What about 1982?' You also said, `What about 1982?' It is a fact that the Minister for Administrative Services in 1982, Mr Kevin Newman, has confirmed in recent times that nearly $4,200 was repaid. He has also said that he wanted to call the police in but that he had advice from DAS that there was no legal cause to do so. He believes that at the time he told the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Hayden, and the Acting Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Neil Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about a lack of transparency, but compare that with what happened in 1983 when advice was given that the matter should be referred to the Federal Police. And yet the Attorney&hyphen;General at the time, Gareth Evans, only recently on 6 April went on that program to defend the manner in which the Labor government had handled the Colston matter in 1983. Where was the transparency then? Where was the need to make things public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former senator Gareth Evans even had the gall to say that Labor had no problem with reopening the investigations because it happened at the time Senator Colston was a young mistake maker. `A young mistake maker' was the term used by former senator Gareth Evans when referring to Senator Colston when he already knew in 1982 that money had been repaid and there was a request for the Australian Federal Police to investigate a matter. But he was a young mistake maker. He was a young mistake maker: he had been in the Senate for only eight years at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be right, Senator Forshaw. You have been here for only three or four, so you
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2817"> can make mistakes for the next three or four years and you will only be a young mistake maker. I am not suggesting you would make mistakes, of course, but your colleagues have been here for less than eight years; they can make these sorts of mistakes. Former Senator Evans would not refer anything to the police if you did, because if you have been here only eight years you are only a young mistake maker. Against all advice, the government of the day showed a complete lack of transparency and kept the matter under wraps to make sure that the public did not have any idea of what was happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then that same Senator Gareth Evans was prepared in 1990 to support Senator Colston for the deputy presidency. Senator Ray says that he himself was not in possession of that knowledge and that if he had been he would not have supported him. I believe Senator Ray. Senator Ray has proved in this place to be an honest man, but your former leader in this place, then Senator Gareth Evans, in 1990 knew and had to know. And I remain to be convinced that there were not other people in the Labor Party who knew that in 1983 in particular, and even possibly in 1982, Senator Colston had been forced to repay money because of misclaiming of travelling allowances. That is the sort of person you put up to be Deputy President, and you then criticise this government for supporting him as Deputy President when they were not in possession of any of those facts as to what occurred in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Ray and Senator Hill when they say that the matters that have been raised may be matters that the Privileges Committee should consider. But it is all a matter of timing, and we just happen to disagree as to when that should take place. I support the amendment that has been foreshadowed by Senator Hill that we should let the police investigation take its course and, at the conclusion of that police investigation, the Senate should then decide whether or not there is a matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee and a case to answer as to whether or not there has been contempt of the Senate or in some other way there has been a breach of privilege of the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally appropriate to allow the Australian Federal Police to finalise their investigation without being hampered in any way whatsoever and at the conclusion of that for this Senate to then decide whether there is a case to answer or whether there is a matter that should be determined by the Privileges Committee, taking into account anything that may have happened as a result of the Federal Police investigation that is currently taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, I hold you in high regard&mdash;I have seen many of your contributions at committee level&mdash;but let me say that I think today's effort when you moved your amendment was rather pathetic.

Senator Faulkner trotted out the usual diatribe that we have heard day after day on this matter and a repeat of previous things that were said and have been said since February, which do little to advance the argument that was being put forward as to the urgency of this matter going to the Privileges Committee right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner's effort to expand the inquiry&mdash;and it is obviously the intent, despite what Senator Ray says&mdash;beyond Senator Colston's alleged travelling rorts would result in something that is difficult to control because, once the matter gets before the Privileges Committee, there are lots of other things and extraneous matters, I am quite sure, that will be debated, as happens in other committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say, from the initial efforts of Senator Ray in particular but also of Senator Faulkner to expose alleged rorting of allowances by Senator Colston, that events have overtaken their original intent, which was by any means at their disposal to get rid of Senator Colston both as Deputy President and as a member of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Events have overtaken that. The matters that have been raised by them have been dealt with in ways that have been described by Senator Hill and others. Those events have led to an investigation by the Australian Federal Police. I think it is important for us to remember that that investigation by the Federal Police should take precedence now that it has been asked for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has called in the Federal Police and it should be allowed to go on unhindered. It should be allowed to take its natural course. At the end of that time, this Senate will still have the opportunity to decide, bearing in mind the results of the police inquiry, whether or not there is a case to be referred to the Privileges Committee. That is the time that these matters, if neces
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sary, should be dealt with by the Privileges Committee and not before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter how often we hear Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner repeating events of the past. Many events have come to light, of course, which they did not care to mention in the earlier stages of this debate over these particular allegations, but I want to put it on the record that their total lack of transparency in earlier times belies their intention at this stage to try to bring forward matters for the purposes of transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they were in government they had no interest other than protecting one of their own. Once that person who was their own defected and resigned from their party, they then had no other intention other than to destroy that person who chose to resign from the Labor Party. Their intention has been quite obvious since the beginning of February&mdash;carefully planned, carefully stage managed so that, day after day, these matters were brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now reached the stage with the introduction of a Federal Police inquiry where this Senate should allow that Federal Police inquiry to continue. It should allow it to complete its findings. Once it has made its findings public, this Senate should then decide whether or not there are still outstanding matters that should be referred to the Privileges Committee for their deliberation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here today really deciding, firstly, whether there is going to be action and, secondly, how quickly that action is to be taken. That is the matter before us. We must keep the public in mind and not just sectional political interest within this Senate chamber in dealing with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question here is whether the Privileges Committee, by looking into whether or not the Senate has been misled by statements from Senator Colston and Mrs Smith, is going to infringe on a police inquiry which is looking at whether or not fraudulent claims were made by Senator Colston. I agree with Senator Robert Ray that the Privileges Committee has the nous and the wherewithal to proceed carefully enough so that it does not infringe upon the police inquiry and does not hamper or curtail the police inquiry into whether or not fraudulent claims were made by Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that three weeks from now we are simply going to have a report back from the Privileges Committee, if Senator Murray's amendment is carried&mdash;and I think it will be carried&mdash;which is going to leave this matter no clearer than it is now. It is simply going to be a case of duelling legal opinions. Therefore, I would favour the motion jointly put forward by Senator Margetts and Senator Bolkus being adopted by the Senate this morning and carried into effect so that the Privileges Committee can get on with the business of determining who misled the Senate. That is the matter at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In determining whether or not we are going to get that far, we have to look at the government's proposed amendment. Senator Ferguson, who spoke before me, asserted that it would be a good thing if we waited until after the police inquiry before the Privileges Committee looked into who has misled this Senate&mdash;was it Senator Colston or was it Mrs Smith. But that is not what the government's amendment does. It says, `Let's not have Senate action to look into that matter until after the police inquiry and any consequent court proceedings.' That in my book means forever. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government amendment is passed, forget a Privileges Committee inquiry into who misled the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is critical that we do go to the heart of that matter, that we do find out whether it was Senator Colston or Mrs Smith, and only the Privileges Committee can determine that matter. Therefore, it is imperative that the two inquiries proceed in parallel with the Privileges Committee taking all due caution, otherwise we will have a de facto miscarriage of justice by no justice being done at all in the matter of the misleading of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not underestimate that. It is fundamental, as Senator Margetts has said, for good government and for good government being seen to be done and for the sterling representation of the people of Australia that this matter be clarified and that, if people in high office mislead this place, that be discovered and those people be dealt with appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pivotal to some of the votes that are going to occur in this matter will be the votes of the Independents themselves&mdash;Senator Colston and Senator Harradine. With their votes, the government has the numbers. Incumbent upon those two senators is a very high responsibility in how they vote today on this motion, the amendment and the foreshadowed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston has indicated that he will vote against the government as a matter of procedure. It will be very testing indeed to see whether he will vote against a government amendment that has been put here today and, therefore, against what may be seen as his own interests. I do not know. I reckon that it would be extraordinarily untoward were he to vote on the matter at all because of the self-interest that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Madam President, I have been punctual in drawing the Senate's attention to the relevant section of the rules which says that if we are dealing with a matter in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2820"> which we have a personal stake at least we must declare that stake to the Senate, even though there is no means to prevent a vote being taken. There is a very high responsibility on Senator Colston to consider whether he should vote at all in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine is also in a very difficult position. It appears to me that Senator Harradine has been deceived to some degree by Senator Colston. We must remember that in August last year, when Senator Colston won the deputy presidency, it was Senator Harradine who was a chief advocate for him winning that position. Indeed, Senator Harradine spoke to me about the good attributes of Senator Colston in his run for the position of Deputy President. That did not win my vote on the occasion. But Senator Harradine took on the Labor Party over the matter. He said that they had a problem on their hands&mdash;a matter that they ought to look at with some degree of honour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, for Senator Harradine, it appears now that the reverse is true and that there is an enormous test of his own honour in ensuring that Senator Colston's affairs are properly investigated, discovered and dealt with by both the Senate and the police, without infringement on the police inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it a matter of great sadness that Senator Harradine, in 21 years of working with Senator Colston in this place&mdash;and I had the presumption that no-one knew him better than Senator Harradine&mdash;in fact knew nothing of the apparent past infractions of Senator Colston. Indeed, Senator Harradine said last year that he looked forward to working with Senator Colston in his role as Deputy President of the Senate and as a fellow Independent and said, `We have actually doubled our numbers overnight.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine was the primary advocate for Senator Colston taking this high office. Apparently, Senator Harradine had no knowledge whatever of the past behaviour of Senator Colston. I find it tremendously sad that that can be the situation, that in such a long and distinguished career as that which Senator Harradine has had he was nevertheless not able to pick up on what was happening to a fellow senator for whom he had
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become chief advocate. That is a matter of history now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assert again that there is an enormous weight of responsibility on both Independent senators as to how they vote. This must not be a political matter. This is a matter of fair action, of establishing proper behaviour and of resetting the standards of parliament in the eyes of the Australian electorate. It is hugely important. It must not be just a matter of political ping&hyphen;pong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that expedition and prudence are called for. I support the motion before the Senate. I would prefer that Senator Murray's amendment did not delay this action, but it is going to. Maybe that will have a good outcome; it certainly is not in any way meant to do other than ensure a better outcome&mdash;and I accept that, Senator Murray. I may well live to very soon congratulate you on assuring that we went the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I totally oppose the amendment flagged by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). All it will do is ensure that the Privileges Committee never meets during the term of this parliament to discover who has deceived the Senate and, effectively, who has deliberately, I believe, set out to deceive the people of Australia in a matter of great importance. That would be the worst of all outcomes. I would inveigle the government to withdraw that amendment. But, if it is put and comes to a vote, there is a very heavy responsibility on the Independent senators to see that it does not pass this morning.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to deal with a matter raised by Senator Ray since he has circulated his letter. It relates to the matter of whether this is a free vote or whether it is a party vote.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2821"> through the files for the last 13-odd years, I find several references. On 2 October 1984 Senator Georges says, `I am moving a motion which indicates that I have got a free vote.' He was a Labor Party senator. In April 1986 Senator Gareth Evans says: `The government has taken the view that matters of privilege are not party matters but traditionally free vote matters.' On 24 February 1988 there is another such statement by Senator Evans. On 25 February 1988 there is a statement to that effect by Senator Puplick, for the Liberal Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyway, put that aside. That is the reason why I am addressing this matter. To say that sometimes a party vote has been used misrepresents the situation in so far as there are clearly issues; one that comes to mind was the reference of the former Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, to the committee and quite obviously the Liberal Party had a united view on it. We did not have to caucus in any way at all to see that as a matter of such gravity that it should be referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the substance of the motion before this us this morning. I have no disagreement at all that we have a prima facie case here for the Senate to investigate. Certain allegations were made about travel allowances. One senator submitted an explanation. A staff member of that senator submitted a corroborating statement. Some time later a statement which was in conflict with the corroborating statement was submitted by the staff member. Clearly, there is a conflict of evidence put before the Senate. Both parties cannot be right, or the same person cannot be right on two separate occasions. So we certainly have to determine where the truth lies in this matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is hard to have a matter of graver importance to the parliament than the veracity of witnesses and evidence given to it. We accept in committees when we are holding public hearings that, even if a witness is not sworn on a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> or takes an oath of affirmation, the evidence they give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The Parliamentary Privileges Act reflects that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We similarly demand of ministers that they tell the truth. In fact, we go further than that. The parliament would be unworkable if ministers in question time had a licence to fabricate the truth. As Senator Faulkner knows very well, they do tell the truth. What they do not do is tell the whole truth. They tell a small amount of the truth. But again, they are very cautious not to mislead. The practice before the Senate is that people do not mislead, and that is a much wider ambit than the charge of lying, of telling falsehoods. That illustrates the gravity with which the Senate takes the matter of truth before it. So there is no argument at all that we have a prima facie case here of contempt before the Senate, and that is a matter which must be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question which the Senate is wrestling with at the moment is the matter of timing. I have two concerns about this. My primary concern, and the concern which overwhelms everything else, is the fact that investigations are now under way on a matter of criminal action. That is a very grave charge. It is quite different as to whether a minister has made a misleading statement to the parliament. It is quite different to evidence being given to a committee. We are dealing here with criminal matters. I believe in the separation of powers. I do not believe that the parliament is the court and the judiciary. I think that we make the laws. It is for other bodies to investigate the application. When we move beyond civil actions into criminal actions then we have to approach our interference at that point with a great deal of gravity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is the matter of the perversion of justice. Since it is not our primary objective to be a court, then the actions of the Senate must be very carefully
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2822"> judged so that we do not pervert the course of justice. That is my primary concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My secondary concern relates to the politics of the situation. No-one in this chamber today would claim that this was not an intensely partisan political exercise. I have grave doubts about the outcome because of the emotionalism that surrounds the matter in the run-up to the legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly not known as a rabid, partisan political dogfighter. My credentials, I would hope, as a Liberal are beyond dispute. I do not have to defend my political philosophy. I do not become involved in the more passionate and mindless debates on matters of political dogma. But I am very concerned about the way the politics of this are being handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement of Mr Crean at the weekend where he was clearly pursuing Senator Hill and Senator Alston as a primary objective of a privileges inquiry is clearly a statement of political intent. It is not a question of determining the justice of the situation or the truth of the matter in any way at all; it is a witch&hyphen;hunt. I accept unreservedly that Senator Hill and Senator Alston acted with complete probity in this matter. While I admire Senator Ray immensely&mdash;I think he is worth the rest of the Labor Party put together with respect to his political skills and his stature as a parliamentarian&mdash;Senator Ray's initial attack on Senator Colston was clearly a partisan political attack of a magnitude that I have never seen in nearly 20 years in this chamber. I have never seen a person attacked with the ferocity with which Senator Ray went for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it impossible to believe that Senator Ray is not speaking alone on that, that his views are not shared by the rest of the Labor Party. Whether he is chairing the committee or sitting on the sidelines to me is irrelevant. So I have very grave fears about the objectivity of an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, from my own side, that, if it went to an inquiry, I would be very surprised if it could be confined to the terms of reference and not turn into a political dogfight, which would lead us nowhere at all. Quite clearly, the Liberal Party would want to know
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the truth about the allegations we have seen about all the years of the Labor administration. We have had evidence, which has never been refuted, that the head of the Department of Administrative Services advised a minister of the Labor government that police inquiries should have been instituted and that that advice was overruled. We saw the allegations when two staff members&mdash;I think in 1992 and 1994&mdash;wrote to the Department of Administrative Services complaining about irregularities in the way Senator Colston made some claims on the department, and those complaints were squashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a matter of concern for the Liberal Party to check those things out. So I do not see that there is very much chance that, in the present climate, you can proceed with an impartial inquiry restricted entirely to the matter as to which of those two parties I was referring to at the outset misled the Senate. That is not a political matter. That is a matter of fact that we have to determine. It is a matter of contempt of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like, in public, to put a hypothetical case for the Senate to consider. If Senator Colston, as a consequence of these police inquiries, is charged and if he is convicted, then it follows logically that the ministers of the former Labor government&mdash;Beazley, Evans, Bolkus and Walker&mdash;should also have their day in court under section 44 of the Crimes Act because they would have a case to answer that they conspired in a defrauding of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having reviewed the whole matter, I think our primary concern is the administration of justice within this chamber. I think that you must come to the conclusion, at the end of the day, that the criminal proceedings must proceed, and proceed in a fair and impartial manner without any perversion from partisan politics in the Senate today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments, mainly because Senator Ferguson misrepresented Senator Murray's comments on the matter of transparency. Senator Ferguson spent a great deal of his contribution focusing on the transparency of past actions and heavily
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2823"> emphasising what he sees as the failure of previous Labor ministers to be honest about the advice they were given by bureaucrats and to act on that advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ferguson was critical of Senator Murray's comments which linked the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with the failure of the House of Representatives to take action to table information on their own entitlements. That is what Senator Murray said. He said that it is wrong to insist on transparency in one house of parliament and to avoid the issue in the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Independent member for Calare (Mr Andren) has asked for that information to be tabled and the Senate has sent a request that the House of Representatives table the same summaries of travel allowances, dates and moneys paid in the way it has been tabled and is tabled annually here in the Senate. But the House of Representatives, for obvious reasons, has declined to answer that request. I think that is wrong. It is not only senators who have these entitlements, it is not only senators who carry out their duties to their constituents according to the guidelines set down, and it should not only be senators who are scrutinised, to the exclusion of other members of parliament. That is the point Senator Murray was making. He was simply saying that he would have thought the Prime Minister may have shown some leadership by requiring the House of Representatives to table the same information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you could put another construction on it, and I will do that. I actually think it is part of the longer term coalition agenda to wallow a little in the odium that is attached to the Senate at the moment via Senator Colston because of what we have seen revealed in the past few days about desires to change the Senate voting system. I do not know how Australians feel about this, but I cannot bear the way in which the sides have changed over, the faces are different, but the script is the same. When you are in government and you do not like the scrutiny of the house of review, you want to change it; you want to change the rules, you want to go back to the days when the Senate was a rubber stamp. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the politics of this are very interesting. The focus on the Senate exclusively, while we might all protest about it, actually serves a more devious political purpose for this coalition government in its longer term anti&hyphen;Senate campaign, and I want to take a moment to draw attention to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not much has been said by government speakers about the legal advice, and that is why I want to look at Senator Murray's amendment. The Australian Democrats want to give no comfort at all to Senator Colston and no way at all in which he can avoid the scrutiny of the Privileges Committee about his actions and the actions of Mrs Christine Smith. But it is the same situation that we face here on many occasions. We have some legal advice proffered by the opposition and we have competing legal advice proffered by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only been here seven years, but my experience is that legal advice proffered by governments is very often written to the government's brief. That is why I think it is much better to give the Privileges Committee the opportunity to take both those pieces of advice and get some other advice on whether their actions in instigating a committee inquiry there and then prejudice further action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all Senator Murray's amendment seeks to do. It says that by all means we want the Privileges Committee to get on with this matter, but let us make sure that we first assess the potential risk that such an inquiry may present to any legal proceedings and let the committee recommend whether the inquiry should proceed and bring it back to the Senate by 29 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point in that is, I think, that it is a much better motion than the motion foreshadowed by Senator Hill which, as other speakers have said, is a great way of taking us to the next election, perhaps in the hope that you may get Senator Colston's vote back in the meantime. It is unacceptable, if you are serious about the reputation and the integrity of the Senate, to say that we cannot do anything about looking into the misleading of the Senate until the end of all consequent court action. If Senator Colston were to be charged and were to be found guilty and were  to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2824"> appeal, you can be certain this would take us beyond the next election date, and that is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just conclude by saying that, while we wish to proceed to the Privileges Committee inquiry, we must make sure that we do not act in such haste that we actually do not jeopardise ways by which Senator Colston is saved from the consequences of his actions. It is better to have a couple of extra weeks now, give the Privileges Committee the opportunity to get the range of advice, bring it back to the Senate and act on that. I am sorry there is a bit of a delay because I know the Australian people want us to get on with this, but we must make sure we do not cut off our nose to spite our face. I think that is really important. No extra protection, just a little certainty on the basis on which we are proceeding. That is why the Democrats have moved this amendment, although we have great sympathy with the opposition motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, you have quite properly, I believe, given precedence to a matter of privilege. This clearly is a matter of privilege on the face of it, as has been acknowledged around this chamber. There is a prima facie case for the matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee. I think around the chamber there is agreement as to what the next question is: when should this be dealt with by the Privileges Committee? That is the issue that we have before us today, I believe. The motion itself would enable the matter to continue immediately and to be dealt with by the Privileges Committee. The motion assumes that the Privileges Committee will meet immediately to deal with the matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, I am just wondering whether the movers of the motion have considered whether or not at this particular stage it would be sensitive to involve Mrs Smith, from whom we have a letter, in the painful job, I suppose, of appearing before the Privileges Committee, because I assume that Mrs Smith will be requested to appear before the Privileges Committee. I am not in the position to know whether or not she would wish this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter to be before the Privileges Committee or not. But that is an aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Murray has proposed to us is that the Privileges Committee not commence its inquiries until the committee has presented a report to the Senate, firstly, assessing the potential risk that such an inquiry may present to any legal proceedings arising out of matters in relation to Senator Colston currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police and, secondly, recommending that the inquiry should report, and until the Senate has made a determination in relation to the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the original motion of Senator Bolkus and Senator Margetts, if it is referred to the Senate Privileges Committee, the Privileges Committee could deal with it straightaway. It is not an overworked committee by any means. There have been only three references to the committee over the last 12 months and they were fairly simple types of references, so it is not a very hard worked committee, although the chairman of the committee is entitled to $8,293 per annum for being chairman of that committee, plus superannuation on top of that.

For the few hours that he puts in he does get 8,293 bucks, plus superannuation on top of it. But there again I hear that Senator Ray is going to stand down for this particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to Senator Murray's proposal. It would be an attractive proposition, if it were not a fact that we are in a highly charged political environment&mdash;a matter raised by Senator MacGibbon. This is what worries me about this whole issue. The parliament should not set itself up as the prosecutor, judge and jury on the issue of Senator Colston. I do not believe that would be regarded very well by the public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2825">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter has been referred to the Australian Federal Police for thorough investigation and action. It is my view, and has been for some considerable time, that the question of illegality which has been raised is of such importance that it ought to be dealt with, and dealt with by the application of judicial principles. To refer this matter to the committee, to see whether dealing with it by the Privileges Committee would involve a potential risk that the AFP inquiries may be jeopardised, is not going to get you anywhere, because, I assume, the government is not going to change its views on the advice that it has been given. It is only going to mean further time wasted by this chamber on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any other circumstances, I would feel that the matter ought to proceed immediately to the Privileges Committee. On this occasion, justice demands that the procedures take their course. That is how I view this matter. That is how the matter would be dealt with if the person who had allegedly committed offences were simply a member of the public. I agree that the matter has got to be dealt with by the Privileges Committee at some stage, but the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has indicated that the Privileges Committee not commence its inquiries into this matter until a statement is provided, in accordance with paragraph 2, indicating that the AFP investigations of payments made to Senator Colston and any legal proceedings consequent on those investigations have been concluded.

The vitriol that has been engendered as a result of this situation has to be heard to be believed. Indeed, it is very hard to believe that there should be such vitriol and hatred. That hatred is eating into the soul of this chamber and of everyone in it. The best way to deal with that is to put the matter into the independent hands of the Federal Police, for them to act with all due diligence to ensure that the matter is properly resolved. I defy anyone to deny that you can actually feel the hatred that is around this place at present. This matter ought to be out of the political arena, and determined in accordance with the legal principles of justice.</PARA>

But sending it to the Privileges Committee is not going to advance the cause of this chamber one iota at this time, while the matter is being dealt with by the AFP.

Again an opposition senator who claims to care about the way in which this place is regarded by the people of Australia and claims to want to lift the standards will not uphold the standards, as he should be doing, in the standing orders. I refer particularly to standing order 193(3) which states that imputations of improper motives and personal reflections on members of this house or any house are out of order. I would ask you to rule that Senator Faulkner should withdraw those remarks that make an improper imputation of improper motives and that he should keep his remarks within the standing orders if he truly respects the institution of the Senate and the rules that all senators have agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a standing order that is very important, but this morning there have been a number of matters put in a similar fashion about groups around the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These arrangements are going to be progressed and investigated by the opposition. We will not be backing away from that at all. Senator Harradine has said that there is a lot of hatred around the chamber at the moment.

I think you need to ask yourself why that is the case, Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because you have come.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be because I have come as Senator Patterson suggests. I have been here since 1989. I think the point that Senator Harradine is making is that he thinks that it is far more intense than it has been since my arrival in 1989. I suggest to you that the reason for that is the consequences of Senator Colston's defection from the Labor Party, his promotion and elevation to the position of Deputy President of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2827"> Senate by the government and the arrangements that were come to as a result of that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of the elevation of Senator Colston to the deputy presidency of the Senate have been enormous in terms of public policy in this country. Perhaps the best example is the partial privatisation of Telstra which would not have occurred unless these arrangements were come to and unless such a deal was done. Senator Harradine may well reflect on those consequences in relation to so many pieces of legislation that have been dealt with by this Senate and what might have occurred if the Howard government had not promoted Senator Colston to this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will progress the issue of the deal. We will progress the issue of the arrangements. We will progress the issue of the role of Mr Howard's liege men in the Senate&mdash;Senator Hill and Senator Alston. We will explore their role. Finally, we will probably establish why Senator Alston was found wandering the corridors of the parliament going apparently to Senator Colston's office. We will probably find out when he went. We will probably eventually find out why he went. We will probably eventually find out whom he talked with. We might even find out what he said. It will probably take some time, Senator Harradine, but we will be working on it. I give you that commitment. We do want to know what role senior government members had in relation to Senator Colston's defence and in relation to Mrs Smith's part in preparing Senator Colston's defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator MacGibbon raised a couple of substantive points in his contribution. He raised the issue of matters that occurred between 1982 and 1984 and suggested a possible course of action. As to the Labor ministers that Senator Ferguson and Senator Hill mentioned were involved at that time&mdash;that is, Mr Beazley and Mr Gareth Evans; of course there was at least another minister involved in that, Mick Young, who has since died&mdash;both of those gentlemen have been approached by the Prime Minister and have agreed that those matters be subject to investigation by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that the matters relating to Senator Hill and Senator Alston and their arrangements with Senator Colston should also be dealt with by the Australian Federal Police. We have not had the benefit or the courtesy of a response from Mr Howard. We asked for a confidential briefing on the matters the government was referring to the Australian Federal Police. We have not had the benefit of that response. You might also consider that, Senator Harradine, as you consider the way you vote on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The politics, as has been raised by other speakers in the debate, are that we know that the Howard government resisted calls for the Colston travelling claim issue to be referred to the Australian Federal Police until the eleventh hour&mdash;until it just got too hot, until the public and media pressure, the clamour from the community, the electorate, became so great. It took an awfully long time for Mr Howard to reluctantly come on board with the view of the Labor Party that the police should be called in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We called for a full-scale police investigation in February. It was not until 8 April, when Mrs Smith actually put out her extraordinary second statement, that Mr Howard came on board. I suspect that that was not the reason at all, Madam President, because you know we have the weakest Prime Minister in this country since Sir William McMahon. He is possibly even weaker than Sir William McMahon because at least he stood up to the then Country Party. It will be very interesting to see how Mr Howard's relationship with the National Party develops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I am quite sure that Mr Howard changed his mind on an AFP referral is that 85 per cent of the Australian public supported a referral to the Australian Federal Police. You might also ask yourself, Madam President: why wouldn't Mr Howard come on board with the opposition's calls for the resignation of Senator Colston from the deputy presidency of the Senate? Again we called for that in January, February and March of this year. We called for it in April of this year. It only again was at the last gasp when Mr Howard came on board.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2828">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard tolerated Senator Colston as Deputy President of the Senate far longer than the Australian community was willing to tolerate him. Mr Howard still tolerates Senator Colston's presence in this chamber. The Labor Party again wants him out. Even Mr Howard, weak and wimpy as he is, could join the opposition and demand of Senator Colston that he resign as a senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are at it, perhaps in other forums we might care to progress the issue of Mr Howard's involvement in the upgrade of Senator Colston's staffer before the vote on Telstra. We might continue to progress those issues. As Senator Hill and others in this chamber start to think about the sliding of the government's standing in the published public opinion polls, perhaps it is because of the approach of our parliamentary institution to parliamentary standards that the hypocrisy of Mr Howard&mdash;who did come to office with a solemn promise to do something about lifting the standards in the parliament and who did say he would do something about lifting standards of not only parliamentary behaviour but also individual parliamentarians&mdash;has been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps this has been responsible for what has occurred in relation to the very significant diminution in his own public standing. I suspect that until he has the courage and the capacity to stand up and be counted on some of these issues, to actually show some leadership in the best interests of the parliament&mdash;but, more importantly, in the best interests of the Australian community and the confidence that community has in our parliamentary institutions&mdash;it won't change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is an opportunity for Mr Howard to do that right now. Here is an opportunity before us in the Senate for Mr Howard to start to rebuild confidence in the parliament, to rebuild the damage to this institution, to rebuild the standing of the Senate and of senators in the eyes of the community, which is at an all&hyphen;time low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard rode into office on a white charger, saying, `I'll do something about the parliament. I'll fix the standards in the parliament; you can rely on me.' He has presided over the standing and the standards of this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament being at the lowest level we have seen since federation. That is the achievement of this weak and wimpy Liberal Prime Minister. Today, he has got another opportunity. Today, with this Privileges Committee reference&mdash;even with the caveat that I accept is a majority view in the chamber, that is embraced by the amendment proposed by Senator Murray&mdash;we do not have to cop the Liberal Party cover&hyphen;up on this Privileges Committee inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Liberals say is this: `We don't just want a Privileges Committee inquiry after the police inquiry, after the Australian Federal Police have investigated Senator Colston's travelling claims rorts and reported on them. Oh no; we want to see a Senate Privileges Committee inquiry after a court case, if there is any. We want to see a Senate Privileges Committee inquiry only after a court case, if there is any, and a sentence, if there is any, or after an appeal, if there is any.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Howard is really saying is that they only want to see the Senate Privileges Committee deal with this matter after the next election. That is what they are really on about. They want to cover this up. They are probably ashamed of their role. They are probably ashamed of the behaviour of Senator Hill and Senator Alston, as Mr Howard's agents in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is very interesting that Senator Alston has not come into the chamber to participate in this debate. I well recall Senator Alston's contribution to the debate, which I am sure he will be reminded of from time to time&mdash;not by members of the opposition but probably by journalists and others in the media&mdash;when you, Madam President, brought down your report containing statements from Senator Colston and Mrs Smith. I expect that even Senator Alston, thick&hyphen;skinned as he is, is probably ashamed of what he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is proper, given the consequences of the direction of public policy in this country, given what has occurred in the Senate in relation to legislation, given the impact that has had on the lives of ordinary Australians, that the Labor Party takes this matter seriously. We will do so, and we intend, in other
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2829"> fora, to continue to explore Senator Hill's and Senator Alston's roles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that we are not proposing to do that through the Privileges Committee. We have proposed tight terms of reference. We have proposed mechanisms such as the support and advice of an officer from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to assist us in this. We will consider any reasonable request to ensure that the Senate Privileges Committee does not in any way trespass in the areas that would be subject to police investigation. We do not want to do that. I think the motion in this form absolutely rules it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you genuinely believe there is a problem, surely you would have adopted at least one of the possible solutions that I put forward, such as briefings, such as meetings to have agreed terms of reference, such as agreeing to have advice to the Privileges Committee from an officer of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. I have more confidence in the members of the Senate Privileges Committee&mdash;on which the government has a majority, I might say&mdash;than, clearly, the government does. I think it is sensible enough to be able to work these matters through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is in no way going to be any part of a cover&hyphen;up. You stand exposed again for not doing anything at all to stop a proper inquiry into matters that can only be dealt with by the Senate Privileges Committee. It is only the Senate that can deal with the matter of whether the Senate has been misled. It is only the Senate that will deal with the issue of whether there has been a contempt of the Senate. It is for that reason that this motion should be passed by the Senate, the government's amendment should be rejected and we start to do something serious about rebuilding community confidence in the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Will we get a copy of the amendment by the end of the lunch break perhaps at 2 o'clock? We do need to have a look at this very closely indeed. I appreciate, Senator Kemp, that the government needs to. So perhaps Senator Allison could give us some indication whether it is going to be available by lunchtime or is it

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This goes to another very important aspect of the legislation that we are considering today, namely, the issue of vesting. There are many superannuation schemes in this country that have an arrangement known as vesting. When a benefit vests, it increases in size quite dramatically. However, once a benefit has vested until retirement age, it is actually quite difficult to access the money. If individuals do not take their superannuation benefit prior to it vesting, the benefit may in fact be substantially less than it would otherwise have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been raised with Labor that many members of the Commonwealth Public Service employee schemes, for example, may find themselves in this situation, particularly in situations of early retirement or redundancy. Certainly, Senator Harradine and Senator Lundy have raised aspects of this issue earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just say as an important side issue on this matter that we touched in part on the problems that face armed services personnel with respect to retention bonuses, but they also face some problems in regard to the two military personnel funds&mdash;the pre&hyphen;1991 and the post&hyphen;1991 funds. I think 1991 was the date of the new military personnel fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> They face a peculiar set of problems with members who were in the old fund, because of the foreshadowed massive redundancies that are to occur in the armed services. And that is an issue that Labor is very concerned about. We have had numerous representations about this issue. It is not an issue that we can deal with in this package of legislation before us today, but is a matter that, in the context of widespread redundancies that are to occur in the military and of the very special nature of their two funds, we will be seeking to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2833"> address as soon as possible at some future date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say in the same context that military personnel alerted us to the particular problem of retention bonuses being included as part of income. That issue has unfortunately not been excluded from a definition of income, but that was an issue that we lost yesterday due to the failure of the government to accept our amendment in that area. But it is a broader issue that affects and is worrying a great many members of superannuation funds and, in particular, Commonwealth public sector employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge unfairly applies to these people, due to the notional surcharge contributions factor. Their surcharge debt will have been calculated on the basis of that amount of money remaining in the fund. Thus, if they take the money prior to it vesting, the surcharge debt will apply to money that they have never received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this basis, Labor has introduced the concept of the member's benefit being reduced in accordance with their actual employment history. This is a measure that we believe the government should have moved itself. As has been the case continually with this bill, the government is either relying on the opposition to address these fundamental concerns being raised by many members in the community or, in fact, getting so pilloried and criticised about this package of bills it finally has had to do something about the particular errors that are highlighted, and this further exemplifies the general problems that have surrounded the preparation of this legislation over the last seven or eight months since the budget announcement last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very little thought was given to the detailed, complex requirements to introduce and implement the government's new surcharge tax. Unfortunately, not a lot of notice has been taken of many of the very positive suggestions that have come from a range of very knowledgeable people who do understand the dramatic consequences of this legislation as it applies to particular groups of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the continual assertion&mdash;we believe an incorrect assertion&mdash;and claim that this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation is fair, the general approach of the government is that this measure really does have little to do with equity considerations. We believe the government has been driven overwhelmingly by the need to raise revenue and institute a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three amendments we are considering simply ensure that the government is consistent with the position that it announced in the budget on 20 August 1996&mdash;namely, to increase equity in superannuation. These amendments are important. They should be approved by the Senate. I am disappointed that the Australian Democrats have foreshadowed they are not supporting these three amendments relating to vesting issues. I do not want to unfairly quote Senator Allison, but she has foreshadowed that general approach in all areas except for three critical areas, and this is not one of them, unfortunately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does see it is incumbent on the Senate where there is a problem that is highlighted by superannuation fund members and their representatives to at least try to address some of the significant consequences that we are advised will occur that will be to the detriment of significant groups of employees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal of thought has been given to the implementation of the surcharge. I suspect there have been very few bills which have gone through this chamber in which more effort has been made to consult with interested groups&mdash;and I have been involved in some of those&mdash;to ensure that the particular concerns of interest groups are taken on board. This does not mean, of course, that the particular groups welcome the surcharge. I am not asserting that at all. I am asserting that, once the concept of the 15 per cent surcharge on high income earners was accepted, again, it is difficult to get a precise handle on the Labor position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2834">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding of Mr Beazley's comments was that the Labor Party supported the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge; certainly former Minister for Finance Senator Walsh said it was a great pity that the Labor Party had not introduced such a measure itself. So it is not surprising that groups who see themselves affected by the surcharge would not be happy. I do not think anyone ever expects anyone who has a surcharge imposed on some particular aspect of their income or superannuation would be happy, but we are about fairness and this surcharge is about fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once having adopted that position, we then set out and worked with groups involved in the industry to let them list their concerns so that we could work through those lists. So your statement about a lack of consultation is just plain dead wrong. It is not accurate. I believe that the government, through the officers of the department, has been particularly assiduous in addressing issues which have been brought to the government's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that Senator Sherry has moved, again, reflect the problem of the Labor Party's approach. Amendments to tax acts and superannuation acts are inevitably very complex and require a great deal of working through to make sure they are consistent, they fulfil the intention of the amendment and they do not cause problems in relation to the overall workings of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, once again, the amendments that Labor has moved&mdash;and which were done without any consultation with us, I might say&mdash;are very vague and complex. They bring in new concepts, concepts which have not been tested before. People would not know how they will work. They bring in the concept of the employer funded component and the notional employer benefit. The notional employer benefit is not an actuarial concept.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This gets back to the incredible complexity of the operation of some of this set of bills. We are dealing with Labor amendments 22, 23 and 50. I say again that this package of superannuation bills is an atrocious way to deal with what is essentially a simple issue, that is, calling on the rich to make a fairer contribution to tax. Doing it by stomping through superannuation with jackboots is not a good way of doing things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present superannuation system, with its diversity of funds and arrangements with employers, has been framed under an immensely complex system of legislation and regulations. Superannuation issues always seem to take a long time because there is such a wealth of detail to address. It is appropriate that things are taken slowly since the diversity of schemes means there is no simple way of doing things, and almost anything the government wishes to do will have unintended consequences in other areas. This is why there is a permanent Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and why it issues frequent reports. This is why superannuation legislation
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2835"> is usually done with drafts and extensive industry consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills were not done in quite this way. I will not blame it on the Australian Taxation Office. I think most of those people would have preferred solutions requiring a few lines in tax legislation. I think this is the direct result of cabinet and ministerial advisers&mdash;not departmental advisers&mdash;coming up with a bright idea of how to tax, without calling it a tax, on some dark night, after too many cups of coffee, too many sweet buns and not enough sleep. One of my staff was unkind enough to suggest other influences, but I would not suggest that. This was probably dreamed up by people who normally do not deal with superannuation. It was given the quick rubber stamp in the House and has been pushed into the Senate. It went to the superannuation committee, which reacted with horror, as anyone reading the report can pick out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations of the committee were ignored, and the legislation was foisted on the Senate with demands that it be handled urgently. I wonder why we have not seen Senator Watson in the chamber defending the government's position on this matter.</PARA>

The person on the government backbench who has probably done the most work on, and has the most in&hyphen;depth knowledge of, superannuation issues is not here defending the government's position. Why?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate was very compliant, perhaps too compliant. Senators did not want to be seen to be obstructive. So debate was truncated and amendments were limited to a few areas. However, the government, in its wisdom, chose to wait to debate this bill until the last hours of Wednesday before Easter, after being given several extra weeks and altered sitting hours to give it some more time for debating legislation. Because the government chose to wait until the last moment, the bill did not get dealt with, and it is a long and involved bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most complex and obviously unconsidered aspects of this bill is the treatment of unfunded defined benefit schemes&mdash;typical of government as an employer. It is awful to see the weight of the government's slipshod approach to this legislation falling most heavily on the public servants, whom they have done their best to make enemies. Perhaps the government attitude towards public servants has something to do with the area where this bill has inadequacies. I cannot say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is clear is that, in spite of various attempts by the opposition parties to rectify inadequacies pointed out in the committee report, the area of unfunded defined benefits is complex and difficult. It is very difficult to work out exactly what, in terms of the way this government has established its tax on superannuation, is taxable under this legislation and how it will be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our understanding of this amendment is that unfunded defined benefits include an employer contribution and then various benefits that can be assessed only at the end of service, and they include factors like length of service and final salary. The question is that, since all this comes ultimately from the employer, but some of it is clearly from investment and increase of funds or its equivalent in these schemes, how is that to be taxed and at what rate, what bits are taxed when, and where are they paid? These are the issues, and there are no clear answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fitting into the government's hasty legislation is trying to force a square peg into a much smaller round hole. It may be possible but not without creating a lot of distress. And guess what! The government is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole right now with an amendment. It is very difficult to get the wording, so it actually works, I imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the intent of the Labor amendment is simply to try to separate the benefits that accrue ultimately at the end of service from what can legitimately be considered a benefit given by the employer, which will be assessed as income for the purpose of this new income based tax. As I understand it, the amendment will try to establish that, where there is a differential of over five per cent between
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2836"> notional benefit and employer funded benefit, some cognisance of this will be taken in this new tax regime and the employee will not be taxed for notional income that was essentially never supplied by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this sounds fair enough and I move to support it. I will admit that I am not an expert in all of the implications of this. Perhaps the government would be kind enough to bring Senator Watson into the chamber to explain it on behalf of the government. That would be very useful. Also, I have not had the time to consult extensively with experts, so I am still listening to the argument. But on balance I believe will be able to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise on the issue of these amendments. I want to go back to a number of issues that have not been put forward in this forum so far. I recall numerous comments by Senator Kemp with respect to the government saying that this is an equity measure and that somehow it will increase fairness amongst Australians in their earning capacity, it being a tax on the rich. I would like to raise the issue of the very people whom this government claims to represent. Government members</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">quite often use the word `battler'. They use it in the context of trying to redefine their own constituency in desperate attempts to pick up support from various groups in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group in particular that is targeted and that has long been associated with the word `battler' is the blue collar or physical grades type industries. The construction industry, the mining area and so forth all come under this category. Whilst this government claims that this is a tax on the rich, I would like to raise the issue of certain groups within those sectors who may, by virtue of the definition that is now provided for `adjustable taxable income', find themselves at certain periods falling in the category that ropes them in to this definition and therefore subjects them to the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do so in anticipation of Senator Kemp getting up and throwing back at the opposition what he attempted to do yesterday, in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying, `You can see the Labor Party does not support an equity measure.' But I put it to you, Senator Kemp&mdash;and I notice the smile on your face&mdash;that we have here a tax that will inequitably target groups of our community. Although some of the people whom I have mentioned may find themselves falling into the category of having earned over the $70,000 mark in one particular year, that does not make them necessarily rich. It may be a factor in the structure of their employment. I ask the government to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of these industries. Let us look at the mining industry. Some miners will be affected by this measure because at certain points in their career their salary packages may show that they have earned over $70,000 per annum. But it is also a fact, conveniently disregarded, that working in this type of employment not only is risky in an occupational health and safety context but also quite often results in early retirement through no other reason than the physical degradation of workers' bodies by virtue of the physical work they have performed all their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same can be said for many workers in the building and construction industry. Show me a bricklayer who is still laying bricks at 50&mdash;not that I know too many bricklayers who earn over $70,000. But by saying in a simplistic form, `This is a tax on the rich' and by broadening out your definition of adjustable taxable income, these are the battlers whom you will rope in. There are probably not a lot of them out there but I felt compelled to at least speak on their behalf because they do not live in big houses and they do not consider themselves wealthy. I am sure they are not comfortable with finding themselves, by virtue of the nature of their industry, launched in your definition of a wealthy person and therefore subject to what you call an `equity measure', which we all know is a flawed tax approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that is worth raising with respect to these people is the nature of their work. The particular circumstances in the last decade have seen moves to create more efficient, more productive industry. Many of the blue collar awards have been through
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2837"> fundamental change led initially by the Industrial Relations Commission towards productivity and efficiency to secure wage increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence it is not unrealistic that the incremental movements that have occurred in the wages of a lot of blue collar workers in this country have not come about just by magic, and certainly have not come about by the generosity of the employer; they have come about by marked and proven increases in productivity. To my experience much of that means longer hours of work, harder work and changes in work structure that may to a large degree involve factors like shift work. And shift work, as you know&mdash;although you probably do not agree&mdash;usually attracts some sort of penalty rate. If you are required to work from 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m. in the morning you would agree that that is a fair and reasonable thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair and reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of people for a period of their lives due to productivity increases might earn more money, but that is certainly not sustainable in their working life cycle. So why should these people be penalised in this way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is transient work. I look particularly to the building industry in this regard. A couple of years ago surveys were done about the actual duration of employment of tradespeople and non-tradespeople in the building industry. The survey at that time showed that a labourer in the building industry, on average, could only expect to be employed for 50 per cent of the time. A tradesperson could expect to be employed for 75 per cent of the time. In each case, the workers in those industries, on average, had to expect to be unemployed between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of their time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the arguments that was used to support the introduction of a severance or redundancy pay system in the building and construction industry. It is a legitimate argument, again, in the context of how you determine what becomes an adjustable taxable income and therefore falls under the auspices of this particular piece of legislation and the application of this new tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that that industry is a cyclical industry. It has booms and busts and they are pretty devastating when they occur. So, when building workers get work, they do every scrap of overtime that comes their way and they take on every job that comes their way, quite often for a couple of years at a time, knowing very well that they face maybe a year or two of unemployment until the next cyclical boom comes around in the property market, in the construction industry and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for that period of time, because of the cyclical nature of the industry, those building workers' incomes might get up around that area. Are they rich? What is equitable about their paying the surcharge at that point because their income happens to be up around that level at that point in their lives? What about the fact that they only earn superannuation and can only grow superannuation in their accounts when they are actually employed? So it is a double penalty. The only time they are actually getting employer contributions is when they are employed. During the period of unemployment, not only do they have no income but also their capacity to improve their superannuation is vastly diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the nature of transient work with respect to battlers&mdash;as the government likes to call them; I would rather call them what they are, which is building workers, physical grades workers, miners and so forth&mdash;is that they are all subject to these trends in their industry and they have no control of that. They expect, unfortunately, to have periods of unemployment during their working cycle. For the most part, it is a reasonable generalisation to make to say that on occupational health and safety grounds they will not have the standard life cycle of work that, for example, workers in the white collar industry do. All these issues impact heavily on their superannuation earning capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, if it were not for the support that those workers in the industry gave to the establishment of their industry superannuation fund in the first instance, some of the groundbreaking progress that has been made for workers in transient industries
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2838"> would not have been made, and we would not be at this point today where building workers and other workers can stand up with pride and look towards their industry fund for a viable retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation undermines their ability to secure a viable retirement income. I ask the government to take into account these factors&mdash;of transient work; of the nature of the work, including shift work; of peaks and troughs in the work life cycle of these workers; and of the fact that they generally may well have a shorter working life&mdash;in its considerations when it seeks to impose this tax upon those battlers.</PARA></SPEECH>

As the debate has ebbed and flowed I have had my doubts from time to time, but I think the concept that the Labor Party has attempted to put out to the public arena is that it believes in the 15 per cent superannuation tax surcharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are debates over the implementation, but there is still not one hint in any remarks that Senator Lundy has made that she even accepts the principle of the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge. There is a debate over implementation and there are complexities, but there has never been one solitary hint. Even Senator Sherry, who has ducked and weaved on this issue, has attempted to portray an impression that he supports the principle. But Senator Lundy, I must say&mdash;not uniquely&mdash;reflects a strong element in the Labor Party that is essentially opposed to the 15 per cent surcharge and would like to have it dropped entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you are quite right: the Howard government is the representative of the battlers and that is the difference between our party and your party. You are the representatives of the union leaders and we are the representatives of the battlers. That is why
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they vote for us and do not vote for you. One of the symbolic reasons you have found it so hard to grapple with this issue is that you are actually opposed to the surcharge on high income earners. Battlers are not opposed to the surcharge on high income earners, because battlers will not be paying the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that way your remarks express the dilemma of the Keating Labor Party, in my view&mdash;that it is a party far removed from its traditional base. Even on equity matters such as this, I do not believe that any other Labor Party pre&hyphen;Keating would have had any difficulties with this issue. But you are a part of a new party, a different party, and a party that finds it difficult to come to grips with some of these important equity issues. I will make a couple of comments on the substance of what you said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think you were really concerned about is whether the threshold was at the right level and whether there should be averaging. Senator Sherry, on your behalf, has essentially signed onto the $70,000 threshold. Senator Sherry has not, quite rightly, proposed amendments relating to averaging because Senator Sherry knows the complexities that such amendments would involve. The substance of your argument was that the threshold should be higher and that there should be averaging, but the Labor Party has not proposed any amendments in those areas, quite rightly. So it is passing strange that you would get up and run that line of debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are cognisant that we have to look at a variety of issues in this bill. For example, we have made adjustments to taxable income. This has been done, for example, by removing for surcharge income threshold purposes things like bona fide redundancies.</PARA>

Senator Lundy felt that some people could be caught up in the surcharge who she felt should not be caught up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to comments made by Senator Margetts, she implied on a number of occasions that this bill has been done without any proper consultation. An implementation advisory group was established with industry associations, including bodies like LISA, ASPA and the Australian Society of CPAs. A great deal of work has been done. That is not to suggest that those groups want a 15 per cent surcharge&mdash;in fairness to them, they probably do not&mdash;but people were prepared to sit down and work through these issues and the government was very keen to ensure that the matters they raised were effectively addressed. So it is wrong to create the impression that somehow the government's intention, announced on budget night, was hidden from the public and that there was not enough time for proper consultation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supports the concept of a 15 per cent tax on people earning more the $70,000 a year. Let us put aside the fact that you, Senator Kemp, Mr Howard and Mr Costello gave a pledge not to introduce a new tax at the last election. You gave an absolute pledge: no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. You asserted at the last election that this was an absolute promise. And what do we have? The government's biggest revenue raising measure in the budget is a new tax that is supposed to apply to people earning more than $70,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard felt a bit nervous about calling it a tax. In the cabinet discussions we can all imagine Mr Costello saying, `We need to get some revenue, half a billion dollars, and where can we get it from? We will tax super, but we had better not call it a tax because we did give a promise at the last election that we would not introduce a new tax.' So Mr Howard is still going around the country calling it a surcharge. He is about the only one who has not called it a tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even Mr Costello has called it a tax.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has called it a tax. The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, has called it a tax on occasion. It is called a tax in the budget papers. What you have to realise, Senator Kemp, is that there is extreme anger&mdash;including from many people in the Liberal Party and some of your own colleagues&mdash;not only about you breaking your promise but about the Prime Minister continually calling this provision a surcharge. It adds to the insult. People are upset enough about you introducing a new tax, but trying to call it a surcharge&mdash;and the Prime Minister continues to call it a surcharge&mdash;was one of the issues that led to your predecessor's demise. He was struggling with trying to justify calling a tax a surcharge. But enough has been said on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other fundamental concern of Labor&mdash;and we have enunciated this in this debate&mdash;is that the 360,000&hyphen;odd people who earn more than $70,000 a year were not the only people who were going to be affected by the tax. That is not Labor's assertion: the evidence provided to the select committee was that a significant number of lower and middle income earners were going to have to pay the tax. That is one of the two principles on which Labor has said very clearly, `We are going to make a stand.' We are not going to tolerate one lower or middle income earner&mdash;let alone one million&mdash;being hit by this new tax at the full 15 per cent rate. That is a fundamental principle for Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To touch briefly on the averaging issue, Senator Lundy quite rightly pointed out some of the difficulties for people who earn a low or middle income one year and a high income the next. Building workers and mining workers are in that category on occasion during their employment. There are others. We have had representations from AFL footballers. In the first 10 years of their football career, they earn substantially above $70,000, but it is pretty tough for a lot of them after their football career is ended. We have had representations from people in the theatrical and the film industries. But Labor came to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conclusion that it is not our job to attempt to provide some protection for those people. We thought about it and we tried to look at an averaging concept but, like the collection mechanism, we would have to sit down and design hundreds of amendments. It is not that we do not have any sympathy for those groups in society; we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of consultation, Senator Kemp continues to assert that there has been extensive consultation. But the important point is not just that there has been extensive consultation; the consultation occurred after the government announced the measure&mdash;not before&mdash;and the point is there has been very little listening and acting on the advice given. I have challenged Senator Kemp time and time again. He has referred to LISA, ASFA and the CPA, who are on the implementation advisory group. The point is: were they happy about the government's response to this consultation? The fact is they were not. They were not happy about the government's response and reaction or about the amendments to the set of legislation we have before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have challenged Senator Kemp to name one individual and one group that say they are happy with the outcome of the consultation process. Senator Kemp still cannot name any. Searching to find a member of industry, he did give us the name of our leader yesterday&mdash;Mr Beazley. I did not know that Mr Beazley was from the superannuation industry, but Senator Kemp was searching to find someone who would support it&mdash;and he still cannot find someone who will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is the point. There has been no satisfactory outcome and no listening. Why? Because we have a Prime Minister who insists on calling a tax a surcharge and who, in addition to that, fundamentally does not understand or has not sought to understand the concerns of the industry&mdash;and this includes everyone in the industry, from lawyers to accountants to the funds to the life insurance industry. Senator Kemp, even your great mates, the banks, have said in the conversations I have had with them on RSAs&mdash;and we will get to that later in the day&mdash;that they are astounded by this set of legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been up to Labor to alert the so&hyphen;called battlers&mdash;those earning less than $70,000&mdash;to the fact that at least a million of them are going to be whacked by this new tax. That is the evidence we have. That is what the funds who have the members and do not have the tax file numbers advise us. We are going on evidence, not on blarney, bluff, arrogance and refusal to listen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not attribute ignorance to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, nor a lack of understanding of at least some of the difficulties associated with this new tax on superannuation. In Mr Costello's case, it is sheer blind arrogance: `Don't back down, never retreat until you have to. Go through the facade of listening, but never back down.' That is the sheer arrogance of the Treasurer. It oozes out of him on this issue. Members of the Liberal Party opposite who are very upset about this package of legislation know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In your case, Senator Kemp, I will attribute it partly to the fact that you have only had the job for three or four months. This measure contributed in part to the demise of your predecessor, Senator Short. It does take some time to get up to speed and I sympathise with you, Senator Kemp, being dropped in the middle of this shambles&mdash;halfway through the consultation process&mdash;and having to justify the government's position. You have to answer to Mr Costello, who has been calling the shots on this. He is your boss. He says, `No compromise&mdash;do not act on legitimate industry complaints,' and you do what he says.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Gibson, for that important question. Senator
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Gibson was right in saying that the former Labor government was noted for high spending, high taxes, big borrowing and a big debt. Senator Gibson, you would know and some of the public would know that between 1989 and 1990 and to the year 1995-96 outlays went up from $89 billion to a whopping $132 billion, with spending growing at nearly five per cent above inflation on average each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you will know that in the last five years of the Keating government the Labor Party racked up debts. Total deficits were in the order of $70 billion, which, according to my maths, works out at about $4,000 for each man, woman and child&mdash;or persons, if you like, Senator Sherry&mdash;as a result of the massive spending program of the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Keating government put up taxes in a whole range of areas. Wholesale sales tax rose and not a word of protest; the Keating government substantially increased petrol excises and not a word of protest from the failed ministers on the front bench. They increased the Medicare levy, the wholesale sales tax on cars, the fringe benefits tax, departure tax and a raft of taxes. That was the role of the Keating government&mdash;tax, tax and tax. After all that, despite those very substantially increased taxes, what in fact happened was that Labor left office $10 billion short of balancing the books&mdash;a major black hole which Labor refused to acknowledge in the election period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In stark contrast, we have provided substantial tax relief and in our first budget made major progress towards eliminating the budget deficit. Our tax reforms, in contrast to Labor's tax increases, have provided relief in the following areas: the well&hyphen;known family tax initiative that will benefit some two million Australian families; a tax rebate for eligible people who have taken out private health insurance; reduction of the provisional tax uplift factor; CGT rollover relief for small business; reforms to the fringe benefit tax areas; and a tax rebate for eligible lower income aged persons.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two years of unnecessary delay and extraordinary high cost. What a waste of time. What an extraordinary waste of totally unproductive moneys. It meant that 3,200 direct and indirect jobs available during the construction stage of the zinc mine have been denied&mdash;an area where there are few jobs. Another 4,000-odd direct and indirect jobs in the production phase have been delayed two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the Aboriginal communities of the gulf will receive the same $60 million package offered by the company in August 1995, when it was thought that native title over the mine had been extinguished. For two years, local and regional economies, small businesses and hundreds of Aborigines in the area who were looking for jobs have been denied the training and financial benefits from this mine all because the system failed. Australia lost badly needed export income essential to address Labor's mammoth foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now proven unworkability of the Native Title Act puts question marks over the vital investment we must attract domestically and from overseas to get the bank of major proposed resource projects&mdash;$55 billion worth&mdash;under way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Senator Troeth. I do not know why the Labor Party continues to mislead students on these matters. I am pleased to confirm that the full fee paying places next year will be in addition to additional government funded places, that they will be limited to 25 per cent and that that limit is set in concrete in legislation passed in this chamber. It is not transitional up to the year 2000 at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted yesterday that Senator Carr interjected saying, `Oh, but you've used transitional.' They are trying to create the impression out there in student land that there is some doubt about whether the 25 per cent limit stays. I need to explain to him, because he

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make this point: without the rules that phase in 25 per cent of the student load being full fee paying a large and prosperous university could next year sell 25 per cent of its first year places to fee payers as well as 25 per cent of the total of its second and third year places to new third year students. If you do not understand what that means&mdash;I say that because Senator Carr looks like he does not&mdash;I will explain. It means that a big prestigious university could siphon off final year students from other smaller universities and they could do that next year. Having done the first year at another university, those students could complete their degree at one of our most prestigious universities for the cost of one year's up&hyphen;front fee.</PARA>

The whole point of the guidelines is to protect the smaller universities that Senator Carr claims to champion. The 25 per cent limit is set in stone, in legislation. Senator Carr was here when that legislation was passed. But he often has the capacity to put his mind in neutral and his mouth in overdrive as we full well know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that a leftie like Senator Carr would be crowing with glee at the prospect of the so&hyphen;called rich paying more money to universities. Is he really seriously saying that he would prefer to see a wealthier student in a government funded place than see that place freed up for a student who would otherwise have missed out on the chance to go to university? The fellow blusters away like Foghorn Leghorn but his message is really that of Chicken Little. Just as the sky did not fall on Chicken Little, neither will academic standards nor the number of government funded places at that our universities drop as a result of this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne university has already passed a motion indicating the entry requirements will not drop.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence efficiency review secretariat elected to engage a consultant rather than use internal staff arrangements as it was important to have a communications strategy in place prior to the release of the review. The scale of the task was considered to be beyond available resources. Defence public information staff were largely committed to existing tasks including exercise Tandem Thrust and the Blackhawk inquiry. The review has enormous implications for defence personnel. A strategy for communicating these implications within Defence as well as externally was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The firm Turnbull Fox Queensland was selected by restricted tender from three companies with a track record in Defence in communications strategies and change management. They were selected on the basis of capacity and key personnel, past experience and price. Their task was to prepare an issues management and communications strategy which would include a presentation to be used by commanders and managers to brief their staff; prepare fact sheets, articles and letters to assist defence personnel comprehend the scope of change; anticipate a range of questions that could be posed by stakeholders both within and external to Defence, together with appropriate responses; and ensure stakeholders were appropriately informed of the recommendations of the efficiency review.</PARA>

I understand that the researchers have emphasised that their results cannot be extrapolated to humans. Indeed, I think about the most one can say at this stage is that if there are mice in the community who are genetically predisposed to developing lymphoma they would be well advised not to use mobile phones.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not in the business of trying to tell everyone that there are unacceptable risks attached to using mobile phones, or of trying to frighten everyone out of using mobile phones. What we are very concerned to do is to ensure that Australia keeps up with world's best practice in this area. That is why we commissioned that additional research. You would have heard my comments on the Standards Committee some time ago. From memory, it has something like two out of 17 or two out of 24 representatives of the carriers on it, so it is a very widely based industry standards committee. The Standards Committee met earlier this year and agreed to retain the present scientific basis and the derived exposure guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is always the capacity for them to review those standards. We expect that all responsible scientists in this area will be constantly monitoring the results of research around the world. To simply jump on one survey, when the researchers themselves emphasise that the results cannot be extrapolated to humans, is yet another example of trying to turn this into an issue that might frighten some people unnecessarily. You would be much better advised to play a constructive role in ensuring that the research does cover all of the projects that have been undertaken around the world. I know that Senator Allison has a very extensive library on this subject. It is one of her grand obsessions. She cannot, therefore, have any difficulty in ensuring that the Standards Committee is fully apprised of all those surveys which she regards as important.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2856"> Mr Eoin Cameron, the member for Stirling, to describe Senator-designate Lightfoot. The only explanation that the government can offer is that there is some constitutional problem about selecting Mr Lightfoot's successor in the Legislative Council of Western Australia. That is a red herring. That has nothing to do with this chamber. It has nothing to do with this question. It only has to do with the Liberal Party's sleazy manoeuvring to maintain their numbers in the Legislative Council in Western Australia. It should be rejected by this place as misleading, as diverting and not in fact answering the question at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been 96 days since this vacancy has occurred. The Senate has sat for 25 days and will probably sit for a further 29 days before this vacancy is filled. That, on both occasions is a record&mdash;96 days is a record, it has never happened before in the history of the Australian constitution, and 25 days is also a record. Western Australians have been unrepresented for that length of time. We have, of course, extended a pair and done the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real reason for this delay is the most shameful thing of all. The real reason is that Mr Lightfoot, who was preselected on 5 April and remained in Western Australia until after 21 April, stood to gain $466,000 in a superannuation payment. Reason one for the delay is a massive kick to his superannuation entitlement&mdash;don't mind the constitutional conventions at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the other reason is even more serious. Mr Lightfoot himself said in the Legislative Council just the other week that the reason he was remaining was that he wanted to vote for the divisive and iniquitous Western Australian industrial relations legislation. He is, in fact, flouting the constitutional conventions to vote for a piece of legislation that divides my state of Western Australia sharply and which is condemned on all sides except the small cabal of right wing extremists led by the industrial relations minister, Graham Kierath, in the Western Australian parliament. That is the reason why he is delaying and not filling the vacancy that has occurred here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is contemptuous of Western Australian electors; that is contemptuous of the constitu
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tional conventions; that is contemptuous of this Senate; and it is contemptuous of the fair and democratic procedures that Western Australians expect their state government to uphold and this Senate to reflect. The state government in Western Australia is ramming through this industrial relations legislation using the gag and the guillotine in the Legislative Council because it does not have a mandate. It does not have the numbers if the properly elected Legislative Council takes its seat on 22 April&mdash;and never in the 100-year history of the Legislative Council has that been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators Campbell and Knowles, who spoke out about the delay in this, have been silent. They spoke out on 5 March when they attacked the Western Australian government for a 41-day delay. There has now been a 96&hyphen;day delay. The failed numbers man over here, Senator Campbell, who said, `A vote for Lightfoot is a vote against me,' when he was canvassing for Michael Huston in the preselection process in Western Australia, has remained silent about this travesty of constitutional convention when he was outspoken several years ago&mdash;a hypocritical action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the same with Senator Knowles. They have not stood up for their state of Western Australia at all. They argued that this was a travesty several years ago. Now they remain silent and are hypocrites as a consequence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President West, this is the first time I have been able to stand up and officially congratulate you on obtaining your position. What is this all about? Why do we have this here before us today? It is purely and simply because we have seen in Western Australia, since the Court government came into power, very successful, for the state and the work force, changes to labour market arrangements in Western Australia. I will not use the word `fruit loop' to describe Senator Cook, but I think it may well have been, had
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2857"> it not been withdrawn, a fairly appropriate term to describe his contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the facts as to why they are jumping up and down and complaining about the fact that the Hon. Mr Lightfoot MLC, before obtaining his position here, finished his tour of duty in the Western Australian parliament. First of all, we need to deal with the workplace agreements. This is what this is about&mdash;nothing else. All the rest is a charade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the workplace agreements in Western Australia and what has occurred there. What is happening here is an absolute charade. The only reason this is happening is that further reform has gone through the Western Australian parliament and your mates have told you to kick up a stink about it. There is no other reason whatsoever for what you are doing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1993 you said that wages would be cut by 25 per cent. Remember? What has happened? In 1995, Western Australian workers received the largest increase in average weekly wages of any state in this country. You said that workers would have to sign or resign. What a falsehood&mdash;absolutely untrue. You said that state awards would be abolished. Not one single state award has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else did you say back then? And Senator Chris Evans, through you Madam Deputy President, was one of the people who gave adjournment speeches here night after night. We listened to the sorts of things he was saying. He said that penalty rates and leave loading, et cetera, would be abolished. None of these conditions has been abolished. You know, Senator Evans, they have not been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before we won government you know that some of these conditions were traded off into enterprise agreements. That is no different. Exactly the same thing has occurred, and you know that. We will test you if you get on your feet to refute that. You also said that minimum conditions would become maximum conditions. The fact is that workers cannot be paid less than the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act prescribe. But we find in the survey work that has been done that there is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> less than one&hyphen;quarter of one per cent whose wages have stayed static or decreased in a minor fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 99&frac34; per cent have all increased&mdash;and increased significantly, as the figures show&mdash;and that is borne out by what I said earlier in terms of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on, in the time that I have left, to look at some of the allegations that have been made. You do not want these lies to be exposed&mdash;and this has been spelt out very clearly. We are told, `The minister refused to negotiate.' In fact, it was not the minister who refused to negotiate; it was the TLC which refused to negotiate even before it had seen the bill. We are also told, `There is no community support for the legislation.' First of all, this has been around since 1993; there is nothing new about it. Who won the election? That is a good question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above and beyond that, a recent independent survey showed 55 per cent of the people polled supported secret ballots before industry action. Other surveys have been, as Senator Bishop over there knows, as high as 90 per cent. That is the reason why you brought this issue up in here today&mdash;you did not want this to be exposed.</PARA>

We are told, `Secret ballots before stop&hyphen;work meetings are compulsory.' Why don't they tell us that employers may decide to approve a stop&hyphen;work meeting because it could prevent a balloted strike? We are then told, `Union dues can't be deducted from pay.' Union dues deductions can no longer be forced on employers by the WAIRC. If there is an agreement between employer and employees, union dues can be deducted just like HBF payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2858">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concluding comments, in terms of what has been thrown up here today, are that the noises that have been made by those opposite are more to do with the instructions from their masters to keep up a smokescreen because of the success of the workplace agreements legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to take note of Senator Hill's answer to my question to him today regarding the filling of the Senate vacancy caused by the death of Senator John Panizza. Firstly, in response to Senator Crane I say that, despite what I thought was a fairly confused contribution, he did make one crucial point: that this is all about the Western Australian industrial relations legislation. I thank him for doing that because he totally undermined his leader's position and proved our case. What we are saying today is that this is all about the Western Australian industrial relations legislation, and your confirmation of that, Senator Crane, at least was an honest contribution. It was far more honest than that of Senator Hill, who tried to pretend that there existed some constitutional difficulties and that was why there had been a delay in the appointment. But you, Senator Crane, at least were honest. You said this was about the exercise of political expediency and I thank you for that. As for the rest of your contribution, I think any further comments are best left unsaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, as Senator Cook pointed out, that the Liberal senators opposite have been very quiet on this issue considering the outrage they expressed when the vacancy of Senator Vallentine was debated in this place. Senator Campbell and Senator Knowles made very telling contributions at that time as to the need for Western Australia to be represented fully in this chamber and to have a replacement senator appointed as quickly as possible. They made a compelling case, so much so that the Senate carried a motion supporting that outcome. Now we have a situation where, in my view, the federal Liberal Party is abusing the decency of the opposition by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continuing to exercise a pair in the Senate when it is, for political motives, failing to fill the vacancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We offered a pair to the Liberal Party on the death of John Panizza, as we would normally do, on the basis that they would obviously move to fill the vacancy with a senator&hyphen;elect from their party. What we have seen since is an abuse of that arrangement, an abuse of the convention, and an abuse of the goodwill and the decency of the Australian Labor Party by your using that offer by the ALP to delay the replacement, allowing yourselves to exercise your full voting entitlements in the Senate without any price being paid in terms of loss of a vote, while at the same time you are refusing to appoint the replacement senator because of the Western Australian government agenda. I think the federal Liberal Party and the senators here are complicit in what is going on in Western Australia. They ought to be ashamed of themselves because that really is abusing the arrangements that have been made in terms of the pairing of a now deceased senator.</PARA>

He has said in the Legislative Council of Western Australia that he is not coming because he will stay, under Premier Court's instructions, to exercise the vote because you are not sure that the present Legislative Council would vote with you on the bill without him. You are not sure in your claim that the state Labor opposition would continue to extend the pair despite making that offer to you if Senator&hyphen;designate Lightfoot took up his position in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

They know that on 22 May the composition of the Legislative Council changes and that, for the first time in the history of the Western Australian parliament, conservative legislation will be reviewed by the Legislative Council in a proper way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will not be a Labor majority. There will be a Legislative Council which has Democrats, Greens, Independents and Australian Labor Party members. They will expose this legislation to scrutiny, and the Liberal Party and Premier Court know that it cannot survive that scrutiny. It is malicious. It cannot survive any sort of independent or proper scrutiny, because it is politically motivated and it is designed to attack the interests of working people in this state and to attack the WA trade union movement. It does not stand up to any tests in terms of our international labour obligations or international law, and it does not stand up to the standards of common decency and fairness that have been applied by Western Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody who has looked at the bill in Western Australia, bar those who are members of the Liberal Party, has rejected the bill. You have no wider support for the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to take note of Senator Hill's answer to a question that was put to him on the timing of the arrival of Senator&hyphen;elect Ross Lightfoot in terms of the constitution of Western Australia. It is the point which Senator Hill made, and that is that there is a constitutional problem in bringing Mr Lightfoot here before the date that has been accepted as the date on which he will come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might explain that the Western Australian constitution  provides that if there is a vacancy in the upper house, instead of a by&hyphen;election for an upper house seat, the next person on the ticket for that upper house province is brought in to the Legislative Council. The end of the term from the election at which Mr Lightfoot was elected to the Legislative Council is 22 May, and the relevant election is not the 1996 election, it is the 1992 elec
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion. It just so happens that there is nobody left on the Liberal Party ticket to replace Mr Lightfoot if he is admitted to the Senate before that date. Thus a legal question arises as to how he could be replaced in the Legislative Council before the beginning of the new term for the Legislative Council which, as I said, is 22 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just a fact. There is no question of shonky politics or funny deals. The fact is that there is a legal issue, a constitutional issue, involved and that Mr Lightfoot, out of a sense of responsibility to the people of Western Australia, is ensuring that the Western Australian Legislative Council continues to operate as it should with a full complement of Liberal Party members until the constitution provides a mechanism by which he can be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That mechanism will be that after 22 May he can be replaced by the next person on the Liberal ticket for the North Metropolitan province, which is the ticket on which he was elected, and that person, I believe, will be Mr Ray Halligan. That is the point of Mr Lightfoot's delay in coming to Canberra&mdash;that is, respect for the Western Australian constitution and a sense of responsibility to the people of Western Australia which I, for one, think is very commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak about Mr Lightfoot and the kind of senator he will make. He will bring to this Senate a great wealth of life experience. Mr Lightfoot is a very successful man. He has had a very broad experience in Western Australia. He has been in the army. He has been a successful pastoralist and miner. He has a great knowledge of the eastern goldfields and the pastoral areas of Western Australia and, as well, he has other business interests. Furthermore, he has been a state MP for many years and he will bring to the Senate a wealth of experience in terms of representing Western Australia in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of comments that have been made about the industrial relations legislation are of interest but, nevertheless, the fact remains that the principal reason why Mr Lightfoot's arrival in Canberra has been delayed is a matter of the Western Australian constitution and the need for him to wait until
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2860"> the new term of the Legislative Council begins before he can be replaced in the Western Australian Legislative Council. As I said, I see that as an act of great responsibility on the part of Mr Lightfoot and the Liberal Party to the people of Western Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking note of Senator Hill's answer, I want to make a few comments concerning the failure of the Western Australian Liberal government to appoint a successor to the late Senator Panizza. It is now some 96 days, as outlined by Senator Cook, and will be well over 110 days before Senator&hyphen;designate Lightfoot takes his place in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That delay has occurred despite the Liberal Party endorsing Mr Lightfoot on two occasions. It has occurred despite the Western Australian parliament sitting for some weeks, and that delay continues despite many opportunities to fill the vacancy. That delay, as we all know, is occasioned because of crass political opportunism by the Western Australian government. That political opportunism arises from defiance of the will of the electorate of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last December, the electorate voted and chose to alter the composition of the upper house in the Western Australian parliament. For the first time since its creation last century, the electorate has refused to give a mandate or control to the government in the lower house. The electorate chose a raft of Independents and minor party representatives to advance its interests. The government did not fall; however, its control in the upper house was removed. The electorate deliberately determined to apply a brake, a caution to the feared excesses of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the reaction of the Western Australian government to that decision? Has it heeded the message? Has it become more balanced in its approach? Has it had due regard for the will of the people? The answer is no, no and no again. It has put forward a piece of legislation that is biased, unbalanced, divisive in approach, partisan in outcome and contemptible in its abuse of process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has refused to allow full and open debate on the bill. For the first time in 100 years, it will use the guillotine on Thursday to prohibit
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussion on the bill. What is so important about this bill, this third wave of industrial legislation, that requires the guillotine? A lot of the content of the bill&mdash;secret ballots, right of entry, penalties and limitation of federal award coverage&mdash;is already covered by the federal act. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party and the labour council in Western Australia have indicated a willingness to negotiate around these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters, however, are not the crux of the bill, because the government changes its position and issues draft amendments almost on a daily basis. The heart of the bill is the intent of the government to isolate one sector of the not for profit community in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to regulate the political activities and political expenditures of trade unions, which, after all, are not for profit institutions. So if you are a charity, registered or otherwise, a church, university, non&hyphen;profit hospital, a voluntary association like the scouts, Red Cross or St John's Ambulance, you are free to engage in political activity, political lobbying or political expenditure. Those organisations and institutions are expected to seek to play a role in the political processes to advance the interests of their constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if you are a member of a voluntary, not for profit registered organisation known as a trade union, you are not permitted&mdash;indeed, it would be illegal&mdash;to engage in political lobbying or expenditure of a political nature. So if you are a shop assistant, your union may not lobby on issues that are critical, such as extended trading hours, despite the government appointing your union to the relevant trading hours committee. If you are a construction worker, you may not lobby about portable long service leave or workers' compensation, despite the government creating a special tribunal comprising your union to address those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a member of a registered employer organisation in industries like mining, petroleum, milk vending, hairdressing or abattoirs, you cannot engage in political activity or political lobbying. By contradistinction, if you are a member of an unregis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2861"> tered, non-profit employer organisation like the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, you are free to raise funds, supply your building to the Liberal Party for election purposes and provide the services of paid employees to engage in political activity of the kind outlawed in the bill for trade unions or other registered employer organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have been the results of this political thuggery by the Court government? Most importantly, there has been a further loss of faith in the institution of parliament. There has been further disenchantment of the arrogant attitude of the Court government as it defies the political will of the electorate of Western Australia. All of this is because of partisan, divisive, non-productive and sectional hatred of the trade union movement by the Court government. All of this is about petty power and mean politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little flummoxed at the fact that we are even having this debate from the point of view&mdash;Senator Cook is obviously not awake enough to realise&mdash;that Senator Evans has actually put down an urgency motion on this very subject today. I am blowed if I know why we are having the debate twice. However, as I intend to speak on the debate later, I will cover a different subject area to that which I will cover later. I will focus on some of the things that people from the opposition side have said in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans made the point that the opposition in Western Australia had guaranteed a pair for the Hon. Mr Lightfoot to leave the Legislative Council and come here. Senator Evans is obviously living in fairyland as well because he does not know that the Labor Party did last night what they always do when industrial relations is debated in the Western Australian parliament. They called off pairs. That is exactly the reason why Mr Lightfoot is not in the Senate now. We knew
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exactly what the Labor Party would do in the event that he left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give another example. We have had the industrial relations package before the parliament in Western Australia. Senator Bishop just talked about the result in Western Australia last year. I will come to that in a later debate. Senator Bishop just happened to overlook the fact that the coalition government in Western Australia was elected with an increased majority, not a decreased majority. But he very conveniently forgot to mention that when he spoke about the will of the people. Is it not fascinating that he decides to forget about the result and just interpret the result in a way which is convenient for the purpose of this debate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about is protecting a government agenda which is clearly to be sabotaged by a Labor Party that had its worst result in Western Australian history. That is not a bad effort. Here they are sabotaging it. I will come to the question of the other part of the result in a later debate. I think it is important that we focus on some of the `will of the people', as it is now being termed by the opposition in this place and in the Western Australian parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole purpose of the legislation over there is to give effect to secret ballots. The people of Western Australia happen to want secret union ballots. They are sick of the thuggery that is going on. In Western Australia today we have the tanker drivers going out. So they are now going to hold the state to ransom. This is all at the directive of the trade union movement and the Labor Party in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that we want to get the legislation through the Western Australian parliament? Is it any wonder that the Labor Party was not trusted with the pairing arrangement? There was another informal pairing arrangement that was evidently made with the former leader of the Legislative Council. It happened to be the former leader of the Legislative Council who called pairs off on previous industrial relations debates. Is it any wonder that they are not trusted with their word? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2862">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately Senator Evans gives every indication to this chamber that he is a trustworthy person with his word in the Whip's position. No-one but no-one can question that. He has given his commitment and he has honoured that commitment but what a pity he does not have people of his ilk in the Western Australian parliament who can honour their commitment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2863"> eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Airports (Building Control) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No 292. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the following matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 2.03 provides that in certain circumstances the airport&hyphen;lessee company must grant consent, grant consent subject to conditions or refuse consent, in relation to building approvals. This is a discretion with important commercial
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2865"> consequences which appears to be exercisable by a non&hyphen;government company with the decision reviewable by the AAT. Also, under r.4.01 the Secretary may appoint as airport building controller not only an authority of the Commonwealth, but also a State or local government body and, in specified circumstances, a corporation, a body or an individual. Regulations 5.02 provides that certain decisions of the airport building controller are subject to AAT review. Thus the Regulations appear to envisage that decisions of Commonwealth, State and local government authorities and bodies, corporations, bodies and individuals could all become subject to review by the Commonwealth AAT. The Committee asks whether there are any legal or administrative problems with this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the rights to review by the AAT provided for by r. 5.02 are quite extensive, there appear to be a number of possible gaps. Regulation 2.13(2) provides the building controller with the discretion to allow building to be carried out without complying with the Australian building standards. Regulation 2.16 provides for amendment of a building approval by the building controller. Neither discretion is included in r. 5.02. Also, r.5.02 includes review of decisions made under rr.3.04 and 3.10 but not under the related rr.3.12 and 3.14. The Committee considers that all of these discretions should be subject to AAT review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 2.11 deals with decisions by the airport building controller on applications for approval of building activity. Subregulation 2.11(6) places an effective limit on the time within which a decision must be made. The Committee suggests that it may be appropriate to apply similar provisions to other decisions made by the building controller under rr.2.16, 3.04 and 3.10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of `building approval' in r.1.04(1) refers to an approval under r. 2.14 when the appropriate reference may be to r.2.11. This appears to be confirmed by references in r.3.06 and Items 1, 2 and 3 of Part 1 of the table to r.5.02.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that time limits should be imposed on the making of certain decisions under the Regulations, because of the possible commercial impacts that failure to make timely decisions will have on applicants. I will seek advice on reasonable time limits to impose in regulations 2.16, 3.04 and 3.10, and have them amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You note an error in the cross&hyphen;reference in the definition of "building approval" in regulation 1.04(1). I will have this definition amended to cross&hyphen;reference to regulation 2.16 at the same time as the above mentioned amendments are made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I propose to have these amendments made now that the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, which makes some amendments to the Airports Act 1996, has completed its passage in the recent Parliamentary sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked whether there are any legal or administrative problems with review by the Commonwealth AAT of decisions by public and private bodies and individuals. I am advised that this is a valid arrangement in terms of both legal policy and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations put in place a system for the approval and certification of building and demolition works on Commonwealth&hyphen;owned and privately&hyphen;operated airports. This is the direction that approvals processes of this kind are taking in most fields and the States are adopting systems which allow relevantly qualified bodies and individuals to approve and certify buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As "airport building controllers", the powers that relevantly qualified local government bodies and individuals would utilise are powers under Commonwealth legislation, namely the Airports Act 1996 and the Regulations. It is legally possible for the Commonwealth AAT to review decisions made by persons other than the Commonwealth if those persons are lawfully authorised to exercise powers under Commonwealth legislation (for example, see subsection 25(3A) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contracts put in place with airport building controllers will require them to operate under the same legal principles and administrative procedures as are applied to the Commonwealth and its agencies, including merits review.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 20 February 1997 seeking my advice regarding certain aspects of the recently tabled Bankruptcy Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked whether a person removed from a registration committee has a formal right to respond to allegations that have led to the removal. While there is no special mechanism provided for in the Regulations, the general provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (AD(JR)Act) would apply to decisions of this nature. These provisions confer a right on a person affected by a decision to be given the reasons for the decision and to seek a review of that decision in Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that the provisions of the AD(JR) Act are adequate to guarantee a formal mechanism for persons affected, by a decision to remove them from a committee, to air their concerns. However, as a matter of good administrative practice, any person who is removed from a committee will not only be provided with reasons for their removal but will be given an adequate opportunity to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note for the Committee that a decision to remove a person from a committee would not normally be made public as the committees are convened ad hoc to deal with specific applications for registration and do not continue on foot after this duty is performed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 20 February 1997 and your subsequent notice of motion given in the Senate on 5 March 1997 regarding the Family Law Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1996 No. 265.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for my advice in relation to a number of aspects of the process of accreditation of a laboratory by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) to carry out parentage testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new regulations are intended to ensure that scientific and technical standards for parentage testing for use in the Family Court are such that parentage tests can be relied upon to have a high degree of accuracy. It is therefore directed to ensuring that recognition is based on appropriate scientific and technical standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATA was established by the Commonwealth Government in 1947, and now operates as a non&hyphen;profit company incorporated in Victoria. NATA is recognised as Australia's national body for the accreditation of laboratories. An association of members, who are the nominated representatives of accredited laboratories, NATA is governed by a Council made up of nominees of Commonwealth and State governments, industry groups and the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> professions, as well as elected representatives of accredited laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the Family Law Act 1975 nor the regulations themselves provide NATA with the authority to accredit laboratories. Rather, the regulations simply provide that a test carried out at a laboratory accredited by NATA in accordance with the standards that enable the laboratory to be so accredited are taken to be carried out in accordance with the regulations. The regulations therefore recognise the role of NATA in setting appropriate scientific standards and criteria for the carrying out of particular tests. The regulations do not purport to prevent parentage testing procedures being carried out by a laboratory which is not accredited by NATA. There could, however, be evidentiary difficulties and it would be necessary to prove, in such a case, that the test had been carried out in accordance with appropriate scientific criteria and standards, and that the procedures were such that the results could be relied upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked about the nature of the arrangements, the criteria and the standards for accreditation of a laboratory as a parentage testing laboratory. NATA accredits laboratories across a wide range of scientific fields, including biological testing, chemical testing, electrical testing, mechanical testing, medical testing, optics and radiometry, and wool testing. I am advised that in order to be accredited, all laboratories must meet the criteria set out in the "General Requirements for Registration" booklet. A copy of this booklet is attached for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, requirements related to the specific field of testing are set out in supplementary documents for each field of testing. I attach a copy of the "Supplementary Requirements for Registration&mdash;Parentage Testing". I am advised that the criteria for accreditation for parentage testing were developed by a steering committee comprising six scientists from medical and forensic fields who held ministerial appointments to undertake parentage tests and prepare reports under the then regulations, a representative from NATA, and a lawyer from my Department. In addition, I am advised that all parentage testers holding ministerial appointments and working in the field at the time were consulted in the development of the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will see from these 2 documents, the criteria for registration are directed to ensuring that an accredited laboratory can be relied upon to provide test results that are accurate and reliable. In order to ensure this, the general requirements for registration cover a range of matters including laboratory staff qualifications, equipment, maintenance of records, testing equipment and sample identification. The Supplementary Requirements for Registration&mdash;Parentage Testing provides specific requirements relating to technical aspects of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2868"> conduct of parentage testing, staff qualifications and training, test method validation, quality control, security and specimen management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for my advice as to what rights of review exist for laboratories which are refused accreditation. I am advised that an applicant for registration is assessed by a team, comprising a NATA staff officer, and at least 2 specialist assessors, selected from the relevant field of expertise. Assessors may not be drawn from laboratories in competition with the applicant, and an applicant has a right of refusal in relation to assessors. I am advised that this method of assessment allows for assessment by peers who are technically competent, and who do not have a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the assessment covers all aspects of the laboratory's operation, and addresses each of the criteria set out in the 2 registration criteria documents. I am advised that NATA does not refuse registration on the basis of an unsatisfactory assessment. Rather in such circumstances the applicant is provided with a written report at the completion of the assessment, detailing which, if any, criteria are not met satisfactorily, and any remedial action required to enable registration to be granted. Should a laboratory disagree with the assessment, I am advised that if the area of disagreement cannot be resolved by discussion, a review by another assessor would be available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised, therefore, that a refusal of registration would be relatively rare. Rather, an applicant for registration is provided with information as to what action, if any, is necessary in order that it meet the criteria, and further assessment carried out once that remedial action has been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this information meets the Committee's concerns. I would be happy to provide any additional advice should the Committee desire it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are important matters and the Committee suggests that it may be appropriate for the Regulations to provide for applicants to be given notice of any adverse material received by the Minister under these two heads and to respond to it before a decision is made. The Committee accepts that the enabling Act includes wide review provisions but considers that the personal rights of applicants would be enhanced by such an amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, rr.34 and 41 provide, among other things, for the Minister to revoke or vary a special permit if the Minister becomes aware that the applicant gave false or misleading information or did not disclose information that ought reasonably to have been disclosed.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1997 No 13, which provide for the environmental management of airports. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the following matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regulation 1.08 provides that tests for the Regulations must be carried out by a laboratory accredited by NATA. The Committee would appreciate your detailed advice on the process of accreditation. As the accreditation of a laboratory appears to be a commercially valuable privilege, what rights of review exist for laboratories which are refused accreditation? Regulation 1.08 also provides that testing must be carried out in accordance with a method approved by NATA or, where
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2870"> no such method is approved, in accordance with methods approved for tests of that type by USEPA, the American Public Health Association or the American Society for Testing Methods. In contrast to those possibly changing approved methods, r.6.11(3)(b) and Schedule 4, 2.05(2)(a) and 4.01(2)(b)(i) and (iii), correctly provide for the incorporation of material as it exists at a particular date. The Committee asks why this was not done for the apparent incorporations in r.1.08.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although some decisions made under the Regulations are subject to full AAT review a number of provisions set out in regulation 9.01 appear to provide only for review of discretions by the Secretary and not by the AAT. These discretions vary in importance, but some are significant. The Committee suggests that it may be suitable to provide for AAT review, even if a preliminary review by the Secretary is appropriate. In addition, some direct or implied discretions do not appear to be subject to any review, such as decisions under rr.2.01&hyphen;.04, 6.09&hyphen;.11 and 10.01. These include commercially valuable discretions. Here again, the Committee considers that it may be appropriate to provide for review by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Subregulations 6.05(2)&hyphen;(4) provide in effect that an airport&hyphen;lessee company has a right of entry to an occupier's premises and access to any document, under the control of the occupier, with penalties for non&hyphen;compliance. These appear to be very wide powers, which even the police do not have without a warrant. Also, the provisions do not appear to include the usual safeguards under which the people entering must produce photographic identity passes. In addition, the people entering do not appear to be employees of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency and therefore may not be subject to the safeguards provided under, for instance, legislation relating to privacy or the Ombudsman. The same considerations apply to entry under r.6.19. The Committee would appreciate your detailed advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Part 8, Division 2 provides for infringement notices. Some such system may be appropriate, but the provisions appear effectively to confer power on a non&hyphen;Commonwealth body to impose fines. In addition, regulation 8.03 does not appear to include the usual and necessary safeguard that infringement notices should advise that, if the fine is paid, then payment not only discharges the liability and prevents any prosecution for the matter, but also that the person concerned is not to be regarded as having been convicted of an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Paragraphs 10.04(1)(a) and (b) provide that notices to people by, presumably, the Secretary or the airport environment officer, may be given by pre&hyphen;paid post. However, subregulation 10.04(2), which provides for giving notices or applications by people to the Secretary or an airport environ
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment officer, does not include this concession, which may be unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are possible reference errors. Paragraph 6.06(1)(b) refers to a report in regulation 6.01, although subregulation 6.01 does not refer to a report. Paragraph 9.01(1)(d) also refers to a report under r.6.01(2). Schedule 2, 1.01 refers to the definition of `waters' in regulation 4.02, although it appears that this should be r.2.02(3). Schedule 2.1.02(1) refers to subregulation 4.02(1) but there does not appear to be any such provision.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Airport Regulations, Statutory Rules 1997 No 8, which implement a regulatory regime for Commonwealth&hyphen;owned and privately&hyphen;leased airports. The Committee would appreciate your advice on a number of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, r.2.02, which sets out grounds for refusing to transfer an airport lease, includes a number of subjective and vague expressions. Two provisions of r.2.02 are not only subjective but also confer a discretion upon the Minister. The Committee accepts that the enabling Act provides for AAT review of a decision not to approve a transfer and that this is an important safeguard, but would welcome your advice on why the provisions are so broad and subjective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, r.2.03(2)(b) provides that, if an airport lease is terminated, the Minister may direct that the Commonwealth or a person nominated by the Minister be substituted for the former lessee. Although this appears reasonable, r.2.03(2)(c)(ii) then provides that the person nominated is not liable under the agreement for liabilities arising before the Commonwealth or person is taken to have become a party to it. The Committee would appreciate your assurance that this provision will not prejudice the creditors of a terminated airport&hyphen;lessee company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, r.2.04(1) prohibits specified subleases and r.2.04(2) prohibits certain licences. In both cases, however, the provisions confer a discretion on the Secretary to permit a sublease (or licence) to a State or Territory government or an authority of a State or Territory government. These are commercially valuable discretions with no indication whether there is independent review of their merits.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2871">  </PARA>

I agree with most of your suggestions and propose amendments to implement them. My comments are as follows (I have adopted your numbering for ease of reference).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The requirement at regulation 1.08 that testing for the purposes of the regulations be carried out by a laboratory accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA) was based upon expert advice of the need to ensure tests can be relied upon as evidence. The regulations do not provide NATA with the authority to accredit laboratories. Rather, they provide that a test carried out at a laboratory accredited by NATA, in accordance with the appropriate scientific protocols and standards that enable the laboratory to be so accredited, are taken to be carried out in accordance with regulations. Non&hyphen;compliance with this regulation does not result in a sanction, it merely means the test is invalid for the purposes of the Regulations,.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATA was established by the Commonwealth Government in 1947, and now operates as a non&hyphen;profit company incorporated in Victoria. The organisation is recognised as Australia's national body for the accreditation of laboratories. An association of members, who are the nominated representatives of the accredited laboratories, NATA is governed by a Council comprised of nominees of Commonwealth and State governments, industry groups and the professions, as well as elected representatives of accredited laboratories.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATA is party to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Commonwealth (through the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism) in which the "Commonwealth recognises NATA as the national authority for accreditation of laboratories performing tests, measurements, calibration and related services to standards of good laboratory practice" (Clause 1.1). The Commonwealth has agreed that, "where it requires testing to demonstrate compliance with laws, technical specifications, regulations purchasing and similar instruments shall normally specify use of laboratories accredited by NATA" (Clause 3.4).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While NATA accreditation may be of commercial value, it is the only suitable accrediting agency in Australia and the criteria for registration of laboratories are directed to ensuring that an accredited laboratory can be relied upon to provide test results that are accurate and reliable. Should this change it would certainly be appropriate to amend this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have sought my advice on the rights of review that exist for laboratories which are refused accreditation. I am advised that an application for registration is assessed by a team, comprising an NATA staff officer and at least two specialist assessors, selected from the relevant field of expertise. Assessors may not be drawn from laboratories in competition with the applicant, and an applicant has  a right of refusal in relation to assessors. I am advised that this allows for assessment by peers who are technically competent, and who do not have a conflict of interest.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's advice that regulation 1,.08 should provide that testing standards should be those which were in force at the commencement of these regulations is noted, and the regulations will be amended accordingly.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2872">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The process of review by the Secretary under regulation 9.01 of various decisions of the Airport Environment Officer provides those affected by such decisions with a low&hyphen;cost, accessible initial administrative review process. This does not compromise or affect any appeal rights provided for under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. To ensure that this is clear, regulation 9.04(e) specifically identifies decisions made by the Secretary under regulation 9.02(1) as being amongst those which are AAT `reviewable decision(s)' under Division 2 of Part 9 of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee also noted that some `direct or implied' discretions in the Regulations do not appear to be subject to any review, and that this affects some areas involving commercially valuable discretions. The initial selection of decisions which would be subject to AAT reconsideration was reviewed by the Civil Law Division of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. Following your advice I have requested a further review of the identified Regulations to be undertaken and the regulations will be amended to reflect its findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under Division 2 of Part 6 of the Act, it is clear that the airport&hyphen;lessee company is to bear ongoing responsibility for the environmental quality of the airport. To satisfy that responsibility, it must monitor pollution and take steps to prevent, control or reduce the environmental impact of airport operations. These are generally operations conducted by other parties. The airport&hyphen;lessee company needs to have adequate powers to carry out these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of safeguards relating to the airport&hyphen;lessee company's right of access to a sublessee or licensee's site for monitoring purposes under regulation 6.05. These include a requirement for prior notification in writing and a `reasonableness' test. The regulation is merely intended to codify rights that an airport&hyphen;lessee company would have as head lessee of all airport land and is not intended to provide for additional powers. However, your points will be referred to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have suggested a link between regulation 6.05 and regulation 6.19. While the limited powers of access provided under regulation 6.05 would be exercised by a private entity (the airport&hyphen;lessee company), the powers to enter and perform remedial work on sites which are exercisable under regulation 6.19 rest solely with the statutory office&hyphen;holder known as the Airport Environment Officer (AEO). The AEO will be subject to a comprehensive framework of accountability, as set out in these Regulations and the Airports Act. As an appointee of the Secretary, the AEO will be required to comply with legislation relating to privacy and the Ombudsman.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The infringement notice penalty system provides an alternative and inexpensive means for a person accused of a contravention to dispose of the accusation. The ability to issue infringement notices under Part 2 of Division 8 has been limited to the statutory office&hyphen;holder (AEO), within this accountability framework, with the penalty paid to the Commonwealth. While the issues of discharge of legal liabilities and release from prosecution are dealt with in section 138 of the Act, I agree with the Committee's advice that an additional safeguard should be provided in regulation 8.03 covering immunity from criminal conviction (where the fine is paid) and propose to amend the regulations accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The inconsistency which the committee notes regarding the acceptability of giving notice under the regulations through pre&hyphen;paid post will be rectified through an amendment to this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The cross&hyphen;referencing and labelling errors noted by the Committee have been reviewed and changes to regulations 6.06(1)(b) and 9.01(1)(d), as well as clauses 1.01 and 1.02(1) of Schedule 2 will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airports Regulations</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I object. I deliberately missed the last vote by reason of the fact that this system of the government agreeing to a notice of motion going formal and then voting against it is a farce. It is a farce with regard to the Senate procedures and it is a farce because those of us who want to hear the arguments cannot hear the arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the notice of motion by Senator Brown which was put forward as formal, it was agreed to by the government that it go formal. I was not aware that there was going to be a situation for that to take place. Had I been here, I would have refused the motion. I intend from here on in, if I happen to be in the chamber, to refuse every single request because I do not believe it is proper to have a situation where a notice of motion is declared formal unless the text of the notice of motion is agreed to throughout the whole of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this particular occasion I am sorry that it is Senator Margetts, because she is a stickler for the rules and her office does do their homework and provide information; but that is not the point. The point is how am I to make up my mind about those particular matters unless I can hear the arguments. That does not only go for those particular matters but, in my view, for every matter. So I put everybody on notice that that is the way I am going to go about it from here on in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is fair to the subject matter for matters to be determined outside of this chamber as to whether you are going to, under the whip, vote one way or you are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to vote the other way. I think there should be a proper discussion about the matters. There was no proper discussion about the matters with respect to the last matter&mdash;that was Senator Brown's motion&mdash;and there is not going to be able to be a proper debate on the matters on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is entirely up to senators, when leave is denied, to seek suspension of standing orders. I understand why the government has taken this view. It wants to short&hyphen;circuit things; that is fair enough.

Last time we had this problem I approached Senator Harradine and suggested that, on a daily basis, we would approach him and advise him personally as to which motions we were prepared to allow to go formal and then to vote against. I am informed by the Parliamentary Liaison Officer that Senator Harradine was indeed contacted last night but had indicated to her that he was too busy to talk at that time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is not the point, Senator Harradine, but what I want to say is that I agree with you in principle. The government has made a decision that when an issue requires debate&mdash;some of these issues do require debate&mdash;we will often debate it. We made the decision, and you are within your rights to refuse formality. That is always a risk. You know we have an informal arrangement that we will tell you what we are doing. You always let us know what you are doing as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matters raised by Senator Brown about returns to order in relation to anything to do with woodchipping are a weekly occurrence. Senator Brown has it marked in his diary that every week he is going to raise a matter to do
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2881"> with woodchipping. It usually involves a return to order in relation to documents. Quite frankly, to have a two&hyphen;hour debate or a one&hyphen;hour debate&mdash;or any debate, quite frankly&mdash;about whether or not it is in the Senate's interests, Australia's interests or anybody else's interests for the department of the environment or any other department to put together thousands of pages of documents is something that I do not think requires debate, quite frankly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is no different from the last 50 motions Senator Brown has moved; he has actually succeeded in getting this one through. I suspect that the motion in relation to logging in old&hyphen;growth forests is quite similar. I do not make any imputation against Senator Margetts, because she cares deeply about the issue. It is very similar to a whole range of motions that have been moved by Senator Margetts and others in relation to logging in old&hyphen;growth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a decision that we do not need to put the government's position or any of our positions in relation to these issues any more. If Senator Harradine needs to hear debate, then he can exercise his right to refuse formality, which he has done today. We do respect that right. We say to the Senate that we seek to inform the whips how we will go in relation to all the motions where that is possible. For Senator Harradine's benefit I have put in place other arrangements which ensure that he is personally advised.

<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no doubt about the urgency of this motion today. If we wait any longer we will see further destruction of a forest in Western Australia which is an interim listing on the Register of the National Estate. People in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community wonder just why we have those listings if they are ignored. It is urgent that we debate this. It is urgent that the message gets through. This message is coming back again and again to the parliament because it is happening again and again in our forests. It is very urgent that, in the case of the Giblett block, an area adjourning the Beedelup National Park, the level of concern within the community is brought to the attention of governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent for those people who think it is so important that they are currently in the forest, probably in miserable conditions, trying to save that which is dreadfully important to them. It is urgent for the thousands of people in the region whose jobs depend on the forests remaining old&hyphen;growth forests that the forests do not end up as glossy paper in Japan or Korea. It is urgent for them because that resource, that growing forest, cannot be plonked back together again. Their jobs are at risk. We are not just talking about the people at BHP&mdash;though that is a very serious concern. But how is it that, although there are thousands of people employed in the tourism industry in Western Australia, there are no top level summits? It is probably urgent that we do have top level summits about the implications for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent that we should talk about how we can shift to a mechanism which will not continue acting in this unsustainable way. And, of course, it is urgent in relation to the ecosystem which will be destroyed in our lifetime. You cannot grow back an old&hyphen;growth forest&mdash;we have no example of that happening. The best that the Department of Conservation and Land Management can cite is what they call the 100&hyphen;year forest. Guess what? They are aiming to go into that again. Even though the forest is growing back, they are saying, `Give them leave to go back in again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent that we protect our national heritage. It is urgent because the chainsaws are in there now; sites have already been started. It is urgent because people are desperately trying to bring the situation to attention. They are desperately trying to stop the heavy equipment and the chainsaws in the middle of the forest as we speak. It is only fair that we

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter which ought to be debated and dealt with. This is a matter which requires action by the federal government, remembering, as Senator Margetts has said, this grand forest is on the interim Register of the National Estate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is trying to stir them to action&mdash;and I am referring here specifically to Senator Hill, having responsibility as the chief environmental officer in the nation, and Mr Howard, the Prime Minister of this country and therefore in the most politically powerful position to defend the national monuments of this country.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that there is a time in Australia's history when there are decisions being made that need to be responded to. The context of the situation in relation to the logging of old-growth karri and jarrah forests in the Giblett block north&hyphen;west of Pemberton in Western Australia is that the federal government is currently moving to throw away its responsibility to the environment, which includes the monitoring and approval of export licences for woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a situation where the federal government think they can throw away responsibility for the environment, despite the fact that they use various federal powers in lots of different ways for taxing, exporting
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2884"> and so on when it comes to corporations. When it comes to the environment, they do not want to take that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in the middle of a very big debate in relation to superannuation. There is no problem at all with the federal government getting involved with corporations. There is no problem with the federal government getting involved with telling you how to save for your retirement, what you do with your money and what you do in relation to corporations, taxing and so on. There is no problem at all with getting involved with issues right around Australia that affect various parts of Australia, but there seems to be a little part that says, `If it's to do with protecting the environment, we don't want to use these powers and we will pretend they don't exist or throw them back to the states.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, we need to make it very clear that, as we speak, this area of interim listing on the Register of the National Estate is not just being prepared for logging. They have already done groundwork and we are at the stage where people are risking their lives by actually setting themselves up in trees to try to save the forest because they believe it is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know people who live in and around the Giblett block who are very disturbed about losing their precious forest, that area that they love. That is why they live there. The area around the coast in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia around Bunbury and so on is much more recognised these days as an industrial area. It is not really considered a country town anymore. It is another urban area. Bit by bit those areas of refuge, if you like, from city life become more and more precious to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as they become more precious to us in our urban environment, it means that those people who live in urban areas who need to seek the refuge of forests, who need to be able to remind themselves that life is not just about freeways and smokestacks, who need to be able to re-establish that connection with nature, are finding they want to go to those areas. Guess what? When they go there, they have to stay places, they have to eat, they then spend money at local businesses. In fact, far more employment is actually being created
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by people who are enjoying the forests in their natural form&mdash;that is, not in their glossy paper form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far more people in Western Australia are gaining employment in that source of the forest as a resource than they are putting whacking great logs through the woodchipper. It does not actually take a lot of people to put a forest through a woodchipper. You can watch it go through, and I have watched them go through. They are not talking about cut off branches. I have watched entire trees going through the woodchipper and it does not take a lot of people. It is not the same as industries which actually create highly value added goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people in the area around Pemberton&mdash;and there is plenty of information on people living in and around the area of Pemberton&mdash;who use the forest products, who use wood from the forests that has fallen down, who use all sorts of trees, including fruit trees, to make beautiful things that will last lifetimes. That is value adding, yet it is extremely difficult to even get hold of wood like Jarrah in Western Australia for those kinds of crafts, for furniture work and for those kinds of businesses which can employ lots of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to get hold of those woods. It is difficult for those people who want to create employment, and often that is because what is left on the forest floor after a clear fell for woodchipping gets burnt. So, instead of allowing craftspeople to use that for value adding, it gets burnt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not talking about a choice between jobs or no jobs; we are actually talking about what is by far a very poor solution. It is particularly poor because the woodchips that you gain from old&hyphen;growth Karri is not even considered to be prime product by those people buying the goods. If you made a list from Nos 1 to 8, the woodchips gained from the logs of very old Karri would probably be about No. 7 on the list. They are not the preferred product of the industry. Because they are not the preferred product of the industry, they do not actually attract a particularly high price.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2885">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They would prefer to use globular trees, Australian blue gums, which are grown in a number of places throughout the world. They are growing in South America, South Africa and various parts of Asia. These have been growing for some years now and it is well known in the industry that we are reaching  the point where those crops are ready for harvest. The industry knows very well that they are reaching the end of the point where you will be able to push Karri logs off to the market and expect them to be bought. The prices of Karri logs will go down through the floor because they are not the preferred product and because plantations of Australian blue gums are now on stream in many places throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a very hasty exploitation of remnant old&hyphen;growth forests before the market dwindles. I have seen graphs from the Department of Conservation and Land Management which looked at how much was being cut. I asked them whether they understood what was meant by `ecologically sustainable production' and they said, `Yes, this is sustainable yield.' I said, `How come the graph goes along and then dives down?'&mdash;which is funnily enough around about now&mdash;and they said, `This is the yield that's sustainable this year and then we'll run out of those kinds of forests that are easy to get to and then that is the yield that's sustainable then.' I do somehow doubt whether they had a real concept of what sustainable yield was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about looking into the future. Instead of blaming the greenies, instead of blaming the people who value the forest, perhaps they could have looked at themselves to see whether it was particularly wise planning for the industry, for those people who were employed in the industry and for the forests and those people who need the old&hyphen;growth forests for their employment, to be going along in that way so that you can stand and look at a woodchip mill and say, `Look, this particular mill is under threat for these four weeks if we don't have access to this particular coupe of old&hyphen;growth forests.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you call an industry a sustainable industry when you must have access to a forest which is an interim listing on the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Register of the National Estate or the industry or people will be put off? How can that be called in any way sustainable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have plantations of other kinds of trees in Western Australia. We have had, in my opinion, the Department of Conservation and Land Management sitting on their hands in many respects with regard to promoting agroforestry&mdash;that is, the ability to incorporate farm forestry and cash crops for farmers which they can use as their superannuation. There are lots of things that can be done. There are experiments being done to try to grow hardwood trees as cash crops in a fairly fast growing manner. There are lots of things that can be done and there are some things I know the Department of Agriculture is trying to do in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that the Department of Conservation and Land Management are trying to attract funding for so-called salination projects when, in fact, they are just using their same programs over and over again. How can we look at what is happening in Western Australia, how can we see what is happening with old-growth forests and interim listing forests, which are valued not just by the people in that area but by people right around the state, and then say as a parliament that it is okay that the Commonwealth gives up that ability to be an overseer on whether or not states are doing the right thing in exporting woodchips or are doing the right thing with respect to greenhouse? Think of the greenhouse effect of cutting down old-growth forests. How much CO2 will a little seedling use up compared with a huge tree?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the current situation? I think we currently have people who are putting their lives on the line to try to save these forests. We have century old trees and ecosystems which are impossible to replace in anything like our lifetimes. It is impossible to think that it would be possible to replace ecosystems&mdash;the mixture of hollow logs, the mixture of trees that have fallen down, the mixture of the necessary underforest as well as the nesting places for birds and the places for other creatures to live&mdash;in anybody's lifetime, if you ever could.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2886">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes it is the little things within the ecosystem&mdash;the not so cutesy things, the not so warm and fuzzy things&mdash;that are just as important if not more important than those furry creatures which are often used on posters. You never get `Save the blue&hyphen;toed slug' campaigns because it is not going to catch the public appeal. However, sometimes it can be the blue toed slug&mdash;if there is one that exists&mdash;which is in fact the vital link within the ecosystem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funnily enough, some time later you will find situations with dieback where people try to find a nice little reason why things start happening, a nice little reason why the rest of the trees we have in our forests are dying back. Often the reason is a combination of reasons that we have been developing over time&mdash;that we have cleared too much around, that we have used too much clearance for farmland, that we have logged too much, or that we have left a remnant by itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it seems to me that we have to take responsibility for species. We have to take responsibility for the ecosystems. We have to take responsibility for the people who rely on those natural systems for their livelihood and for the people who rely on those systems to be there to know with certainty&mdash;and isn't that an over used word&mdash;that that natural heritage that has been there for hundreds of years will continue to exist and not end up on the garbage heap of another country overseas as glossy paper, maybe not even used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we stand up for what is right here. If it is boring for the government, I just hope that some of this message is getting through. The community no longer believes that it is acceptable. That is why it is necessary for us to put this motion today to the Senate. I urge all senators to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying Madam Acting Deputy President, we have heard  far too little from the government in defence of the fact that it is actually the agent of this destruction. Senator Hill, who is absent from the chamber, has the environmental responsibility for protecting the grand forests of south&hyphen;west Western Australia. This Giblett block is made up of magnificent statuesque eucalypts&mdash;some of the tallest of hardwoods, and amongst the tallest flowering plants on the face of the planet&mdash;but they are being handed across to the chainsaws, mainly to be trucked to the woodchip depots to be sent to the Northern Hemisphere to be converted into paper and ultimately to end up on the rubbish dumps of countries on the other side of the world. That is the stream of action which this minister for the environment, Senator Hill, this Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and this government are designating for natural monuments of this nation of ours. It is an utter disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the best that can be done for these forests? It is left to citizens who feel in their hearts that they have to run the risk that Senator Margetts spoke about. They have to run the gauntlet of legal action and possible imprisonment to peacefully oppose the violence which this government has organised against these natural living forests, their panoply of species and the persistence, despite the odds against them, of rare and endangered species. These include the chudditch,  the native cat, the red&hyphen;tailed black cockatoo, the numbat and a whole range of other species, to which Senator Margetts referred, which do not get such publicity because they are not in the same league as far as attracting immediate human sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is Senator Hill? Why isn't he here? Why has he got such disdain for a key component of the natural heritage of this nation
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that he does not feel that he even should come in here to defend his appalling record and his irresponsibility as far as the environment is concerned? What a disgrace this minister is. What a blight this is on the reputation of this country for environmental excellence. What a thumbing of the nose this is by Senator Hill and Prime Minister Howard to that 70 to 80 per cent of people in this nation who believe it is high time that we took a lead in the world as far as protecting wild forest is concerned, instead of being renegades amongst the developed nations and putting ourselves in league with the worst of deforestation in poorer countries or areas like Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Siberia and the Amazon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly the league that Senator Hill and Prime Minister Howard put themselves in and they are flouting national sentiment on this matter. They are against what the majority of people in this country think about the defence of such grand forests as the Giblett block. It is those citizens down there today&mdash;trying to peacefully ward off the machinery that Senator Hill and Mr Howard have sent in&mdash;who deserve the accolades. Unfortunately, because the feelings of those politicians who have the power in this place are reflected by Premier Court and his government, it is the people who are doing the right thing and standing by the environment who face the penalty, who face the punishment, and who have to put up with the discomfort and the potential long&hyphen;term litigation in defending themselves for doing the right thing by the natural heritage. It is a pretty black spot amongst a pretty grey performance by this new government, which has so rapidly accrued such a rotten record of apathy at best and downright hostility at worst towards this nation's great, wild and scenic forest heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the fastest rate of destruction of our wild forests in this country at a time when we have fewer of them left than ever before in history. That is the record of Senator Hill. That is the record of Prime Minister Howard. Australians did not vote for that. Sadly, they did not get much better previously out of the Labor government. But this government has gone from bad to worst.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2888">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, who is sitting opposite, tried to make some snide remarks about my getting up to bring this issue up in this place according to some diary. I will tell you what the diary is, Madam Acting Deputy President. It is his minister's series of regulations coming through this place to dismantle any checks at all to protect our forests, the wildlife and the public interest against those woodchip companies making a quick buck out of the  destruction from which the forests can never recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why shouldn't I respond? Why shouldn't we, who feel strongly about these forests, get up in this place and take this issue up to the government which is so remiss in allowing this destruction on the altar of a few dollars by Bunnings and other like companies, which have been caught in the act of illegal logging in the past and which would be able to get away with what this government now makes legal in an area that should be sacrosanct? It is an area that should be a national park and that should be celebrated by a government reflecting the feelings and the sentiments of the people of Western Australia and of this country as a whole towards these grand remnant forests of south&hyphen;west Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disgraceful, appalling behaviour, by Senator Hill and it shows a lack of responsibility by Prime Minister Howard. It is the worst behaviour, I submit, considering that there are Western Australian senators in this place who will have seen this Giblett block&mdash;if they have not, they have a responsibility to do so because it has been a matter of contention for years. I take my hat off to the women and men who are doing their job for them against the odds that they have set up in the Giblett block in Western Australia.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rounding area rather than the broader and very important issues already raised by other contributors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware, as Senator Campbell is, that there is debate within his own party as to the wisdom of the route that is being taken in a number of our forests. That debate is not carried out on purely environmental grounds; it is carried out on economic grounds. There are Liberals, and perhaps members of the National Party too, who believe that our old&hyphen;growth forests and our magnificent south&hyphen;west forests are worth more standing up than lying down, on purely economic grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are being chopped down by the organisation I refer to as Genghis CALM because they are both pillagers and conservationists. The trees are being chopped down far too cheaply and without any regard to their alternative use. The alternative use is not just their intrinsic natural beauty&mdash;all the eco&hyphen; and botanical matters that Senator Margetts alludes to. Their alternative use is as a long&hyphen;term feature of human use, of human attachment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Giblett block is in an area of the south&hyphen;west which is experiencing greatly increasing tourism. We know that tourism in that area is a result of the natural environment. Visitors come there specifically because of the attractions of our forests and of our rivers and of the general environment. Chopping down all the trees in that particular area is not a particularly smart economic move, and I deplore it on environmental grounds. But on economic grounds it is one opposed by tourism and small business, who have strongly pleaded with the Western Australian government not to carry on the activities that are going on there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a proposal which has been put before the state government, which has sought to enlarge the national park there, which is some 1,700 hectares, my memory tells me, to about 19,000 hectares and bordering the Donnelly River. That would then take in the Giblett block. That would relieve the stress of nearly 70,000 people currently visiting that small national park and would provide an opportunity for a significant growth in tourism and in facilities in the area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2889">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also advised that the total economic value that will be generated as a once&hyphen;off from that destruction of the Giblett block will be about $3 million. That is not a sum of money which is to be sneezed at, but it is certainly not the value that should be gained from leaving those forests alone and allowing them to be developed and used in a tourism manner and in a long&hyphen;term sustainable national park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the conflicts that have arisen in this issue are those between very strong backers of very strong factions within the coalition government of Western Australia, and the alternative forces of those who wish to preserve and protect the Giblett block on both environmental and economic grounds. It is for that reason that I plead with those members of both this government and the Western Australia government who hold an alternative view to continue to argue for that view, particularly with regard to this particular block.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that members across the chamber feel very strongly and somewhat aggrieved about the entire woodchipping and forestry argument but this particular debate, this particular motion, is about the Giblett block. It is about a small area which we are trying to get preserved. I have the plans if any of you need to see them. In fact, I recall tabling them in the parliament. The proposal has been prepared on very sound grounds. I would like those of you who are strong supporters of the woodchipping and forestry industry to set that issue aside and just look at the preservation of the Giblett block. I urge you to support Senator Margetts's motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by complimenting Senator Margetts. She has argued very forcefully and very fully for this motion in a manner which, I believe, puts the case very clearly. I hope my remarks add to the strength of support for her motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks in regard to Senator Margetts's motion, more on the point of the proposal that the government has been pursuing over the removal of export controls on woodchips and what that will actually lead to. The minister has commented on this on a number of occasions and, in a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most recent report in a local paper in Tasmania, he said that the removal of such export controls would lead to greater employment generation, greater investment et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in part looking at the granting of a licence, which was put up in a previous motion by Senator Brown that related to some private forest at Surrey Hills south of Burnie which was granted a degraded forests licence. The unfortunate thing about that, which I believe also has some connection with what happened in WA and I suppose has, in part, led Senator Margetts to moving her motion, is that the particular forest in Tasmania, by way of example, is rainforest and did contain sawlogs. The company, North Broken Hill, did call tenders for the processing of those sawlogs. There were tenders put in with the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the best of my knowledge and from what I have been able to ascertain, the company never responded to any of those tenderers. Indeed, one of the tenderers rang up to see whether or not their tender had been successful or otherwise. At that time they were asked, `How much timber do you wish to purchase?' From memory, it was 11,000 cubic metres per annum of myrtle and sassafras timber, which are rainforest species, that they wished to purchase. The company, North Broken Hill, replied, `Sorry, we're not interested; that's not enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That tenderer would probably have provided about 35 jobs in the Burnie region. The timber would have been processed into solid timber pieces right down to a finished product and exported to Japan at around $5,000 per cubic metre. Now the timber from that area will be woodchipped and probably sold off to Japan for somewhere in the order of $150 per cubic metre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these sorts of things that have to be and should be of significant concern. I can remember when we debated the disallowance motion on the regulations relating to export woodchip controls. I made some points about how woodchip export companies come along every year with a plethora of proposals for downstream processing in Australia. I made the point at that time in a plea to Senator Harradine, in part, and Senator Colston in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2890"> hope that they would vote against the government's proposed regulations for export woodchips because they simply did not protect employment or provide for employment generating investment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the time that one particular company, namely Boral, had on the table some $160 million worth of projects for Tasmania. I said at that time that I believed that that company would ultimately withdraw all of  those projects. Having said that, I received a fairly vigorous letter from the manager of Boral accusing me of misleading the public and saying that I should actually apologise. They sought for one of their officers to visit me here in Parliament House and to put the record straight and to actually give me the facts and to say that they were committed to these proposals. I wish I had brought the letter into the chamber to read it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to another newspaper report of 20 March 1997. It is headed `Timber giant scraps plans for $160 million mill'. I have not had any more phone calls from Boral. I have not had any explanation from Boral as to why they are not proceeding with those developments that would have created a significant number of jobs for Tasmanians. I would suspect that some companies in Western Australia&mdash;I note that Bunnings could be one&mdash;export woodchips without a licence and this poses a very interesting question. I can recall when we were in government that a person who exported one boatload of woodchips suffered significant financial cost as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the coalition government is bending over backwards to serve these major companies who have no interest whatsoever in downstream processing in this country. The Commonwealth government really has only one power&mdash;that is, the Export Control Act. It can actually force some change on this industry. It is an essential change. I say that in particular in relation to my own state because we do not have too many things going for us down there at the moment. We have seen Coats Patons close and we saw Stanley Tools close. We have the ships bounty that looks like being scrapped by the current government. That would possibly
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead to the closure, at least a significant downgrading, of Incat, which is one of the major employers in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have an industry in the state that has real potential. But it will only have potential if governments, particularly at a Commonwealth level, take decisions that give the right sort of encouragement. If the encouragement is not there, they need to take the stick out and force the change because there are people out there who would like to invest in the timber industry in this country, turn it into a much better industry than it is and provide much greater employment than it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I do not agree with all of the points in Senator Margetts's motion, I do believe that it draws to the attention of the parliament some very important points. I propose an amendment to Senator Margetts's motion. It has not been distributed, but I will read it out. It would go at the end of (b), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls on the Commonwealth Government to urgently intervene and force a halt to logging in the Giblett block.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would then add the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . until assessments are made on whether or not the logging is in breach of the Regional Forest Agreement process and whether or not the timber harvested from such forests is being utilised in a way that maximises the employment opportunities in the Pemberton region of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do that because of the very points that I have just made. I may not have the same sentiment and may not agree with some of the pursuits of Senator Margetts with regard to forests, but I do believe that if we cut trees down we ought to ensure that the maximum benefit&mdash;both socially and economically&mdash;is achieved by this country. That certainly is not the case at the moment. Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek your guidance in regard to what I have just proposed as an amendment, whether I can do that and whether it has to be circulated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate for too long. I think these are issues that are important to debate. I know that they  are issues that are taking up an enormous amount of time of the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, part of the reason we are debating this issue today is that processes that are put in place to ensure the orderly management of the Senate have not been observed. One such process is that at whips meetings members of parties, minor parties and Independents are encouraged to inform other members of the Senate what they are likely to do, particularly in relation to matters like notices of motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message we received&mdash;second&hyphen; or third&hyphen;hand, as Senator Margetts was not at the whips meeting last night&mdash;was that it was likely that this motion would be deferred. That did not come from Senator Margetts, because she was not there; it came through another source at the meeting. The best they thought would happen was that it would be deferred. If the whips, and therefore members of other parties, are informed that you intend calling the motion formal, other people can make informed decisions as to whether they would allow formality&mdash;and, therefore, the motion would be put without a vote&mdash;or refuse formality, and then risk a suspension of standing orders. It also gives the party the chance to allow the motion to be called on in general business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's best advice, through our whip Senator Calvert&mdash;and it was not good advice; Senator Calvert admits that it was through second&hyphen;hand sources&mdash;was that you were to defer the motion. As I said to Senator Harradine, these breakdowns in communication can occur. It is very hard, I know, par
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ticularly in your own position at that end of the chamber. Senator Harradine, as you were involved in the superannuation debate virtually all day yesterday&mdash;as I was&mdash;you would realise that it is often hard to get messages backwards and forwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, if Senator Hill could be here to debate this matter, he would. I am here both as the Manager of Government Business and as a former parliamentary secretary to the Minister for the Environment. I had a very close involvement with the Minister for the Environment in the months between the election and the middle of November when I was transferred to Treasury. I took the opportunity&mdash;indeed, I saw it as my responsibility&mdash;to involve myself as closely as possible in the forest issues, particularly in my home state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Bob Brown about the importance of all members of the parliament, particularly Western Australians, visiting the south&hyphen;west forests. I encourage all people of Australia, if they have the opportunity to come across to Western Australia&mdash;encouraged by people like Elle McPherson, I suspect&mdash;to travel south. It is a magnificent part of the world. It is a long way away from the rest of the world, and that in many respects is a way in which the environment is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am referring obliquely to the tourism aspects of that region of the world&mdash;which I know is very close to Senator Murray's heart&mdash;I should mention that I took the opportunity, in preparing to debate his motion on the Greater Beedelup National Park late last year, to get some figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to tourism in that region. I will not incorporate or even table this document, because it is all over the place, but if Senator Murray or other honourable senators want to get information about tourism in that region, the ABS publication that applies is ABS Cat. No. 8635.5. It relates to the number of guest arrivals and commercial accommodation in the shire of Manjimup.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document may not be all that encompassing for the south&hyphen;west, but it certainly relates to the region where the Giblett block,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2892"> the Greater Beedelup National Park and the other magnificent areas of old forest are nearby. The figures show that, between the years 1986-87 and the latest year for which we were able to get figures, there has been close to a doubling in the number of tourists travelling to that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having visited the area over Easter&mdash;I do not know whether this is due to CALM or good management or whatever&mdash;I noticed that there was an incredible number of people. I was quite pleased to see that, because of the infrastructure and because of the way businesses are developing down there, it seemed&mdash;particularly in the Margaret River through to Pemberton area&mdash;the area was able to cope with that tourist influx. I guess Easter would be a fairly heavy time for people travelling down south in Western Australia. It did not seem to be inconvenient anywhere we went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how much tourism activity we can take in the south&hyphen;west without putting pressure on both the infrastructure and, most importantly, the environment. I am sure that the many small businesses and tourist operators in the Pemberton, Manjimup and south&hyphen;west region would love to see more and more tourists visit the region so they can share in the delights of south&hyphen;west Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point because many commentators, Senator Murray, Senator Brown and Senator Margetts have on occasions said that you really have to protect all of Giblett block or all of the old&hyphen;growth forests in that area to ensure that tourism is viable. The figures on native forest harvesting in that area, particularly in relation to jarrah and karri, show that the harvesting that is taken on there has stayed almost constant&mdash;it goes up and down year on year, but in terms of the amount of forest area that is harvested from 1986 to 1995 it has remained constant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I refer to the source of the figures rather than table this document. The source is the CALM 1995-96 annual report. It shows that the areas harvested do fluctuate up and down, but the total amount of karri and jarrah forests felled has for all statistical purposes stayed fairly constant.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pluck some figures out to make my argument more cohesive. For example, in 1996, 19,340 hectares of jarrah forest and about 1,090 hectares of karri forest were felled. In 1989, 15,000 hectares of jarrah&mdash;give or take a few hectares&mdash;and about 1,500 of karri were harvested. In 1994, about 14,000 hectares of jarrah and about 1,400 hectares of karri were harvested. So there were fairly consistent levels of harvesting of those native forests, but in the meantime tourism nearly doubled&mdash;from 66,000 to over 116,000. The point I am making in a tortuous way is that tourism potential&mdash;that is, the broadening of economic activity in the region&mdash;and native forest harvesting are compatible. One does not exclude the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the Giblett block. It is a very important part of that region. I had the great pleasure of visiting the area with Roger Cheeseman. Senator Brown referred to the people who were fighting to save the forests in the south-west as great Australians. I share his sentiment particularly in relation to Roger Cheeseman. I think he is a great Australian. I also think he is very dedicated to his cause and that he is a most reasonable man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far I can, I have tried to keep lines of communication open between him and the Minister for the Environment, both in Western Australia and in Canberra. I am sure that we will never deliver everything that Roger wants nor deliver everything that the Greens (WA) would want in relation to Giblett block.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You're supporting the motion, are you? All this leads to you supporting the motion, does it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not. I am just about to say why this motion does not help either Western Australia or the cause. I am trying to say that it is compatible to have tourism operations and a whole range of other activities in the south-west of Western Australia with native forest harvesting. The reality, which you would not be able to glean from what has been contributed to the debate to date, is that, under the deferred forests agreement, something like 4,000 hectares of Giblett block have been set aside and that 460 hectares in the Giblett block&mdash;about an eighth
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2893"> of the whole block&mdash;will be available for logging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point honourable senators should be aware of is that the comprehensive regional assessment process that is being undertaken in south&hyphen;western Australia is designed to move that part of Australia into a reserve system which will create a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system&mdash;which is the CAR acronym. The aim of that is to create a world-class forest reserve system. Its aim is to look at all of the factors&mdash;scientific factors, biodiversity factors, all of the various attributes of forests and their ecosystems&mdash;and to create a comprehensive  system across Australia&mdash;in this case, in Western Australia&mdash;to bring about a preservation of 15 per cent of pre-1750 distribution of forest communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite contrary to what Senator Brown said about making Australia an international pariah in relation to protecting forests and wild forests, that puts us 50 per cent above the IUCN's benchmark. As Senator Brown would know better than just about everybody else in this place, that benchmark was that you should save 10 per cent of those forests. Australia has sought to preserve 15 per cent&mdash;50 per cent higher than the international standard. Senator Brown may wish to see 100 per cent or a much higher level achieved, but to say that Australia's forest management systems and the Commonwealth's way of trying to coordinate them between the states make us an international pariah is simply not accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system, which we believe will create a world-class forest reserve system, will also achieve 60 per cent protection of old growth, 90 per cent protection of wilderness and 100 per cent protection of rare and endangered plant communities. They are the objectives. To get back to the mandate argument that Senator Brown put into his contribution, they are objectives that were set out quite clearly in the coalition's policies before the last election. We said that we supported the national forest policy statement. We said that we would proceed down this track of doing a comprehensive, scientifically based analysis of the forests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional agreements will allow for sustainable use of the forests for generations into the future. That will be an incredible achievement when it is pulled off by the Minister for the Environment and his state colleagues. It will see an outstanding set of agreements and arrangements in place to protect forests in perpetuity and to ensure that business and harvesting can take place at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process is tedious. It requires an enormous amount of work on the ground, an enormous amount of work in negotiations with the industries, conservation groups, scientists and state governments. But we do hope to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not want to hold the Senate up any longer but, before concluding, I would make these remarks. This process was put in place by the previous government. Therefore, I would be very surprised if opposition senators were to support a motion which effectively condemns a policy that was established by Paul Keating when they were in government. The Keating government sought to negotiate a regional agreement in this area with the Court government, but failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That agreement was put in place within about four months of this government coming to power. It ensured that significant areas were deferred from logging activity. Indeed, when Minister Cheryl Edwards in Western Australia announced recently the fact that logging would proceed in this relatively small part of Giblett block&mdash;and I will put it in context: of 4,000 hectares, just over 460 hectares are to be logged&mdash;she announced the protection of a further 10,000 hectares of forest in the Blackwood valley, pending assessment under this process. And I did not see Senator Brown getting up in the Senate and congratulating Minister Cheryl Edwards for making that announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, I state that the coalition will not support the amendment you have moved. I am informed that logging is occurring in only one-third of the block, which is allowed under the deferred forest agreement and the voluntary agreement and, therefore, it is fully in accordance with the RFA process. So that makes your motion somewhat redundant.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2894">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be opposing the motion moved by Senator Margetts. We believe that it is quite possible to have logging take place within the Giblett block and still preserve the very important biodiversity and other qualities of that forest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In winding up this debate, I would thank all of those senators who have participated in it. I did not necessarily expect there to be a debate. I would apologise in relation to the whips meeting. Yes, I was in the chamber and, as to our lateness in advising people, we obviously circulated the motion asking for support for formality. But our lateness in advising was due to the fact that it really, literally, was not until I got to the chamber that I found out whether or not the opposition would support the motion. So I do apologise for not giving earlier notice; it was not intentional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell) gave some interesting figures: 460 hectares out of around 4,000 hectares. He also gave some figures for the logging of Giblett jarrah and karri over the years of 1986 to 1994. It does not take too much maths to work out that, if you were to log a 4,000&hyphen;hectare block at 460 hectares a year, within 10 years you would have no block left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is an important area, and Senator Campbell has agreed that it is an important area. But even at over one&hyphen;tenth of that important area being logged a year, it does not take 10 years to get rid of the whole lot. What does that mean for those in the tourism industry? They do not accept the fact that they should put up with more than one&hyphen;tenth of their precious resource going each year. They are just watching with horror and grief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it really is a grieving process when people realise that we are speaking of trees that have been growing for hundreds of years&mdash;trees that were growing as forest way before European settlement of Western Australia. That is what we are talking about. There is very little that can console people with that form of grief when they see these sorts of figures being thrown around and they
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are told, `Don't worry, it's only 460 hectares out of a 4,000&hyphen;hectare block.' That is a terrible thing to say to people who actually believe they are part of their environment and the land around them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would indicate that Pauline McLeod from the South&hyphen;West Regional Tourism Association has issued her own statement condemning the logging in Giblett. Obviously, she does not share the confidence of Senator Campbell that, in fact, this level of logging is not damaging the tourism industry. Personally, I do not know that we should aim for lots more tourism; we should aim to have a properly managed tourism industry, like any industry. However, we are talking about an existing industry that already employs thousands of people, so we are talking about resource security for those people who already exist and work in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned in the motion, in 1995 woodchips from the Giblett block were exported illegally by Bunnings, and there were no sanctions. One wonders whether or not the companies involved in Western Australia feel that they can do whatever they like, despite the ecological implications&mdash;and sometimes despite the legal implications&mdash;if governments will not act. This is the challenge that exists right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, 1995 was a different government. Therefore, this government can show their spots and say, `Okay, this is what we're going to do: we're going to go in and say, yes, if it's an interim listing on the Register of the National Estate, destroying more than one&hyphen;tenth a year of a forest that takes, by conservative estimates'&mdash;if you ever could replace it&mdash;`150 years to develop its values to the extent they can even support parrot life'&mdash;for heaven's sake&mdash;`then we have to say that this is not in any way, shape or form under anyone's definition sustainable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mention of Manjimup and Roger Cheeseman was interesting because there are people who obviously are very, very concerned about their future employment in the area. But there are areas like Pemberton where you have the Gloucester tree which, for some reason, has been pulled out of use. Some people unkindly suggest that the reason
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2895"> the Gloucester tree is not being used as a tourist resource any more is that, when you go up the Gloucester tree, you can see how much destruction there has been to the surrounding forest. So you cannot take tourists up there. It is not like the side of the road where you can have tourists driving along, observing a relatively narrow band and thinking that they still have forests. If you go up the tree and look from there, you can find out how much is being destroyed. This cannot be replaced in the near future. So, yes, the resource that this industry needs is being destroyed in front of their eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Campbell might like to talk to, if he has not already done so, Pauline  McLeod from the South-West Regional Tourism Association. People are having to cope with grief. I understand people are concerned about their future in relation to the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been willing to talk to groups&mdash;perhaps meetings of shop stewards&mdash;in relation to the industry. In the south-west we have had some meetings with people from the community, but so far I have never had a meeting where there has been access to the people who represent the workers in the industry and been able to talk to them, listen to their concerns and answer their questions. I would be very happy to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Dr Christine Sharp, a newly elected member of the Western Australian Legislative Council who represents the south-west, is also vitally concerned about issues relating to the environment and employment in that region and would like to do that. In public I put on notice that I would love to face a room full of shop stewards from, for instance, the forest products union in the south-west and talk through the issues and about their future, what lies ahead and ways we can all work together for a more sustainable future in the south-west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy's amendment deals with `until assessments are made on whether or not the logging is in breach of the regional forest agreement process'. I understand what is behind Senator Murphy's amendment. I also understand that the RFA process in Western Australia is considered to be very problemat
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ic. The environment movement have, in large part, pulled out of the forest assessment process is Western Australia. That process has two parts: an advisory committee, which is largely ignored in the process, and a main committee. And guess what? Neither tourism nor the environment movement are part of that main committee.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nor is small business, as Senator Murray has indicated. If a process is looking at the impacts on industry, surely it must involve industries that have some connection with the forests concerned. Even the wine industry could have because the people who come down to see the forests also go to the wineries to buy a bottle of wine&mdash;and they do other things at the same time. For some reason tourism, small business and the environment movement have been cut out of that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an assumption that there is only one industry that is important, and this is not necessarily the industry that is creating the most employment in the region. We are talking about the need for resource security in the industry, yet a whole lot of people have been cut out of the process. The process is certainly flawed. I would find it difficult to go along with `until assessments are made on whether or not it is in breach of the regional forest agreement process' because I know that from many people's viewpoints the RFA process in Western Australia is in deep trouble. We would like to see something done about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is `whether or not the timber harvested from such forests is being utilised in a way that maximises the employment opportunities in the Pemberton region of Western Australia'. Of course, 460 hectares a year coming out of a 4,000 hectare block will not employ many for very long anyway, so I find it difficult to support that as a particularly value-adding prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we should look at the many ways&mdash;and I have indicated this in part to Senator Murphy&mdash;we can create employment and value add in the forest industry and timber industry in Australia, especially in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2896"> relation to timber products. That needs to be worked up. I would be happy to work with Senator Murphy or other senators to put a motion on that issue to the Senate in the future. I do not think this will help if the government is, through the Department of Conservation and Land Management, unsustainably harvesting this forest, as it obviously is, because there will be no jobs, sustainable or otherwise, for this forest in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank once again those people who participated in the debate. I would like to think that the Commonwealth will heed the call not to dodge their responsibilities in the forest process and that this debate has enabled some of those issues to be aired.

<PARA STYLE="Para">There it refers to the introduction of the guillotine to force through the industrial relations legislation before the democratically elected members of the new upper house take their seats on 22 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter of urgency today deals with this as far as the Australian Senate is concerned. We are now in the 96th consecutive day in which the Western Australian government has not filled the constitutional vacancy created when Senator Panizza, a distinguished Liberal senator in this place, passed away in January
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this year. Ninety-six days have passed with Western Australia being represented not by the statutory requirement of 12 senators but by a lesser requirement of 11 senators. This is the 25th day of the sitting of this Senate chamber in which that situation has remained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that this is, by the Liberal government here nationally as well as by the Liberal government in Western Australia, a cynical and contemptuous approach to the needs and wishes of Western Australian voters, to the constitutional conventions that underpin our democracy, to the Australian Senate itself in the need to be representative of the states' interests and to fair and democratic procedures in Western Australia. We canvassed this a little earlier today, so I will do this in summary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know there are two real reasons why the Western Australian government is behaving in this manner. Senator-elect Lightfoot was pre-selected on 5 April by the Liberal Party in Western Australia after two attempts to pre-select him. He was pre-selected on 5 April. He could have then been notified and could have been here in this parliament for this sitting. He hung on, and he hung on until at least 21 April in order to achieve a superannuation payment of $466,000, after being a member of that chamber for seven years. There was clearly self-motivation in his hanging on for that part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just in the last weeks Senator-elect Lightfoot, member of the Legislative Council, said that he was going to remain in that chamber so he could vote for the industrial legislation that the editors of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> have condemned in their editorial today as cynical and autocratic. On advice to me this afternoon as well, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, I understand, have called upon the Court government to withdraw that legislation from the Legislative Council. In other words, legislation which is inherently undemocratic, which is inherently anti-union and which is inherently anti-ordinary working men and women in Western Australia is being asked to be withdrawn by the employers' organisation in that state so that a Liberal government can
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2898"> cease the divisiveness that that legislation is causing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the facts of this matter? The facts are these, plainly. No mandate was sought by the Liberal Party in Western Australia for the third wave of industrial legislation when they presented their credentials to the electors in that state for the December 1996 election. In fact, they denied it was their intention to come forward with the third wave in the election. So there is no mandate, clearly, from the Western Australia people for this legislation to proceed. The legislative councillors who were elected at that election take their seats on 22 May. The will of the electors in that state in that election composed the Legislative Council in a manner in which the government in that state has no majority and in which it is clear that if that legislation were presented to that chamber under those people who were elected at the last state election it would not pass. So the government has attempted to ram this legislation through, taking advantage of the temporary expediency of a one&hyphen;seat majority between now and the 22nd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I say, Ross Lightfoot was pre-selected on 5 April. The Liberal Party, if we are to believe the Premier of Western Australia, have not yet told the Western Australian government that Ross Lightfoot has been elected. As a consequence, the Western Australian government say that they cannot call the required meeting of joint houses to nominate him to fill this Senate vacancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have the Liberal Party deliberately delayed? Quite clearly in order to maintain their majority in the Legislative Council, to maintain a majority to ram this undemocratic, anti-worker legislation through, to divide the opinion in that state and then at their leisure to send Senator-elect Lightfoot to Canberra to represent the interests of Western Australians. This is, as I say, contemptuous of the interests of Western Australians and of Western Australia's need to be properly represented in this place. In other words, Lightfoot has not taken up his seat because the Western Australian Liberal Party have directly manipulated the constitutional conventions and the votes
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both in Western Australia and here in order to score a point on their political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a new matter for the Senate. The Senate has debated this matter in the past when state governments were tardy in nominating their representatives for Canberra. Indeed, in the most recent debate, many Western Australian senators who now sit opposite spoke long and passionately about the need for the Lawrence government to speed up the process of filling the vacancy created by then Senator Jo Vallentine so that Senator Chamarette could take her place. There was a 41&hyphen;day delay between the vacancy created by the retirement of Senator Vallentine and the appointment of Senator Chamarette. There has now been a 96&hyphen;day delay in the appointment of a replacement for Senator Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have these same Western Australian senators expressed themselves with the same urgency and passion as they did when they attacked the former Labor government? Of course not. In fact, on the contrary: they have defended the actions of the Court government. They did so earlier this afternoon in what to me was a disgusting reversal of their earlier position, and one which does them absolutely no credit. The facts of this matter are best explained by going to what those senators said. Senator Campbell, who represents the government as Manager of Government Business in this chamber, had a lot to say back when this debate was on. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude by saying that there are only three possible motivations:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to the alleged delay of the Lawrence government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the first, bloody minded obstruction; secondly, mismanagement and disorganisation of the sort that was shown recently in relation to the sewerage plant under the One nation program; or, thirdly, a total disrespect for the Senate and the people of Western Australia and their representation in this place. I join Senator Coulter in condemning the actions of the Premier of Western Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Have we heard Senator Campbell condemn the actions of the Premier of Western Australia and his even more blatant abuse? Of course we have not. He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2899">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Western Australia does not have full representation in this place, it has been let down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that same debate he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notice that the Western Australian Parliament and the Western Australian Government have given makes it even more of a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know that Senator Campbell lobbied long and hard not for Mr Lightfoot but for Michael Huston to become the replacement senator. In fact, we know that when ringing his Liberal Party cronies to get the vote for his favoured nominee&mdash;the one supported by the Howard government&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vote for Lightfoot is a vote against me!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On two occasions the Western Australian Liberal Party voted for Lightfoot and, on the last occasion, voted in greater numbers than previously. I guess I have to say there seems to be a crisis of confidence in Senator Campbell in Western Australia. If he puts up next time and the same votes come out, he will not be in this place again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Susan Knowles had a lot to say in that debate as well. In the debate earlier today she spoke in defence of the actions of the state government and tried to draw a red herring across the path. But what did she say when she spoke last time? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reveals she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next time there is a Senate vacancy may well not be a time that is chosen by a retiring Senator&mdash;it could be due to ill health, death, or a number of other reasons. On that occasion, it may be politically convenient for a State Government to leave a Federal Government or, in fact, a Federal Opposition, short of a Senator for as long as possible when contentious legislation is before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prophetic remarks: there is contentious legislation before the Western Australian Legislative Council. Senator Knowles knows full well and said many years ago&mdash;back in 1992&mdash;that in those circumstances a government may be rendered vulnerable. I wonder out loud whether that is the sort of thinking that has now been incorporated in the Liberal Party's actions over Ross Lightfoot. Referring to the decision of the Lawrence government, Senator Knowles went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an insult to the Senate, a denial of representation to all Western Australians, injustice to certain
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> individuals and a sinister precedent in defiance of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Her words. But have we heard that from her in condemning this action of the government? Of course we have not. We have heard a contrary view&mdash;a defence of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this urgency motion must be carried is for the sake of this Senate stamping its seal of consistency upon the filling of vacancies in this chamber, and not allowing its honourable motives in pairing senators in this place to be held up to abuse and manipulation for gross, and in this case divisive, state political purposes. That is what is happening. The industrial legislation in Western Australia is divisive in that state. A demonstration by some 30,000 workers occurred on Wednesday last week, indicating mass support against this legislation.

We have reaffirmed the principle that these matters should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA preselection process did take longer than it normally would have because there was a technical default in the calling of a meeting, which was rectified. That gave most of the state councillors of the Liberal Party who sit on that preselection body a pain in the neck to put it lightly because they had to come back from all parts of the state to do the process again because of a default. In fact I am informed by Mr Wells, the state director of the Liberal Party, that if that default had not been corrected then the nomination of Mr Lightfoot would have been technically incorrect and voidable. They are matters I would like to clear up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other more light&hyphen;hearted matter is that Senator Cook says that I lobbied people in relation to the preselection, that I said words to the effect that a vote for Lightfoot is a vote against me. I am not sure whether that was ever published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> or whether the walls in No. 2, The Esplanade, Perth are thinner than I think. I certainly do not recall saying words to that effect. They are words that I do not believe because I know they are not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the details of the motion moved by Senator Cook, one of the core issues that has not had a lot of focus put on it is the issue of the legitimacy of the Legislative Council of Western Australia dealing with legislation before 21 May. Between 29 April 1996 when the Senate resumed last year after the March election when there was a landslide victory to the coalition parties in the House of Representatives&mdash;and a very good Senate vote, might I add&mdash;and 28 June 1996
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the Senate adjourned for the last time prior to the expiration of senators' terms on 30 June last year a number of senators retired from this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall our dear former colleagues Michael Beahan, Brian Burns and John Coates all retired at 30 June 1997 as did Senator Robert Bell, Senator Sid Spindler and my good friend Christabel Chamarette. Not once in that period&mdash;and that is a period of something like 25 sitting days&mdash;were any doubts raised as to whether it was valid for people who had not been elected at the 1996 election, who had been elected at previous elections or, in Christabel's case, brought in on a casual vacancy, to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats who are making a big hullabaloo in Western Australia about the fact it is immoral that the Legislative Council as it is now configured should be discussing any legislation at all is quite amazing when you note that in that period last year&mdash;I remind senators and anyone else who happens to be tuned in listening to this debate&mdash;after the March election when you had this massive landslide to the coalition and we sat up to the expiration of terms of senators on 30 June 1996, these people voted and voted regularly. What did they mostly do in divisions, Senator Knowles?</PARA>

What they are really saying is: close the Legislative Assembly down till 21 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They believe in having fixed terms for both parliaments so you cannot have early elections and everything. You have a fixed term in the Legislative Council in Western Australia. The new terms begin on 22 May&mdash;it is a very important date in Australian history because it is my birthday. Here in the Senate the terms expire on 30 June and the new terms start on 1 July. We have fixed terms.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2901"> What the Democrats and I presume others, Senator Cook and Senator Evans, are saying in this motion is that perhaps the whole place should be closed down after the election and before the new senators take their place because they have no legitimate democratic right to vote on a piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that when people go to the ballot-box, legislative councillors are elected for a fixed term. I am not so silly as to suggest that every time someone casts a ballot they know all the provisions of the Electoral Act and the Western Australian and federal constitutions. The reality is that that is what is being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Murray that on 27 occasions in that short time last year the Democrats voted in divisions against the government on a whole range of crucial issues. The Greens (WA) voted against the government in 26 divisions and the ALP senators voted in 24 divisions against the government in that period. The same ALP senators who voted on 24 occasions this time last year against the government, which had been elected by the second biggest landslide in Australian history, who voted against legislation that was part of our mandate, part of our agenda, are now coming in here today saying that it is undemocratic, wrong, unconstitutional or even immoral for the Legislative Council in Western Australia to consider legislation that is before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to Senator Murray's rebuttal of that argument. I do not think there can be one. There is clear hypocrisy for someone who says that you cannot deal with legislation. These issues are not new matters. These matters have been before the Western Australia people for a long time. Everyone says that the secret ballot issue is irrelevant, that it is just a red herring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that most Western Australians agree on, regardless of where they come from&mdash;there is absolutely overwhelming support for it. When it comes to taking industrial action that closes down the whole of Western Australia, which is what the trade union leaders did to Western Australia last week&mdash;schools were closed down&mdash;they do

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not know the man well, because I was a new senator, but my belief is that this long delay is an affront to the memory of the very diligent, committed and hardworking Senator Panizza. I know that Senator Panizza had the view that Western Australian senators needed to be here, they needed to be here in numbers and they needed to be here representing their state's interests. It is quite wrong for Western Australia to be without one of its senators for nearly 100 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some of the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell). First of all, he has started with a premise which is utterly wrong. He said that the Democrats have said that no legislation at all should be debated in the Legislative Council. We are not allowed to say that that is a lie, so I think I would have to say that it is a misrepresentation. If you wish to misrepresent us, please misrepresent us correctly. We have said that, if there is to be legislation which is utterly divisive and is  going to cause a great deal of `aggro' in the community, then it should be delayed until such time as the new Legislative Council sits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the issue of 22 May. It is undoubtedly true, as everyone in the chamber and the community at large recognises, that after 22 May this legislation in Western Australia would not have got through in its current form. I want to look at this legislation just briefly in the short time available to me. It was introduced as a third wave. The very conservative <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> describes the third wave of 4 May as a bad wash. I mean, you were even criticised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS>, which is really getting quite difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason it was not needed is that the previous changes to the legislation, by both the Labor government and then the Liberal government following, had resulted in a change in the industrial climate. We had a period where there was remarkably low industrial unrest. What did Premier Court and Mr Kierath do? They managed to turn the place upside down and strike a match to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fires of industrial passions. You have to say to yourself, `What extraordinarily incompetent people. What an extraordinarily unnecessary action to take.' Not only was it incompetent and unnecessary; it also is going to cost businesses and workers hundreds of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to contrast that with three other people: Premier Carr, Premier Borbidge and Prime Minister Howard. The three of them introduced far more far&hyphen;reaching industrial legislation without one single moment of industrial unrest. Do not quote to me the awful riot that occurred here in the parliament, because that was a riot by a minority of people at a rally. It was certainly not industrial unrest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and those two premiers introduced legislation which managed to get through their parliaments without the kind of upset we are seeing in WA&mdash;solely because they understood process, they understood consultation, and they understood how to deal with the conflicting aims of the various parties concerned. The result is that all three of them were able to introduce very far&hyphen;reaching legislation without the appalling and unnecessary uproar&mdash;and incompetence&mdash;that has gone on in WA. Really, if you as Liberals want to indict your Premier, you have to do so based on his being an appallingly poor manager of this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that it was only following the visits of Minister Peter Reith to WA that they then&mdash;once Graham Kierath was away&mdash;started to call in other people to consult with them about changes and amendments. This was after they had inflamed passions with their poor legislation, and the poor provisions of the legislation, to such an extent that it has become almost impossible to manage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear Senator Campbell talking with passion about secret ballots. The unions do not oppose secret ballots. The community does not oppose secret ballots. The Democrats do not oppose secret ballots. Labor does not oppose secret ballots. The Liberals do not oppose secret ballots. The Nationals do not oppose secret ballots. The difference is about the process&mdash;it is incompetent; it is useless;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2903"> it is pathetic. They have introduced legislation which was unnecessary. But they could have got it through if they had managed process properly. I think the real disgrace in this whole exercise is that the beating of their respective manly chests is going to result in a cost to WA of hundreds of millions of dollars of wasted money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us turn to Senator-elect Lightfoot. If Senator-elect Lightfoot had been elected by the members of the Liberal Party, I would have thought that would be a great feat. But he was elected, I understand, by a little over 100 people in the extremely rigged, factionalised, divided group.

We are not debating the industrial relations bill that is before the Western Australian parliament. I wish we were. I, indeed, would have something to say about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available to me, I am not running away from that debate. I am going to concentrate on the matter that is before the Senate. That is, of course, the following motion put forward by Senator Cook on behalf of Senator Chris Evans:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Western Australian State Government to appoint Ross Lightfoot to replace the late John Panizza, which is motivated by nothing more than political expediency and is a desperate attempt by the Court Government to pass oppressive industrial relations legislation before the will of the people as expressed in the December election is reflected in the composition of the Western Australian Legislative Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the subject matter before us. However, there is a diversion&mdash;Senator Campbell's red herring when he tried to draw an analogy between what happens post&hyphen;elections in the Legislative Council in Western Australia and the Senate of the Parliament of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell conveniently forgot to tell the Senate and those people who are listening that last year was the first occasion when the Western Australian elections were held early. The Western Australian elections are normally held&mdash;and have been since the parliament of Western Australia was established in a democratic fashion&mdash;in February-March and on one occasion in April. This year, the election was held in December. Mr Court picked a good time and he was justly rewarded with an overwhelming victory in the lower house. But he did not have an overwhelming victory in the upper house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is unique about Western Australian elections is that they are normally held in February&hyphen;March&mdash;and as I said, on one occasion in April&mdash;and then the new parliament generally does not meet until after the new Legislative Council is sworn in. On this occasion, all of the conventions have been broken, as they have been broken on previous occasions by the Court government in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, for the first time ever, in a house that has never been controlled by other than a Liberal Party in Western Australia, they used a gag and a guillotine to get legislation through. On that occasion, the legislation they were seeking to get through had to do with the Mabo legislation. It was subsequently tossed out as being wrong and bad legislation by the High Court of Australia. They have tried it again with the second wave of industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2904">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last evening in the upper house of the parliament of Western Australia, to the continued disgrace of the Court government, they tried it again. They have again broken all the conventions that are in existence. But last night there was a cost. The cost, which Senator Knowles came and reported to us in an earlier debate in this place, is that the pairs have been withdrawn. No pairs exist because the convention has been broken. It has not been broken by the Labor Party. It has not been broken by the other Independents in the upper house in Western Australia. It was broken by the Court government in the Legislative Council in Western Australia. It was broken and they are suffering the consequences of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That red herring has to be firmly put to bed. There is no direct analogy between what happens following the election of the Legislative Council in Western Australia and the election of senators to the parliament of Australia. On a number of occasions we have had elections in December of one year with new senators not taking their position until July of the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually take some pleasure in the honourable Ross Lightfoot MLC coming to this place. He is, after all, currently one of my local members of parliament&mdash;together with  Ian Maclean and Richard Evans. I do not know what we have done wrong over in Wanneroo, but we are paying for some mistakes in the past. I hope we enjoyed the sins we have probably committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to Ross Lightfoot coming into this place. Any person who is brave enough to publicly call their leader a traitor and who is on the opposite side of parliament to me is probably somebody you would listen to when he finally takes his place in the Senate where parliamentary privilege is attached. That is one of the many things that the honourable Ross Lightfoot is on the record for. He has called people&mdash;including his leader and most of his colleagues in the Western Australian parliament and some here&mdash;traitors because they support the imposition of a royalty on the mining of gold.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I look forward to Ross coming here. I think that, whilst he is a virulent debater&mdash;and we will certainly test his mettle on this side of the chamber&mdash;at the end of the day he will create more problems for that side of the  chamber than he will for this side of the chamber. That is probably the reason why so many of my Western Australian parliamentary colleagues worked so vigorously in the two preselections in March and April of this year to try to get a different person preselected to come to Canberra as a representative of Western Australia. That was a bit of fun on my part, but it is not really fun at all&mdash;as the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> went on to point out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are becoming a pretty sick state in Western Australia when the will of the people, as expressed democratically in the elections that were held in December last year, has just been turned over for blatant political reasons. That has not gone unnoticed. The demonstration last Tuesday by the trade union movement, workers and the community in Western Australia vividly brought that to the notice of all Australians. What the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> had to say today, and I want to quote only a small part of it to make the point about Mr Lightfoot, is this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breathtaking display of arrogance and contempt for the people's vote in December and for the proper role of the Council as a House of review. It completely ignores recommendations of august bodies, such as the WA royal commission and the Commission on Government, which urged that the review role of the Upper House should be strengthened to help prevent the executive riding roughshod over Parliament and the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's contempt for what is proper procedure is further illustrated by its decision to keep Senator&hyphen;elect Ross Lightfoot&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">it should really be Senator&hyphen;designate Lightfoot because he has not been elected&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the Legislative Council long after convention says he should have resigned and gone to the Senate. The only reason is that it needs his vote to beat the May 22 deadline.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The other matter that could have been inserted in that editorial is the little matter of $466,000 in a superannuation payment which became available to Mr Lightfoot after he had
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2905"> served till 21 April this year. Mr Lightfoot can now legitimately and lawfully put that in his pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being done to the standing of parliament&mdash;not only this house, which has taken its fair share of battering in recent weeks and months, but all parliaments and indeed the whole parliamentary process&mdash;when you see incidents like this happening? Lumping the two together, is it any wonder how low the people of Australia hold us as professional elected politicians? Is it any wonder indeed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to Senator Knowles's contribution to the debate because I too, like Senator Cook, went to the old <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and revisited the debates that occurred at the time that our colleague, Senator Chamarette, came into this place. Senator Knowles, I know how we felt at that time, some 34 days from when the vacancy arose, about the fact that that vacancy had not been filled. We, as Western Australians, felt distraught that there were only 11 of us to do the work of 12. That time frame has now doubled and there are more days on top of it. I have got a list of the vacancies that have occurred in the last 20 years or so, which I will seek to have incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This list explains how long it has taken at various times to fill casual vacancies of the Senate, whether they have been caused by resignation or by death.  I seek leave to have that list incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining the debate, I have to say that this motion has everything to do with the attitude of the Labor Party not being able to come to grips with losing elections, both federal and state, and little to do with any deeply felt and long&hyphen;abiding concern for full Liberal Party representation in any parliament of Australia. We have seen bullying and blocking and a misuse of committee tactics in this parliament by this opposition since its members were comprehensively wiped out last year in the election. We are now seeing them refuse to accept the will of Western Australian voters for the Western Australian parliament. That is where Senator Evans's motion is remarkable. In the second&hyphen;last line, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . before the will of the people as expressed at the December election is reflected in the composition of the Western Australian Legislative Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate deserves to be reminded of the election result because last December the election saw the number of Liberal seats increase by three, from 26 to 29, whereas Labor lost five seats, resulting in the number reducing from 24 to 19. The National Party maintained its six seats in the assembly. That is the worst result the Labor Party has ever had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the Legislative Council. While we might have lost 0.3 of a percentage vote in the Legislative Council, we actually lost only one seat in the council; the Labor Party lost two. Here we have a combination of the Labor Party and the trade union movement blocking the will of the people. It was a resounding victory for a coalition government, and what have we seen since? Anything to stop it. The other substantive thing that the motion has at its core is the subject of the much&hyphen;needed industrial relations overhaul. Let us not forget that the Hon. Ross Lightfoot would be here with us today if the Labor Party could ever be trusted to keep its word on anything, and that includes the question of pairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Senate of what the Labor Party did back in 1993 when an industrial relations bill was being debated in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Legislative Council in Western Australia. They called off pairs. It just so happens that the very person in question today, Mr Lightfoot, was affected by Labor's actions then. He was in hospital with pneumonia. He had to have a drip taken out, get out of hospital and into the chamber, vote and return to hospital. Is it any wonder that the coalition believed that the Labor Party would do exactly what it did last night, and that was to call off pairs, because, in every industrial relations debate, that is exactly the course of action that it has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, there is a mechanism for the replacement of a member who, for whatever reason, leaves the Legislative Council. Due to a number of circumstances&mdash;sadly, including once again another death&mdash;the Liberal Party has run out of eligible people to fill such a vacancy if Mr Lightfoot were to leave. I might add that the person who has filled the vacancy for the Liberal Party over the last few months is the Hon. Alan Carstairs. The Labor Party and trade unions have had the gall to say that Mr Carstairs should not exercise his vote in this debate on the industrial relations bill. What they have failed to mention is that they have actually replaced three people and have three people in the Legislative Council filling vacancies. At no stage have they said that those three people should not exercise their vote. So, yet again, we deal with a double standard, and the double standard from the Labor Party just never seems to stop.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CAMPBELL" NAMEID="H15">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a triple standard in that case.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, Senator Campbell. However, there is a further demonstration of Labor's refusal to accept that defeat. As I mentioned, they got walloped at the state election in December. In fact, it was the biggest defeat that they had ever suffered in Western Australia. Yet two Labor senators have come in here tonight and said that we should be looking at exercising the will of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in a debate earlier this afternoon, I am pleased that Senator Evans, as Labor whip in the Senate, has taken an honourable course in pairing the late Senator Panizza, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2908"> I have no doubt that he will continue that course of action, because he is honourable. We are confronted with a great contrast in Western Australia. They have simply said, `No pairs in industrial relations&mdash;it is sacrosanct.' We now have here the other people taking the balance of power&mdash;a couple of Greens and a Democrat&mdash;with no representation in the Legislative Assembly at all, holding Western Australia to ransom. It can hardly be suggested to me or accepted by me that that is exercising the will of the Western Australian vote in the December election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how we are in the situation that we are in today. It is just a quirk of the electoral system for the legislative council that the number of government and non&hyphen;government members is now equal. The Labor Party believes that this entitles them to demand that the business of the government not proceed until the new term of the tied upper house commences on 22 May. What an abuse of the electorate wishes. As Senator Campbell has clearly put up, it did not stop them last year, from March to 30 June, in using every vote that they could possibly muster, with a minority of people in this chamber in terms of each individual party. On their own, the Labor Party cannot defeat the government coalition senators; the Greens certainly cannot; the Democrats certainly cannot. But it did not stop the combination defeating the will of the people in a landslide victory for the Commonwealth government in the March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an abuse of the electorate wishes, as I said before. Mind you, one can never win with the Labor Party. Had the government in Western Australia decided to sit on its hands until 22 May and do nothing, the Labor Party and the trade unions would have been brimming over in their criticism of a government that was inactive. So no matter what the government do, they cannot win, because they have a minority combination that only has a tied vote&mdash;it does not have a majority&mdash;that is demanding that they, single&hyphen;handedly, exercise the will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, if the Labor Party's word could ever be trusted in the Legislative Council or had there been any mechanism for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensuring that pairs that had been promised would be maintained, the Hon. Ross Lightfoot MLC would be Senator Lightfoot today. So do not blame the Liberal Party for the games that the trade unions and the Labor Party play. It is the mates of the Labor Party in the trade union movement who are creating all the problems that we are seeing today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had actually listened to at least part of the contribution that Senator Knowles made when she spoke on taking note of answers today after question time. Apart from the time that I was walking down to the chamber, I was trying to listen to her contribution. The reason I took particular interest was that at least Senator Knowles was honest enough to say that the decision at the moment in relation to Senator&hyphen;elect Lightfoot is about the Liberal Party running out of eligible people to fill vacancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard a number of issues as to why it is necessary to take the political action that is being taken in Western Australia in relation to the industrial relations bill. I put it to you that this is quite different from the official response that has been given by the party which is citing Western Australian constitutional problems. There is a political reason, and that has been stated, as I say, quite honestly, by Senator Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the Senate should well be debating this today. The Greens (WA) are well aware of the implications of a situation where a casual vacancy is not filled promptly. Of course, on 3 June 1993, the Senate passed the following resolution, reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Odgers' </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2909">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> believes that casual vacancies in the Senate should be filled as expeditiously as possible, so that no State is without its full representation in the Senate for any time longer than is necessary;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises that under section 15 of the Constitution an appointment to a vacancy in the Senate may be delayed because the Houses of Parliament of the relevant State are adjourned but have not been prorogued, which, on a strict construction of the section, prevents the Governor of a state making the appointment . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In this case, the parliament of Western Australia has, in fact, been meeting. None of that actually exists, because the election was in December and, of course, the parliament in Western Australia is meeting and trying to push through the industrial relations legislation as has been mentioned. Part (c) of this says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recommends that all State Parliaments adopt procedures whereby their Houses, if they adjourned when a casual vacancy in the Senate is notified, are recalled to fill the vacancy, and whereby the vacancy is filled;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously the Liberal Party has run out of eligible people, but I am sure that as part of the process within the party they would have the ability to know who they are going to use to replace Mr Lightfoot in relation to the state party. Therefore, the relationship with the state constitution is really immaterial. It is a political process that is occurring here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, getting back to that perhaps, there is a new process&mdash;new standing orders&mdash;in the parliament of Western Australia. That process, put in by the government in Western Australia, shows that there are standing orders indicating how bills will be dealt with. It is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like a triage system so they can better deal with their workload. It basically says that if a bill is complex or controversial, there is an automatic referral to a committee so it can be dealt with better and get community feedback.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that this motion is really in two parts.

I will deal with each in turn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, Senator Campbell adequately outlined the aspects of process in the selection of Mr Lightfoot and the process that has been followed by the state government. I think he did that most adequately, and I will not enhance that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Campbell said, brilliantly&mdash;perhaps that as well. The gravamen of this motion is really about the fact that the opposition objects to the state government relying on upper house votes from members whose term will expire on 21 May this year. It is nothing strange to democracy in Australia that you have upper houses
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2910"> with fixed terms. This chamber enjoys such a situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell pointed out that last year we had senators who voted both for and against the government whose terms ran out at the end of June last year, despite there being a change of government some three months before that. I point to former Senators Beahan, Bell, Burns, Jones, Spindler, Teague and Wheelwright. In those situations you had senators participating in votes, particularly Senator Chamarette, who I failed to mention, who exercised a somewhat crucial position in her casting position, yet there was no objection raised then by the opposition in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that in Western Australia at the moment you have Legislative Council members from the ALP in Mr Graham Edwards, Val Ferguson and Doug Wenn whose terms expire on 21 May this year but who, nonetheless, will be voting on this state legislation. How does the opposition base its objection to Mr Lightfoot casting his vote in relation to the WA Labour Relations Amendment Bill 1977? I fail to see how they can rely on any basis at all for such an objection. There is a longstanding practice that in upper houses and in this chamber&mdash;the Senate&mdash;you have members and senators continuing to vote even though their term is shortly to expire. That is in accordance with democracy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where the Western Australian government is six months into its term of office. Is the opposition saying that it should wait until all upper house members from the pre-existing government have left the Legislative Council before it embarks on its legislative program? I think not. To do so would be highly irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect to this motion which deals with the legislation itself, which it cites as being oppressive. I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that the state government in Western Australia went to the polls in December last year telling Western Australians that they intended to complete any incomplete industrial relations reforms. Indeed, the exposure to these bills has therefore come in the form of two sets of election policies in 1992 and 1996. In two election
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> campaigns these have been canvassed. I put it to the Senate that the bill currently before the Western Australian parliament has had a good deal of process, consultation and exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell made a very good point earlier in relation to secret ballots. In response to an address by Senator Murray from the Democrats, Senator Campbell mentioned that in the prior governments&mdash;the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence governments&mdash;in Western Australia, we did not see any move by them for secret ballots in relation to union votes. It is interesting now to see that everybody says they support them, but where was the legislation then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other aspects in relation to the legislation which I believe the Senate should be aware of. Among the various measures there are those that provide union members to direct their political donations to a political party or election candidate of their choice. They will be protected from having their moneys applied for political purposes without their consent. There is also the aspect of employers and employees being able to enter into voluntary WA collective workplace agreements to override relevant federal awards. I put it to the Senate that the state government in Western Australia has been open to consultation and suggestion&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments made in relation to the industrial relations legislation of Western Australia fall flat on their face. I note that Senator Knowles said, quite pointedly, that what the opposition cannot come to grips with is the poor performance that they put up in the last state election. It was a resounding success for the Court government, it increased its majority and it did so on the policies that it put to the people of Western Australia. One of them was its process for industrial relations reform.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Last September and October, I was privileged to lead the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European institutions, the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and the Republic of Ireland. Today I am pleased to be able to table the delegation's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to the European institutions came at an important phase of Australia's relationship with the European Union. At the time of the visit, a number of key issues relevant to that relationship were being debated. The visit provided a timely opportunity to put forward Australia's views in relation to many of those issues. During the numerous debates, meetings and briefings we attended, the delegation highlighted Australia's desire to strengthen its relationship with the European Union. The delegation reinforced Australia's commitment to formalising and expanding that relationship within a properly established agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government side, I was pleased to hear today the announcement that the European Union has dropped its insistence on including a human rights clause in the proposed framework trade and cooperation agreement with Australia. Instead, it now will be dealt with in a separate political declaration annexed to the agreement. This accords with the position argued for by the government members of the delegation in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Issues of concern within the Australian&hyphen;European Union relationship were also raised by the delegation during its visit. Time and again the delegation promoted Australia's support for further trade liberalisation, particularly in relation to agriculture. I thank the members of the delegation for their participation. At every opportunity we reiterated the need for further reform of Europe's common agricultural policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Council of Europe, the delegation represented Australia's interests in the annual debate on OECD activities. We were success
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ful in moving a number of amendments to the final resolution on OECD activities which were adopted at that debate. Those amendments emphasised the importance of labour market reform in tackling the problem of unemployment; the need for a comprehensive and forward looking work program for the World Trade Organisation; support for Secretary&hyphen;General Johnston's reform strategy for the OECD; and the importance of limiting OECD membership to major players in the world economy, with outreach activities to non-members to be focused on mutual benefit rather than eventual membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament will be interested to know that Secretary&hyphen;General Johnston is eager to increase contacts between the OECD and parliamentarians. His ideas are discussed in our report and should be given more detailed consideration. The delegation also gained a better understanding of the issues currently receiving attention in Europe, including economic and monetary union, European Union enlargement and NATO expansion. The delegation is hopeful that the issues in our report will provide a useful insight into these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During its visit, the delegation detected growing European interest in the Asia-Pacific. Chancellor Kohl's recent visit to Australia is a clear example of the increasing importance with which Europe views its relationship with the Asia-Pacific region. In meetings with European parliamentarians and officials, the delegation took every opportunity to emphasise Australia's potential as a bridge between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. The delegation's considered view is that Australia's focus should be neither exclusively east nor exclusively west. Instead, our efforts should be directed to ensuring that we are able to take up the challenges and opportunities offered by a stronger Asia&hyphen;European partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While visiting the European institutions, the delegation also was privileged to attend commemoration ceremonies at World War I and World War II battlefields and cemeteries in Belgium, including the moving Last Post ceremony at the Menin Gate. That was a special moment of the visit and, in its own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2913"> small way, rekindled the spirit of the Australia Remembers campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the delegation notes in the report, each of the ceremonies we attended carried special meaning for the participants. For the local community, such commemorations are a reminder of the sacrifices which were made in their hour of need and an opportunity to continue expressing their gratitude. Despite the passage of time, it is clear that the people of Belgium have not forgotten the assistance which was provided to them by Australia and other allied soldiers. An inscription on one memorial states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They gave their soul to God, their heart to their country and their body to Belgium.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the young people who attended the ceremonies but have not experienced the horrors of war, such commemorations are both a warning about the immense cost of conflict between nations and a message of hope that the freedom and peace which was so bitterly fought for will be preserved. For the delegation, the ceremonies provided the opportunity to join with the local Belgian community in paying tribute to those who sacrificed their lives. By doing so, we delivered the simple message that Australia still remembers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the visit to the European institutions, the delegation travelled to Northern Ireland where we sought to gain a better understanding of political and socioeconomic developments there, including the peace process which is under way. To achieve this objective, the delegation held detailed discussions with political, church, community and business leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come away from Northern Ireland with mixed views about its future prospects. During our visit, the delegation's levels of optimism and despair tended to fluctuate depending on the last person to whom we spoke. Nevertheless, it is clear that among the wider community in Northern Ireland there is a strong desire for peace, even though some political elements are yet to appreciate this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key to the future of Northern Ireland will be the extent to which the next generation of well&hyphen;educated youth can be harnessed to overcome political hurdles and build a more
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperative community which looks forward to shared commitments rather than divided loyalties. Much also will depend on the continuing support for the peace process from the Irish and the British governments and the broader international community. The message from the community through projects such as the International Fund for Ireland must be loud and clear: there is no dividend in continuing conflict; there is only a dividend in peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Republic of Ireland, the delegation not only gained a further perspective on the future of Northern Ireland but also examined ways of broadening the relationship between Australia and Ireland. During its visit, the delegation discovered that Ireland has moved beyond the divisions of the past to forge a strong relationship within the European Union. In economic terms, it has become a Celtic tiger with impressive growth and investment figures. Australia could well be advised to consider the experience of Ireland as an island nation located near a major world economic power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation was pleased to find that a number of Australian companies already have a significant presence in Ireland. The delegation was fortunate to meet with representatives from the Irish subsidiaries of the National Australia Bank and Michell Leather. The delegation also detected strong interest in Australian products, including wines and foods, with various companies already finding a gateway to the larger European Union market through Ireland. The experience of such companies should be considered by those looking to boost Australia's trade with the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegations's visit would not have been possible without the hard work of so many people both in Australia and overseas. The delegation is grateful to all those who contributed to the visit. We are hopeful that our report will contribute to a better understanding of European affairs both in this parliament and in the wider Australian community. This in turn will help to build on the strong relationship which already exists between Australia and the nations of the European Union. I

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee set up the Senate Inquiry into long&hyphen;term unemployment in November 1994. The terms of reference directed the Inquiry to report on trends in long&hyphen;term unemployment and patterns of work and unemployment among older workers. The Inquiry was to examine the causes of long&hyphen;term unemployment, evaluate established programmes for helping long&hyphen;term unemployed people return to work, and consider alternative innovative strategies to increase employment. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Report on the inquiry into long&hyphen;term unemployment</EMPHASIS>  was tabled in the Senate on 26 October 1995. Preparation of the Government Response to the Report was delayed for a number of reasons, including the Federal election in March 1996 and the need to incorporate new policies and initiatives announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report has two sets of recommendations, one of which reflects the views of the majority of the Committee members consisting of Coalition and Democrat Senators, and the other presents the views of the Labor Committee members who were in minority. This Government Response addresses both the majority and minority recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the Senate established the Inquiry, long&hyphen;term unemployment numbers were falling, having peaked at a trend level of 349,000 in September 1993. Even at its most recent low point of 215,000 in May 1996, however, the trend level of long term unemployment was almost twice its level prior to the last recession. Moreover, the recovery in long term unemployment could not be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustained. The pace of economic growth weakened and by June 1995, short term unemployment was growing again. The flow on effect of this growth in short term unemployment is a major reason for the increase in trend long term unemployment numbers which has occurred since May last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's goal is to return the nation to full employment, so that everyone who wants a job will be able to find one. Major elements of the Government's Job Creation Strategy have been implemented or are under development. The Budget is being placed on a more stable footing, which should see the underlying balance return to surplus by 1998&hyphen;99.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy is to concentrate assistance on those jobseekers most disadvantaged in the labour market, namely the long term unemployed and those most at risk of joining this group. Targeting of assistance will be based both on job seekers' individual needs and the level of difficulties they face. Where it is deemed that job seekers' difficulties are so severe as to prevent them from getting a job, they will be eligible for assistance that directly addresses these difficulties under the new Community Support Programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility requirements relating to particular LMPs have recently been streamlined and simplified in line with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Employment Service Advisory Committee (see recommendation 15). Eligibility for LMP assistance is now generally based on job seekers' access to case management and their duration of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Long&hyphen;term unemployed jobseekers who are in receipt of a Department of Social Security (DSS) unemployment allowance or some other type of income support are eligible for case management and LMP assistance, as are new registrants with the Commonwealth Employment Service who are assessed as being particularly disadvantaged and therefore at `high risk' of becoming long&hyphen;term unemployed. In most cases, new registrants who are selected for case management in this way will be receiving some kind of income support assistance from DSS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Jobseeker Screening Instrument (JSI) is an important part of this assessment process. Under the JSI, factors which predispose jobseekers to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2916"> being at `high risk' are given a weighting to reflect the varying effect each has on the jobseeker's employment prospects. The more significant the factor, the higher the weighting it receives. These factors include educational attainment, birth in a non&hyphen;English speaking country, being an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and being aged over 45 years. Other `supplementary factors' which may also be taken into account when assessing whether an unemployed person is at `high risk', include poor motivation, low self esteem and substantial time out of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence to suggest that unemployed jobseekers aged between 35 and 45 years old are particularly disadvantaged solely because of their age. Consequently, this is not one of the factors influencing the assessment of whether or not a jobseeker is at `high risk'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mature age jobseekers who are found to be at `high risk' are, however, immediately eligible for case management and most labour market programmes, including the Jobstart wage subsidy programme which has proven to be particularly effective in assisting mature age people into work. Data from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' 1995&hyphen;96 Annual Report show that 61.3 per cent of Jobstart participants aged 45 years and over had a positive outcome, compared to 56.3 per cent of all Jobstart participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LMP eligibility for jobseekers who are not eligible for case management depends on their duration of unemployment. These jobseekers are immediately eligible for some LMP assistance, such as job search and ancillary assistance. Jobseekers in receipt of a Department of Social Security benefit are immediately eligible for self&hyphen;employment assistance under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. After six months unemployment, all job seekers are eligible for Jobstart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From March 1998 more flexible forms of assistance that are tailored to the individual needs and circumstances of jobseekers will be available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rise tonight to address the latest NBEET report, in this case a review of institutional use of Commonwealth higher education funding, particularly in relation to indigenous students. It is a particularly timely report that examines the progress we have made in indigenous students' participation in the higher education sector. More importantly, it does so looking at the context of higher education funding against a backdrop of recent cuts slashing higher education budgets that we have seen as a consequence of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the report makes a number of recommendations, including the need to further examine the impact of cuts, specifically cuts to operating grants, on a number of target equity groups in our community, particularly the target equity group of Aboriginal and islander students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report notes that there are certain levels of assistance or measures that are designed to assist participation rates of indigenous students in the higher education sector. They include Austudy, Abstudy, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the scholarships that have been promoted by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also notes that cuts to those very areas, in particular Abstudy, and the possibility of taxation of Austudy and Abstudy grants to Aboriginal and islander people as well as restrictions or any cuts to ATAS, the tutorial assistance schemes for indigenous Australians, will severely hinder and severely impact upon participation rates of indigenous students in this higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report suggests further examination of the impact of these cuts and also looks at the issue of HECS. The report quite obviously and blatantly states that any cuts to financial assistance, any cuts to operating grants&mdash;because a lot of these equity measures are financed directly out of operating grants to university institutions&mdash;and any increases to fees and charges&mdash;in particular, the HECS hikes that we have seen recently&mdash;or up-front
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and full cost fees, will impact most harshly on Aboriginal and islander students in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also acknowledges that there is a broad tension between the trend to use performance as a basis for funding, on the one hand, as well as the possibility of reduced access to other funds such as ATAS and Abstudy, on the other. The report also notes that the provision of equity scholarships are strongly supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I talk about equity scholarships, many of you would be aware that the coalition has promoted the idea of 4,000 equity scholarships over the next four years for those students, on merit, who should be involved in higher education but who, for some reason, cannot afford the fees that are currently being charged. Apart from that, all we know is that the scholarships will be determined by institutions. We do not know of any guidelines surrounding these particular scholarships. But 4,000 scholarships over four years, to me, seems quite a token effort. Many of the indigenous support groups and communities have acknowledged that very few Aboriginal  or islander people will have a shot at one of these scholarships. I believe it is rumoured that an Aboriginal or islander person will have a one&hyphen;in&hyphen;4,000 chance of getting into an institution like Sydney University on one of those scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also notes that indigenous Australian students have consistently raised the need for acknowledgment of all the financial pressures and constraints in sustaining involvement in higher education. These include the significant costs involved with child care, for example, transport costs, and other costs that you perhaps would not normally associate with involvement in the education sector. This report clearly indicates that the impact of other funding and fee charging arrangements must be examined when we are determining or examining participation rates of indigenous people in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend that particular recommendation. It is No. 15 in this report, and it states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2932">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Higher Education Council be asked to monitor the impact on Indigenous Australian students of changes in financial arrangements and higher education policy and to report, in the context of its broad equity brief, on the impact of these on recruitment, retention and success of Indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a report that I commend to the Senate, and it is a recommendation which I heartily support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the time, I obviously will need to restrict my remarks on this report: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Review of Institutional Use of Commonwealth Higher Education Funding for Indigenous Australian Students</EMPHASIS> . I have had a look at this report very briefly, and I note the essential recommendations that Senator Stott Despoja has drawn attention to&mdash;in particular, the inadequacies of the present arrangements for the monitoring of participation by Aboriginal students and students from a Torres Strait Islander background in Australian higher education institutions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is quite apparent is that the measures taken in recent years to see that funding is rolled into the general operating grants of universities has had a detrimental effect, as I read this report, on the amounts or effective distribution of those moneys for specific Aboriginal educational purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a general trend operating within education, I think, which needs to be examined more closely. In this regard, the Higher Education Council's report does us a service in drawing attention to this whole concept of broadbanding, which is becoming all too prevalent in education. That is where this Commonwealth allocates, or at least has allocated in the past, moneys for specific purposes. But increasingly we find that they are being rolled into other purposes, and that the level of accountability is therefore reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is therefore an issue that I do think we ought be taking up more forcefully. What this council report also indicates&mdash;and it does show, I think, quite forcefully on page 37 of the report&mdash;is that the council was aware of the many great difficulties which are faced by persons from indigenous backgrounds who are attempting to be successful
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the higher education sector. Of course, it draws attention, as I say, to the issues of the manner in which funding is directed to that particular purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it also highlights, however, is the fact that the problems faced by persons of Aboriginal background go much broader than can be examined purely in an educational context. What this report suggests is that there ought be greater priority in terms of public debate, and greater encouragement given to examination of participation and retention of persons of indigenous background and, in particular, the capacity of particular institutions to provide the strategic plans necessary to ensure the success of all Australians in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a further area of difficulty in terms of the profile processes that are undertaken within the university system in this country where, I think, it is all too often the case that there is just not sufficient detail provided by universities as to the specific measures they are taking to enhance the objective of ensuring greater participation&mdash;and success&mdash;of persons from an indigenous background in the higher education sector. It is in this broad context that the equity provisions or equity implications this involves, to me, warrant much closer examination by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other more general issue I would draw attention to is that this government is moving to abolish the National Board of Education Employment and Training. This is the measure that this government is undertaking. While it wishes to maintain the Higher Education Council specifically, it will be seeking to abolish all the other councils that make up NBEET.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a particularly serious matter, because the very issues that go to questions of the cross&hyphen;sectoral relationship&mdash;that is, the interrelationship between the various sectors&mdash;of education are very important. And there is no device within the education system to provide impartial, objective advice to government and to this parliament on the effectiveness of government programs across the sectors within education. This report highlights just how important that advice really is. It is in that context I think this report has also done
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2933"> us a favour. In having remarked on that matter, I move that this debate be adjourned, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

Let us hope, Senator, that there is not a significant increase in that drop&hyphen;off you have had reported to you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just make the point that we believe it is important for the parliament and the Senate, where it is possible, to clear up differing interpretations about the actuarial guidelines. There is a great deal of concern about this issue amongst people in defined benefit funds because unfortunately my experience with actuaries on this particular issue is that you get a different answer from different actuaries. No more compelling case have we seen of that in recent times than the information which has been circulating in this parliament. It certainly is a serious problem&mdash;different actuaries giving different advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not being critical of the actuary profession, although I do not pretend to understand it. It is a very intensive and long-term academic study.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been our experience that differing advice is being given by different actuaries. That has led to a great deal of concern by members of various defined benefit funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read into the record some advice that I have received in relation to the complaints tribunal. The advice is that a trustee who merely reports surchargeable contributions to the ATO as advised by the fund actuary acting in accordance with actuarial practice is following the act. On the other hand, the trustee's decision on the reduction of benefits is not prescribed by the legislation in this area. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal would have greater jurisdiction.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There again I know there would be a lot of very worried people. When you indicate that this legislation will have the effect of reducing people's benefits, obviously there is a great deal of concern because we are reducing the benefit of retirement incomes for a significant number of people. Those people when they entered the fund had an expectation of receiving X amount, whatever it may have been, in whatever fund it is. The effect of the surcharge is to reduce their benefit because of the application of the new tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I know the government argues it is fair in respect of people earning more than $70,000 that they should have their benefit reduced because of the application of the new tax&mdash;and we can accept the overall principle&mdash;I just wonder is it fair when people have entered into a contractual agreement with an employer, become a member of a superannuation fund, with an expectation that they are entitled to X amount when they retire and their benefit is reduced part way through their employment by a new government tax? I think to that extent it lacks fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the concerns of the significant number of people in defined benefit funds who have expressed that concern to the Labor opposition. Nevertheless, despite the other adverse consequences that we have been dealing with in this legislation since budget night, the government is intent on increasing the effective tax rate for these people in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> defined benefit funds and cutting their retirement income. That does have an element of unfairness as part of the overall fairness the government has continued to assert on taxing high income earners. We will deal with that in a little more detail when we get to Senator Harradine's amendment a little later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe where we can we should try to deal with some of these definitional issues&mdash;and vesting is an important issue&mdash;and, in principle, Labor believes that the Senate where it is possible should attempt to amend the legislation. We cannot accept the approach of the Australian Democrats, for example, that they recognise it as a problem but it is not up to us to try and resolve it. I think that is why we are here. If we think there is a problem it is not enough just to say, `Let all the consequences flow. Let them fall and it is all on your head, Senator Kemp.' I do not mind it being on your head but I think we have an obligation as senators to try to correct or at least reduce the massive tonnage that will end up on your head in some ways by trying to minimise the problems you are going to encounter when these bills go through this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can accept some of what you say, Senator, but it is not we who are proposing the new tax. It is not we who gave that commitment at the election not to increase existing taxes, particularly on superannuation. In fact, our principled approach to superannuation is to build superannuation for the future, but we will, I am sure, have a lot more to say about that next week as a consequence of other measures. If there was not a new tax, we would not have the problem.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We believe this is an important amendment. The government has said it is a 15 per cent tax on superannuation for people earning more than $70,000, that no more than that should apply and that this 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions contained in defined benefit funds is to be calculated by using a notional surcharge contribution factor. This factor is supposed to determine the level of employer contributions that were notionally contributed to the individual's superannuation accounts. When this notional surcharge contribution factor is applied, it determines what level of 15 per cent tax is to apply that year to the member's benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very important. Depending on the way in which the scheme is established, it may be possible for members in defined benefit funds to pay in excess of the 15 per cent tax. We have had submissions and concerns raised about this&mdash;and I am sure every senator in this chamber is well aware of those concerns. This amendment ensures that where a debit account has been established alongside the superannuation account, which will pay out when the benefit is paid, the member pays no more than 15 per cent surcharge on the final value of the member's benefit and that interest accrued is also paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the point of defined benefit funds, I note that&mdash;I think it was yesterday, Senator Kemp&mdash;the government issued another press statement indicating that amendments would have to be moved for the trustee to be able to reduce the member's benefit to pay the 15 per cent tax. This will be the fourth set of amendments that the government has had to introduce to these bills in addition to the two new bills that were introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really a major example of the government making policy on the run. Just yesterday we got another press release saying that there are going to be further amendments
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in order for the trustee to be able to reduce the member's benefit to pay the 15 per cent tax. I might say in passing that this is an issue I attempted to ask Senator Kemp about in question time which resulted from the problems that have arisen due to the view of Dennis Rose about the legality of clause 34 on what the government was going to do about attempting to quietly admit that there were problems&mdash;and ongoing consequential problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does concern us very greatly that we get yet more notification, another press statement, with more amendments that have to be moved to the SIS Act. Where are these amendments? It would be useful to have them when considering this legislation. I notice that Senator Kemp does give us slight criticism occasionally about the complexity of our amendments and the technicalities involved, but I think the government's problems surrounding the imposition of this new tax are very substantial indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise, in closing my contribution, that if the government says that no&hyphen;one is to pay more than 15 per cent tax, then accept our amendment. There should not be any problem, Senator Kemp, in your accepting that concept and the amendment. No&hyphen;one should pay more than 15 per cent. We are advised that in certain defined benefit funds it is potentially possible for a person to pay more than 15 per cent, and we want to assure those people that 15 per cent is the upper limit. It is consistent with government policy.  We hope for the support of the chamber on this very fundamental, very important and very simple principle that should be in the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I might remind him of what I put forward in respect of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme where the employer does not make contributions during the life of the scheme but pays a defined benefit, usually a pension, on the retirement of the employee. This legislation that we are dealing with requires that a notional employer contribution is actuarially assessed each year in order to calculate the amount of the surcharge owing for that year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is right. The surcharge amounts assessed each year accumulate until the member retires or leaves the fund. Interest is charged on the accumulating amount each year at the 10&hyphen;year Treasurer bond rate, which is currently almost eight per cent. That is, the interest compounds annually. The final amount owing is paid by commuting the pension otherwise payable, deducting the amount owing and then recommuting the remainder into a reduced pension. I ask the minister directly through you, Madam Temporary Chairman: is it not a fact that the net result of those requirements is that after the first year the effective surcharge rate will be more than 15 per cent because of the effect of interest charged on the amount, and the total owing will increase rapidly because of the compounding effect of the interest charges? I ask the minister: is that not the net effect of the bill that is currently before us in respect of that defined benefit scheme?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, this is a serious point and I want to tell you how the government is addressing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2941"> this issue. For reasons that I will state, we do not like your amendment. In some ways it will not address the issue which it seeks to address. Again, superannuation and tax law generally are complex issues and careful drafting is always required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government Actuary is here. He has provided me with important advice on this issue, which I think should give comfort to the Senate. The Government Actuary advises that a deduction exceeding 15 per cent of the value of the final benefit is unlikely to arise, and there are two reasons why. The notional surcharge rate will take account of benefit entitlements as they accrue, and in the unlikely event that the debit account exceeds 15 per cent, it would be a notifiable event and the actuary would make an adjustment. I will repeat that: in the unlikely event that the debit account exceeds 15 per cent, it would be a notifiable event and the actuary would make the required adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendment is more blunt as it has to cover all schemes. An actuary can tailor the events to put the scheme delivering greater equity. Labor's amendment that you have put forward would not, for example, cover private defined benefit schemes. I want to give the Senate that assurance that, if there was an occasion where the debit account exceeded 15 per cent, it would be a notifiable event and the actuary would make the required adjustment. That indicates that we recognise the issue and have provided the assurances that people are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has also raised a similar issue, but he has looked at the use of the 10&hyphen;year interest rate which is designed to ensure equity between different types of funds. We had this debate earlier on this bill. I think Senator Harradine may be assuming that the notional contribution rate is the same for every member of the fund. The Government Actuary has advised us that the notional surcharge contribution rate will take account of assumed in effect notional contribution interest and the level of benefits accruing to members each year. According to the Government Actuary, this would imply that the situation raised by Senator Harradine is based
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on incorrect assumptions. Interest is charged so that the members of defined benefit schemes do not receive an advantage over members of accumulation schemes caused by the deferral of payment of the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an accumulation scheme, the surcharge is payable each year for high income earners; in unfunded defined benefit schemes they do not have to pay that each year&mdash;the interest is paid at the end of the process, not on an annual basis. In setting the notional surcharge contribution rate, this interest would be incorporated. So we are trying to ensure equity between different types of schemes. Whatever one may think of the method that we have chosen to collect the surcharge&mdash;and we think it is the most efficient of the available options&mdash;any option, in order to ensure proper equity, would have to address the difference between an accumulation fund and an unfunded defined benefit scheme. In order to ensure such fairness, I believe that any process would have to be the same.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Madam Chair, and thank you, Senator Margetts. On the point that the Minister, Senator Kemp, mentioned, that is precisely the problem. The problem in the defined benefits scheme, the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, is that there is no option that the payment be made on an annual basis. Therefore, as I indicated and placed on the record last night, the total amount owing will increase rapidly because of the compounding effect of the interest charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2942">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave the example last night&mdash;and it is incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that a public servant with 15 years service would pay half as much again in interest charges than he would if he was able to arrange for the surcharge amount to be paid annually as it fell due. You talk about discrimination: isn't that discrimination? With respect, Assistant Treasurer, through you, Madam Chair, I would seriously ask the government to examine what I put forward last night. I do not want to canvass it again&mdash;we have not got the time to do it tonight&mdash;but I really would like to see a detailed response to the matters that I raised last night.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is really another situation very akin to the situation we saw with the family tax package, where the government mucked around with the area of taxation so that they could claim that a $200 benefit was actually a $1,000 benefit. In fact, it is basically claiming that a 15 per cent tax is just an income based surcharge and does not count. We have the poor old tax office slugged with another complexity. I hope that is also added in to what the Assistant Treasurer was saying about adding resources. I just wonder how many more resources you can give the tax office every time you try to twist around legislation to make it look like something else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case the lack of clarity is likely to have a negative impact on all those in undefined benefit schemes such as the Commonwealth and state superannuation schemes, because benefits are not funded, as has been mentioned&mdash;that is, no contributions are actually made, so the liability is deferred. Because the benefits are only calculated at the end of employment, suddenly the entire liability becomes due at once. This raises a number of problems for the government's superannuation tax scheme. If contributions are taken to be made over a period of years, they want interest on the deferred liability, even though employees have no option of paying, as Senator Harradine mentioned, because the liability is undefined. So it has not been defined what they are going to get so they cannot pay.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the contributions are taken as being made on termination, employees' notional income for that year is huge, pushing them into the highest tax brackets and making them liable to what is then a punitive superannuation tax, even though their income may have been modest during their working life. In either case it is inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the Assistant Treasurer said it would be a notifiable event. I can only wonder how many big brothers there will be looking over everybody's account. Who will be notifying whom? What will be the outcome when somebody notifies somebody else? Who is going to be responsible? Is it going to be the individual's responsibility to notify? Will the tax department notify? In these days of self-assessment, who is actually going to be the one notifying? Who is going to be the one watching out to see that everybody is treated fairly? I just cannot see it myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Actuary would make an adjustment, just like magic. I think the capping would be a much better idea. We are all admitting that what we are trying to do is make a bit more of a sensible hash of what is a totally bad lot. It would have been much better for the government to take the package back and redo it rather than have us on the floor here trying to make less of a hash of what is a total mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP wishes to ensure that at least those working in the Public Service, or members of similar schemes, regardless of notional interest and so on, will not be hit with more than a 15 per cent tax. I would like to believe that there will be an invisible hand  watching over everybody so that nobody is slugged, but I know myself that it is complex to work out what your liabilities are as an individual. I even know that it is difficult for one's tax accountant to know exactly when you may have been charged extra. I really would like the minister to be able to say how this invisible hand will work and how the public can be assured that they will not be charged excessive amounts and then have a great deal of difficulty working out or proving later on that they have been charged too much.</PARA>

Of course, we contend that one of the problems the government faces is that, if this tax does not apply across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board, it will make a mockery of this package of bills, and we have already discussed this to some extent. We believe it is ridiculous that we are considering legislation without state agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has this particular problem because of the constitution. It cannot apply this set of legislation to state constitutionally protected funds. We believe there are broader constitutional problems. I am certainly not a lawyer, but the broader constitutional problems were touched on last week&mdash;Senator Watson was there&mdash;when a serving Federal Court judge, Justice Evans, expressed some concern about the constitutional aspects of this legislation. We believe that, if New South Wales did pass the legislation and none of the other states did, this would have very serious implications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with Labor amendment 25, which is the ability to make provisional payments. I understand that many people in the Public Service would like payments not to be deferred. While payments cannot be made with certainty of final liability, as we explained earlier there is an ability to create a notional contribution, therefore a notional liability, along the lines of a PAYE tax payment. Such a notional liability could be collected and then it would require only an adjustment when the actual liability comes due, without prejudice or accrued interest since it is not possible to make the payment before the actual liability is known. At least the option for such a plan should be offered. It also seems a preferential option in terms of government revenue, since it would mean that money would come to Treasury immediately instead of in future years. Therefore, and as people would probably realise, the Greens will support this measure.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the chamber has amendments from Senator Allison relating to amendments Nos 6 and 8. We will need some time to go through this. I have not had an opportunity to read it yet and I do not want to go back to it straight away, because it is five pages long. It is quite complex and difficult and we have to get some advice about the effect of it. I request that we come back to it later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to our amendment No. 27. We oppose clause 18, the tax file number issue. The government announced on 20 August last year a measure that it argued was designed to introduce greater equity into superannuation. It certainly was not apparent, when the government announced on 20 August the so-called surcharge, that it was introducing a tax on people who failed to provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand superannuation funds are not regulated by privacy laws and, indeed, the government recently announced that there
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be no extension of privacy laws to private entities. Yet the government expects and in fact penalises harshly&mdash;it is an interesting principle&mdash;individuals who fail to provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund. It certainly was not envisaged&mdash;I can recall the debate on tax file numbers and I can certainly recall some of the warnings Senator Harradine gave at the time&mdash;that, if you did not provide your tax file number, you would have to cop a 15 per cent tax. Senator Harradine, I do not think even you thought it would be quite that serious if you did not provide your tax file number. But I have to say it is reflecting on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last few months some of the warnings that were made at the time have proved correct. As I say, no&hyphen;one would have believed that a 15 per cent tax would be applied to people who did not provide their tax file number. This is very significant. It has not had a lot of debate or coverage. Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine have raised it in the context of this issue. This is a very significant privacy issue in this country. I think it is somewhat ironic that, although this government is a self&hyphen;proclaimed protector of individuals and believes that the individual is paramount, as reflected in its broad philosophical position on so many aspects of its attitude to government, and although we have continually heard the notion of choice being used in the debate surrounding this issue, the RSA issue and other legislation before the parliament, you have a right to choose and that right is fine as long as if you exercise that right as an individual and do not provide the tax file number you pay a 15 per cent tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an extraordinary set of parameters around the issue of the choice of an individual. Labor finds this concept and outcome in the application of the tax in this set of legislation to be outrageous. Senator Kemp has said that individuals who have a conscientious objection to providing their tax file number to their superannuation fund can contact the tax office and request the tax office to contact the fund. That is a ludicrous procedure, Senator Kemp. If it were implemented by any sizeable number of people, you would have a line a mile long outside the tax offices in Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2950"> It is an abhorrent principle if it is applied in that way. The entire industry has made contact with Labor and highlighted this particular problem with implementation because of the very complex and indirect way in which the government has attempted to collect this extra $&half; billion a year in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to heighten emotions at this late stage of the night&mdash;we are making reasonable progress on the legislation&mdash;but regrettably we have come to the conclusion that the Treasurer has been incredibly arrogant. He does know the effect of the non&hyphen;provision of tax file numbers by individuals. The Treasurer has been arrogant and even bloody&hyphen;minded.

I notice my colleague Senator Cooney is outraged by the principles behind this particular approach. Is it fair? The Prime Minister keeps saying that this is a fair measure. The fairness of all of this is: if you do not provide your tax file number you are taxed at 15 per cent. The Prime Minister has a fascinating new approach to fairness in this country, particularly when there were other options. Senator Kemp is well aware of those. I will not extend the debate by going into the reasons why the government refused to consider the other options. We have canvassed that already in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

It might make the bill unworkable in relation to tax file numbers&mdash;and maybe that is a good idea&mdash;but it might also backfire and affect only those large numbers of people who did not quote their tax file number, and who now will not have a mechanism to get the money back.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of matters which have been raised&mdash;and I will come back to your questions, Senator Cooney. I want to respond, firstly, to the earlier comment by Senator Sherry that the Tax Pack should have a note which tells taxpayers how important it is to quote a TFN to their superannuation funds. There will be a note in the Tax Pack, and notices of assessment which will follow lodgment of tax returns this year will also prompt taxpayers in regard to TFN quotation. They are just two examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your histrionics, Senator Sherry, about the use of the tax file number and the distinction you tried to make between bank accounts&mdash;when your government required a TFN to be lodged with a bank&mdash;and this particular measure does not wash. The purpose of the banks requiring tax file numbers for accounts was to ensure the proper collection of a tax, and this TFN assists in the proper collection of a surcharge&mdash;or, in that case, will actually ensure that a surcharge for low and middle income earners will not be imposed. For you to carry on with your histrionics about this does not wash one iota with me, Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of privacy, Senator Cooney, I return the compliment: you have been a great supporter of civil rights. I am not too sure
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2953"> how far out in front you were on the Australia card, but I do not think we have to revisit that issue. In general, the principle that I have stated is quite correct, and the tax file numbers should only be used in the proper circumstances. The whole issue of privacy in this matter was, I am advised, extensively discussed before Senator Watson's committee. The Privacy Commissioner gave evidence to that committee and I think that evidence and advice that she gave is publicly available. You were quite right to draw that to our attention, Senator Cooney, and it has been extensively canvassed.</PARA></SPEECH>

But it needs to be seen in light of the amendment we are moving to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill and, in fact, the two amendments need to be considered together. So, if this motion was carried, then the amendment to the imposition bill would need to be carried. It would obviously be a ridiculous position if this amendment was carried and the further amendment which we will come to later was defeated. I hope we will not be in that position, but that would take care of the problem that you have identified.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 46 goes to the issue of actuarial guidelines. I am not going to speak for very long on this issue because we have discussed the particular problems with actuarial guidelines as they apply, and we have yet to see the actuarial guidelines. They are to be published in a month. That is very unsatisfactory for people who are inquiring as to how they will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment seeks to ensure that the actuarial standard, which is to be used to determine the notional surcharge contributions factor, is a disallowable instrument in both houses of parliament. Given that this standard will have to be reviewed, it is entirely appropriate that the houses of parliament are able to disallow the standard should it breach the actual intention of the 15 per cent tax on superannuation. We do not believe that it is excessive or unreasonable for the parliament to have a say in the actuarial guidelines. We believe that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the actuarial standard will not be presented to us for another month, according to the advice given to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, for example, it is entirely appropriate for the Senate to decide that the actuarial guidelines should be subject to parliamentary review in order to ensure that the standards are in keeping with the intention of the government's policy. Quite simply, we do not accept all the assurances given by the government in respect of this package of legislation, so why should we accept their assurances in respect of actuarial guidelines?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are now a few more senators than we have had in this chamber so far tonight, I might say that the actuarial guidelines are very important. For example, there is conflicting advice about the possibility of the tax effectively being more than 15 per
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent on a number of defined benefit funds, and colleagues in here may find that of some interest. We believe that these actuarial guidelines should be subject to parliamentary review in order to ensure that the standards the government continually asserts are in keeping with the intention of the government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are sceptical&mdash;we have a right to be sceptical&mdash;about the government's stated policy on the package of bills. There have been a number of significant changes, for a number of reasons, in respect of the package of legislation that has been before us over the last few months. The hour is late so I am not going to go in the detail of why that has occurred. We have already traversed that in this debate.

Actuarial standards are binding on all practising actuaries in Australia. The safeguards in this approach include the manner in which these guidelines are developed, which involves consultation on all issues with superannuation actuaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To collect a tax, which is, as I said before, a fundamental function of parliament, just seems to be extraordinary. If we gave over, as they did in biblical times, the collection of taxation to private enterprise, does that mean to say that we would not be able to set up any standards? To say that we can control and properly make regulations about the taxation department&mdash;or any other government department&mdash;but not about a private group which that taxation department is going to rely on to determine how much money would be gathered in, just seems to me to be absolutely extraordinary. To come in here and say that parliament cannot look at what actuaries do and, if they find something, disallow it, seems extraordinary, particularly when we can disallow in this chamber rules of court. To think that we can disallow the rules of the High Court of Australia or the rules of the Federal Court of Australia but not disallow some rules made by a private group&mdash;namely, a group of actuaries&mdash;just seems to me a most extraordinary thing.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

In the last couple of weeks we have just heard about the federal government's intention to privatise data processing in a whole range of departments.

If you are actually getting private enterprise, which a lot of people do not think is a good idea, to collect tax and then say, `We can't regulate them', for heaven's sake, what is this coming to and what is the thick end of the wedge? What are we going to be seeing?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the way we should be going. The very warning bells that are ringing now would probably indicate that we have to start looking at what is happening under the competition policy bill that went through in 1995. We should start looking at major amendments to that before we get anywhere near the thick end of the wedge that I can see looming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree with Senator Cooney that it is a ridiculous assumption to stand there, as we are pushing more and more for private enterprise to take over the roles of government&mdash;in this case, to take over tax collection&mdash;and say, `No, we are not able as a parliament to oversee or regulate how that is done.'

Before I speak to the amendment, I want to note that we received the Democrat-government amendment on the exemption of low and middle income earners from the collection of the new 15 per cent tax where a tax file number has not been provided. There was some formatting problem that Senator Allison has explained to me. We regret that we received the corrected, formatted amendment only in the last 10 or 15 minutes. It is 24 hours after the government and the Democrats reached agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complex issue. I am not having a go at Senator Kemp. I just want it noted clearly for the record that we have been waiting on this government-Democrat amendment for the past 24 hours. It is very important; it is difficult; it is complex. We understand and appreciate the difficulty that the Democrats and the government had in finalising the wording of this very important amendment, but I will make some comments on that shortly. In the very brief time we have had a chance to have a look at it, we have found that it is quite extensive and very complex. We will make some comments on that shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment 51 is very important. Is the committee tonight dealing with a surcharge or a tax? We have to recall the words of the Liberal Party manifesto prior to the last election: no increases in existing taxes, no new taxes. On budget night in August last
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2958"> year, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced a massive new revenue raising measure worth an average of $1.5 billion over three years. At the same time, he said he would not be increasing taxes. This is the government's largest single revenue raising measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise that it is not our fault that we are dealing with the government's largest single revenue raising measure six days before the following year's budget. This legislation was presented to the parliament&mdash;I forget the particular date&mdash;in February, and the government has presented some significant amendments and a readjustment of its position, particularly in respect to the legal criticisms from Mr Rose representing the Business Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the government forgot to include federal public servants in its initial package of legislation. I suppose it is fairly understandable that these major elements of tax policy and tax legislation would be omitted because of the general chaos that surrounded the preparation and presentation of this legislation. We were left with the regrettable situation of being presented with these bills prior to the Easter adjournment at 10 o'clock&mdash;two hours before the midnight cut&hyphen;off for the Senate to conclude its deliberations. That was squarely in the government's court; it presented that legislation two hours before the cut-off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very complex legislation. I handled the industrial relations bills in the chamber. I think we spent some two weeks on that legislation last year. Whilst this legislation has been less exhaustive in that much less time has been spent, the technical detail is considerable. If you compare it to the industrial relations package, it is much more complex, particularly given the various aspects of tax legislation that one has to have knowledge of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it a tax or is it a surcharge? If we look at the budget papers presented last year by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, it is described in those budget papers as a tax. When we asked for an explanation from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, he said it was a typographical error that it was described as a tax. The real reason the government will not acknowledge that this is a tax&mdash;even though it is a half a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion dollar a year revenue raising measure&mdash;is that it did not want to be seen to be breaking its specific election commitment: no new taxes, no increase in existing taxes.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a very important principle that the Senate ensure that the government is required to acknowledge that this is a tax; that there is a fundamental breach of the election commitment given at the last election that there would be no increase in taxes and no new taxes. The government in imposing this new tax&mdash;it calls it a surcharge&mdash;does rely on the taxation powers of the Commonwealth in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the government called it a surcharge? In addition to the Prime Minister wanting to avoid being accused of breaking an election commitment, it went one step further than calling it a surcharge and required the superannuation funds to collect the so-called surcharge themselves. The government had a hope&mdash;and I think a vain hope&mdash;that, by requiring the superannuation funds to collect a new tax, it would not be as noticeable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the people in the industry who have spoken first-hand to the Treasurer about this matter believe that that is the base cynical
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2959"> approach of the very arrogant Treasurer on this matter. Some would believe the Prime Minister is not capable of cynicism. Indeed, he did ask us to call a spade a spade. I would certainly believe the Prime Minister should have called a tax a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government called it a surcharge to make sure that it could not be accused of breaking an election promise and it also tried to hide the charge by getting the superannuation funds to collect it in the vain hope that people would not notice it. But when fund members receive their statements over the next six months or year, they will see that there is an existing superannuation tax of 15 per cent&mdash;surprise, surprise! I do not think it is just coincidence that the existing tax on superannuation is 15 per cent. The government struck a rate of 15 per cent surcharge in addition to the existing 15 per cent tax.</PARA>

It is estimated to cost&mdash;and I will not take the more alarmist position of the industry&mdash;between $20 million and $100 million to collect this new tax. That will be detailed on fund statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to note Senator Heffernan is taking some interest in this debate because I think, once this package of legislation is passed and once the complaints start to flow,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he will take a lot of interest in the consequences of the imposition of this new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the statements in the next year there will be the 15 per cent existing tax, the 15 per cent new tax called a surcharge by the government, the advanced instalment of 7&half; per cent&mdash;that is 37&half; per cent so far&mdash;minus administrative costs and in some cases additional administrative costs for the collection of the new tax. Unfortunately, I do not think many Australian people are aware that the money in that year will effectively be taxed another 15 per cent when they leave the fund&mdash;a grand total of 52&half; per cent tax in the first year of operation of the surcharge. It is no wonder that there is a significant amount of angst, concern and anger in the Australian community about this package of measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This surcharge is supposed to apply to high income earners. We have exhaustively covered why it is going to apply to low and middle income earners. I do not believe that higher income earners in their wildest dreams believed when they voted for this government that their superannuation would effectively be hit with 52&half; per cent tax plus the increased administrative costs in the first year after the election of the new government which promised them lower taxes. The government has maintained that it is a fair measure to apply this new tax in the way it has outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has gone to considerable efforts, as I have said, to avoid using the word `tax' in this debate. It has been grossly untruthful during the debate and over the past five months in this regard. The new tax has been met with considerable anger, which has been magnified by it continually being referred to&mdash;by Mr Howard, in particular&mdash;as a `surcharge'. People do not like to be kidded when a new tax is being applied, particularly when commitments were given at the election that no new taxes would be applied. They do not like being treated as fools by the Prime Minister with his continuingly misleading statements that this is a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claims being made that there were no new taxes in the last budget are clearly ridiculous&mdash;and this is the worst example. As I said earlier, it is the largest single revenue raising measure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2960">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer was questioned on the John Laws program about the issue of Dennis Rose QC's remarks before the Senate select committee&mdash;and Dennis Rose himself said, `It is plainly a tax.' In fact, Justice Davies, who is a sitting Federal Court judge, last week also called it a tax; that was his view. On the John Laws program, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax that is being collected on employer contributions will be 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was acknowledging that it was a tax. Also, on the National Radio breakfast program with Pru Goward, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So this is nothing new that we're introducing in the sense of the contributions tax. It's been operating for quite some time. What we're doing is we're changing the rate in relation to high income earners from 15 per cent to 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a tax. The committee should pass this amendment and the following amendments to indicate clearly to the Australian people that the Treasurer has accepted it is a tax, everyone else says it is a tax, we believe it is a tax, it should be called a tax&mdash;and, hopefully, the last person in Australia who does not believe it is a tax, Mr Howard, will finally be convinced it is not a surcharge.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I call this amendment `calling a spade a spade', and that seems to be the kind of terminology the Prime Minister is using too. This amendment, as has been mentioned, changes the word `surcharge' to `tax'. We fully support the amendment on the basis of truth: it is a tax. Moreover, it is specifically an income tax, or at least that is its announced intention. Its intention is based on total income&mdash;not on the level of superannuation contribution, not on whether the superannuation is a salary sacrifice for tax evasion purposes, and not on whether it is a rort or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why the government might want to make out that this is not a tax. It has made promises not to raise taxes; it is already fudging it by saying `no new taxes'; but it did not say that it would not raise the same old taxes. It is hard trying to weasel out of acknowledging what it is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many government promises, however, should not be kept. I have to say that many
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are awful&mdash;or plainly stupid. I for one do not think I should hold governments to stupid promises. I would rather that they were repentant, honestly repentant, and stopped targeting the weak and poor, stopped targeting marginal people like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and stopped targeting students and the old and the sick. Those are the kinds of promises that I think should not be kept because they should never have made them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would rather that government realise they cannot provide services for the community while reducing the tax base&mdash;and as Mr Costello has indicated, he might go even further in this next budget&mdash;and eliminating any obligations for business to include such things as equity and human consideration because it adds to the cost of compliance, for instance. I would much rather see government become repentant than keep it honestly horrible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment and several subsequent amendments seek to change the word `surcharge' to `tax'. I do not think we should ask government to stick to negative promises and I would prefer repentant fibbers to barefaced fibbers. But that does not mean that we should allow them to become deceitful. This is a tax and it should be so called.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will support these amendments. The changes, we believe, are important and, even though we have been unable to get the government to agree that they are important, we are happy to support the ALP in this regard. We think that, whilst we have reached agreement with the government on excluding redundancy benefits from the definition of `income' and exempting low income earners from paying the surcharge, it is still very important to insist that the government concede that this $1.5 billion tax is in fact a tax.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We think it is entirely appropriate that the Senate say to the government in the House of Representatives, `If you want this bill, accept that it is a tax and get on with it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be quite dishonest for parliament to let the government get away with pretending that this tax is not a tax simply because the government chooses to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2961"> call it a surcharge. Indeed, I suspect that half of the problem for the government in designing the collection mechanism was to try to build a whole complicated edifice to deny that the surcharge is a tax. If the government had admitted it was a tax up-front and collected it through the normal PAYE system, then none of the problems that have been identified by the Senate super committee&mdash;and, I have to say, by the industry&mdash;would have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that this surcharge is a tax. Indeed, this is a point acknowledged by the tax officials in their evidence to the super committee when they said that the surcharge relies on the taxation power of the constitution. If it is not a tax, it is not constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996-97 budget papers clearly recognised it as a tax as the largest single revenue measure. Indeed, the proceeds from the surcharge have been added into income tax collections. It has been pointed out that a key factor in the nine per cent increase in income tax collections this year and the 7.6 per cent increase next year was the `increase in superannuation contributions tax for higher income earners'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tax, Senator Kemp, so why not call it a tax? Why all the subterfuge and the elaborate avoidance of the issue?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to you on your appointment as Deputy President and wish you all the very best for the future. I thank the Senate for this opportunity to say a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> few words on what is my last occasion in this chamber. Next week I leave for London to take up my new position as the Australian member of the executive board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In many respects, I am returning to the area of professional interest that I pursued before first entering federal parliament in 1975. I welcome the opportunity to move to this next stage in my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, of course, is the second time that I have left parliament. The circumstances are very different. The first occasion, in October 1980, was involuntary on my part when the voters of Ballarat fell half a per cent short of returning Short to Canberra after five years as their representative. That involuntary departure also proved to be temporary as I returned to parliament, but this time in the Senate, in the election of 1984. This time I am leaving totally voluntarily and, I can assure you, totally permanently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is the end of a long political road that began in 1975. My association with the parliament actually predates that by almost a dozen years because in 1964 I came to Parliament House for a near two&hyphen;year stint as private secretary to the then Treasurer, Harold Holt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political road has been one of highs and lows, from being part of Malcolm Fraser's new team in 1975; to the defeat in Ballarat in 1980; to election to the Senate in 1984; to the frontbench in 1987; to the backbench in 1988, as a victim of the so&hyphen;called rotisserie reshuffle of the then opposition leader, John Howard; to the shadow finance portfolio in 1990 and a heavy involvement in the development of Fightback; to coalition deputy Senate leader in 1992; to the despair of the election loss in 1993; to three rewarding years as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs; to the high of Assistant Treasurer in the first Howard government; to the disappointment of resignation just seven months later because of my belief in the Westminster principles despite the fact that, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, at no stage had I acted with any impropriety whatsoever. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2962">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, after spending most of the past decade on the coalition frontbench, I think my decision to move on to what will be an exciting and challenging new stage of my life is the right decision at the right time. In my decision to leave I draw support from Ecclesiastes 3:1, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I leave with certain regrets but many happy memories. I have enjoyed virtually all the issues with which I have been involved as a member of the federal parliament in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. If I were to single out what I would regard as my most significant personal involvements over my more than 17 years in this parliament, I think I would list five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first was my role in initiating and pursuing in the parliament consideration of what became known as the Dollar Sweets and Troubleshooters cases in the mid&hyphen;1980s. Those cases ultimately had a quite profound impact, eventually for the better, on the industrial relations climate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second was the opportunity to be part of the small team that did much of the detailed work in putting together the most comprehensive program for reform that has ever been presented to the Australian people. It is one of the truly great tragedies of Australian history that we were unable, in 1993, to explain sufficiently clearly to the people just what huge benefits the Fightback program conferred on our prospects both as individuals and as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third highlight was as Assistant Treasurer in playing what the Prime Minister described as a major role in the preparation of the first budget of the first Howard government in 1996. That budget did much to put our national public finances back on track and to lay the foundations for a sustainable better future for all Australians. And I have every confidence that next week's budget will build on the foundations laid last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are two other areas of my political involvement from which I gain most satisfaction. The first is my involvement right from the start in that initial group of people both inside and outside the parliament who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pushed for the removal of the barriers to economic growth that were so severely hampering the ability of Australians to achieve their individual and national potential. We were known initially as the economic dries and later as economic rationalists. Both terms are essentially pejorative and meaningless. Their use I think displays a lack of understanding of what greater economic freedom and competition can do to provide jobs, improve living standards and produce a fairer and better society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, despite the pejorative labels, the advocates of that agenda won the philosophical, political and policy debate in the marketplace of ideas in the 1980s and, as a result, the future of Australia is much more positive and exciting. However, there is still much reform that needs to occur. The directions already set must be maintained and pursued, including the pressing need for a comprehensive review and overhaul of our taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area, and the one that I derived the greatest personal satisfaction from, is the wonderful privilege I have had both before and throughout virtually all my political career, including in particular my three years as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, of meeting and working with Australians whose origins reflect the richly diverse, harmonious, tolerant, multicultural nation that is the Australia of the late 1990s and the envy of almost every other nation on Earth. I want to say to all Australians whose ethnic or racial origins are the 150 or more nations from which immigrants have built the Australia of today that collectively we have much to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank the huge number of Australians of widely varying ethnic, racial and religious origins whom I have had the enormous pleasure and privilege of getting to know, many of whom I can genuinely call friend. Overwhelmingly these people are fiercely proud to be Australian&mdash;to give a total commitment to Australia, to share common values with other Australians and to join in shaping the exciting, evolving Australia of the late 20th century. It is the very diversity of the contributions that each of us
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2963"> brings to our society that has helped Australia throughout our history to forge a unique, cohesive and above all united nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have expected that it is self-evident that we are a nation blessed by this richness of cultural and ethnic origins and the very special qualities it has produced. But it is clear that that is not the case. We cannot ignore that people like Pauline Hanson&mdash;with narrow, prejudiced, negative, distorted, divisive, insular views, widely inaccurate facts and a lack of any acceptable rational policy proposals&mdash;have a certain following in Australia today. If that following were to grow, it would impose a very real threat to the stability and fabric of our society and to our role in the world. It is the responsibility of all of us and of this parliament to do all that is needed to ensure that Pauline Hanson and her manipulators are exposed as peddlers of a farrago of inaccuracies, distortions and ignorance whose views cannot survive objective analysis and debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I entered the Senate after the 1984 election in august company. Those of us who were sworn in on 21 February 1985 were, from the coalition, Senators Brownhill, Knowles, Parer, Short and Vanstone. From Labor we had Senators Aulich, Black, Cooney, Devlin and McKiernan. From the Australian Democrats we had Senator Vigor. It is salutary to note that, after my departure, only six of those 11 senators will still be here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is indicative of the high quality of that 1984 intake however that, of the four remaining coalition senators, two, Senators Vanstone and Parer, are important ministers in the Howard government; one, Senator Brownhill, is parliamentary secretary to both the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson); and the fourth, Senator Knowles, has in the past been deputy whip, a member of the coalition frontbench and now plays an important role as chairman of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The two remaining Labor senators, Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan, are also distinguished members of this chamber. Without any disrespect to Senator McKiernan,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could I say of Senator Cooney that I believe he has made a unique contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the expansion of the Senate in 1984 from 10 to 12 senators from each state that enabled me to be elected. Whilst I of course welcome that, there is no doubt that this expansion has led to instability and makes it extremely difficult for the government of the day ever again to have control of the Senate. I share the concerns expressed by the outgoing Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Andrew Robb. I agree with him that the situation warrants urgent review. It is of course, though, much easier to identify the problem than to propose a practicable solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank Senator Hill, who has been coalition leader in the Senate for the past seven years, for all his support and encouragement, particularly during the period in which I served as his deputy in 1992-93. I thank you very much indeed, Robert, for everything. I also want to thank my other colleagues, and in particular my Victorian coalition senator colleagues Senators Alston, Kemp, Patterson, Troeth and McGauran for their friendship and cooperation over the years. My thanks extend to senators on all sides of politics. Some have become close friends and I hope that they will remain so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank the staff of the Senate for all their wonderful assistance to me over the years. It would be unfair to single out individuals, but I do want to put on record my deep appreciation of the work of the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, his deputy, Anne Lynch, and their assistants. They are tireless, they are always objective and rarely, if ever, do they lose the composure that I am sure our antics from time to time put under severe pressure. I thank also all of those persons who play such important roles in allowing us to perform our duties: the Transport Office, the Comcar drivers, Hansard, the highly professional staff of our many committees, the library staff, the attendants, the relevant officers of DAS&mdash;and there are many others as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all my personal staff over the years, I put on the record my heartfelt thanks for their professionalism, efficiency and friendship&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2964"> and I am delighted to see a couple of them here tonight. I have been very fortunate, indeed, to have had at all times a very supportive team. Most important of all, to my family and particularly to my dear wife, Jan, who is in the gallery tonight and who will be missed as convener of the Parliamentary Partners Association, may I thank you for putting up with me and supporting me so unfailingly in politics with all the stresses and strains over all these years on family life and on individual members of the family that political life brings. I only hope I may be able to repay you with more time, attention and care in the years ahead than I have during my political life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a wonderful privilege to have had the opportunity to serve in the federal parliament. I have been deeply honoured and feel deeply grateful to have had that opportunity. For that, I thank the Liberal Party for choosing me as one of its candidates and the people of Victoria for electing me. I have at all times tried to serve my Victorian constituents and the people of Australia&mdash;for all of whom we share a common responsibility as members of this national parliament&mdash;to the best of my ability. I hope I have succeeded in meeting the trust put in me. I wish my successor, Karen Synon, every success and enjoyment in her new life as a senator. I know that she will more than adequately fill my shoes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish Prime Minister John Howard and his government every success in the great challenges that lie ahead. I wish the Senate well in its vital role as parliamentary watchdog over the actions of the executive. I wish all of you well in your individual responsibilities and lives, both within and outside the parliament. It has been a great pleasure to be part of the team. I shall remember it with very fond memories for many years to come.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yours has been quite an extraordinary career when one looks at it&mdash;varied, eventful, exciting. You talked about highs and lows: certainly one can see the pitfalls, but you have also had a tremendous capacity, I might say, to land on your feet. After all, you lost your seat in the House of Representatives after five years, but you were elevated to the Australian Senate! After the unpleasant experience of October last year, you are now to be elevated to the exalted role of Alternate Executive Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Throughout your career, as I say, you seem to have landed on your feet with an even more challenging and interesting role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have, as you have told us, served in the House of Representatives for five years, and then for 13 years in the Senate. You have served on so many parliamentary committees that I will not take the time of the Senate to recall them tonight. You have served in our shadow ministry in finance, in home affairs and in immigration and ethnic affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the latter capacity, I particularly recall and remember with appreciation the way in which you gathered around you so many immigrants to our country, particularly those who came from what were referred to as the `captive nations'. But in your case it was the old captive nations of Europe and then a little later the new captive nations of Asia. All seemed to see in you somebody who was sympathetic to their interests, prepared to listen to their case and, perhaps most important, prepared to act rather than simply express support. You went out and worked for these people in a constructive and positive way. You have hinted at it but I can confirm that there are literally hundreds if not thousands of Australians who you probably do not know but who appreciate something that you did for them during those years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim, even before you got here, as you said, your career was varied. You worked in the Treasury, you were Private Secretary to the then Treasurer, the Rt Hon. Harold Holt, and you went into the private sector as General Manager, Corporate Affairs, for ACI. On that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2965"> basis, as I said, it has been an incredibly full public commitment and an interesting working life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, and you touched upon it also, that in coming here and in your service to the parliament you never forgot the political party that put you here. Your service to the Liberal Party as a country vice&hyphen;president in Victoria, a member of the Victorian Administrative Committee, Chairman of the Development Committee and a member of the Federal Strategy Committee put something back into the organisation of the party for the opportunity it gave to you to be a federal parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim, you will leave us and for that we will obviously be disappointed. You have been a good friend and a loyal colleague. Your approach to politics has always been that of the thoughtful kind: thoughtful, hardworking and dedicated to the beliefs that you hold. You mentioned some of those here tonight. You were always a team player&mdash;something that we will remember with gratitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim, I particularly wanted to take the opportunity to express my appreciation for your support during the years in which you were my deputy in this place. They were not necessarily easy years. Opposition, as that lot over there will find, is not a lot of fun, particularly as the years go by. There is your value as an economist and your value, as I said, as a thoughtful contributor; somebody who was always prepared to buck in and give the necessary speech. Some occasionally thought a little too often, I might say, but you would not be an orphan in politics for it to be suggested that you might speak too often. Yours was always a very strong contribution based on knowledge and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will miss you as a friend and a colleague, Jim. I wish you well in this next step in what I have said is obviously a fascinating career. I will miss Jan, as well. There are those who are lucky to travel, unlike me. I could be confident that you will find a guest or two from amongst your old political colleagues who might occasionally drop in on you in London. I am sure that they will receive a warm welcome from you. Jim, all the best to you and your family in the next step of your

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jim Short, by any measure, has had a unique political career&mdash;in many ways a classic example of the vicissitudes of this business. I think it would be undignified to call Jim a political junkie, but he has been in and around politics for getting on for 40 years and you have to have a special affinity for the craft to be that dedicated or that masochistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim has been a classic example of what we all admire about politics: someone who really took the responsibilities very seriously and who was very conscientious in the performance of his duties. I thought that finance was his forte and, as the shadow minister for finance over those turbulent years in the early 1990s, he really did bring to bear all the experience and knowledge of economics that had, in many ways, always fitted him uniquely for that role. I have to say that one of the great disappointments of his career&mdash;as it was for all of us, I suppose&mdash;has to be that we did not get to government in 1993. As it was something for which I think he was peculiarly well fitted, it must be an additional disappointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure of the man is that he then went on to become an excellent shadow
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2967"> minister for immigration and ethnic affairs&mdash;I think a very daunting, tiring task and one that involves endless rounds of functions. Not only did Jim perform those duties with diligence; I think he actually enjoyed them. He certainly had the respect of those who attended the functions and we always got very positive feedback in the Victorian division. It always seemed to me that he was, again, very well qualified for that role. It shows the breadth of his character and personality that he could, on the one hand, be very interested in financial and economic issues and, on the other hand, have a very keen interest in social issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You probably deserve to be the patron saint of lost causes, Jim, if you thought you could teach Boswell anything about economics, but I must say that, again, it shows a generosity of spirit that others probably could not bring to bear. We would all like to educate him in various ways, but I would never take on that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim and I actually went through a few contests together and I have to confess that in a couple of preselections he finished well in front of me. He also served in the Victorian organisation as vice&hyphen;president around the time that I was president and I was always very struck with the way in which he approached the business. It was not just a matter of numbers or a matter of politics; it was really a matter of the issues and the common welfare. Jim has always had that aspect to his political career that I think we all find very admirable. I know Jan is very proud of him and so she should be. He can leave this parliament with his head held high because he should have the satisfaction of knowing that he has played a very significant role in Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to see him leave. We even got to the point of being co&hyphen;tenants not so long ago. Now that he is moving on to a bigger and better house, he will probably enjoy himself greatly&mdash;and he has earned that reward. I am sure he will serve his country with distinction and I have no doubt he will be able to look back on a career that has brought us all great credit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to say farewell to another member of the class of 1984, I must admit that there were a few occasions during the period from 1993 to 1996 when I wished that Jim Short was actually moving then instead of waiting until now. I am referring, of course, in that time frame to when he was deputy to me on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration but also&mdash;and probably more importantly&mdash;to when he served as a member of Senate Estimates Committee E, which later became the Legal and Constitutional Committee, looking at matters associated with the Attorney&hyphen;General and the department of immigration. Jim certainly did put the officials through interminable questioning, going to the nth degree to get information&mdash;masses of information. I am not too sure what he ever did with it or whether it is of any use to the coalition now that they are in government. Nonetheless, there were many long hours spent in those committees gathering the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the other committee&mdash;the migration committee&mdash;in retrospect, it turns out that it was a very good and productive committee for the parliament, which is a mark not only of the chair, who generally gets the credit for these things, but of the committee itself, particularly the work of the deputy chair. If you can get the chair and the deputy chair working in committees&mdash;that is a hint to your colleague sitting beside you, Senator Abetz&mdash;you can produce constructive and productive work to benefit not only the parliament but also, more importantly, the community of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My other immediate association with Jimmy Short was when again he served as deputy to me on a parliamentary delegation that went to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the back end of 1993. Both of us on that occasion travelled separately to see some detention centres in South&hyphen;East Asia; detention centres which I am pleased to say have now closed and, hopefully, will never need to be opened again. Together, we&mdash;with the other members of the committee, including Senator Cooney&mdash;worked very hard to help Australia relieve
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2968"> itself of the problem created by people illegally entering this country. It was a contentious issue which was a very difficult issue for government to handle at the time. I think the committee, and the work of Senator Short as deputy on the committee, played a very constructive role in that. We did broaden ourselves and go beyond Australia to look at things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I promised Jim when we were in a town called Siem Reap in Cambodia, not far from Angkor Wat, after we spotted an Australian flag, that I would put it in the memory bank and remind him about it on another day. I have chosen tonight to be magnanimous and not further develop the story about that flag. That is in appreciation, Jim, of your assistance over the years and of your friendship and comradeship and that of Jan over the years. My wife, Jackie, asked that her best regards to you be recorded as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In joining with my colleague Senator Faulkner, I want wish you and your family all the very best for the future. I want to remind you that you are going to Europe at a particularly exciting time. I am not referring to the fact that there will be quite a large delegation of members of this house and the other place going to Europe in July&mdash;subject to the sitting of the Senate. I hope good sense will prevail on that. It is also a very exciting time not only for the Green Tiger, which is off where you are going to be living, but also for Britain itself. I am referring, of course, to the great happenings there last week when the British people exercised their wisdom and elected a Labour government to Westminster. I think, Senator Short, you will be seeing many ties like mine. You will be seeing lots of red ties with the Socialist rose on them. It is a very important time for you personally and a very important time for the institution you are going to join and represent Australia on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with your leader, my leader and all other  senators in this place in wishing you and Jan and all the other members of your family all the very best for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, join in the remarks that are being made about our colleague Senator Short. I, unlike some of them, feel it is a great loss to the parliament that you are going. I think your capacity for hard work is legendary. My staff pulled out some statistics today which have not yet been tabled. In your time in this parliament you made 1,448 speeches and asked 639 questions of Labor ministers in the parliament&mdash;this excludes all the estimates, I might say, and all the committees. We just could not do that work. I think Senator Hill made the comment that your efforts were thoughtful and weighty, and someone who has worked that hard is always going to be missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You listed a number of things which you thought were important. I would list a number of others. I think your sense of decency and your standards are a fine example to this parliament. No-one on either side would dispute that. Another feature is your very high intelligence. I have mentioned the contributions you have made. I might say that with that intelligence of yours you have reached a philosophy which I profoundly agree with. I certainly would be on the Jim Short team rather than the Ronnie Boswell team. And you would understand that Ronnie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you have an enormous capacity for friendship. The fact that there are so many in this chamber this evening is demonstration of that. I certainly have enjoyed your friendship over a long period. It is so long that I cannot even remember when and how we met. You might remember, but it has been a very long time. You have always been of assistance to me and most supportive, and that has been greatly appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to give some emphasis to&mdash;and it was touched on by Senator Hill&mdash;is that your interest in migrant groups has been very important to our party. Throughout the 1980s there were quite a number of migrant groups which were very unfashionable in this country. And, Jim, you were typically the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2969"> only politician at so many of those functions. In more recent years you cannot get a seat at the top table. But you, Jim, were the politician there amongst groups that were often perceived by the wider community as being unfashionable. They remember that. I have been to a number of functions in recent years, on your behalf on occasions, and your name is always spoken with great fondness. They remember that when people did not take an interest Jim Short was there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would like to mention briefly is the fact that Jim has been, as I said, an enormous help to me. I think it would be appropriate to mention the names of the staff that you were able to pass to me&mdash;all of whom speak highly of you and all of whom have been of enormous assistance to me. I mention: Richard King, Alan Mallory, Virginia Lopilato, Roger Brake, Mark Sheen and Angela Ryan, whom I worked with in my first six months in this job. The respect with which you are held at Treasury is well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the reasons that I have mentioned you will be greatly missed. Jan is a personal friend and we wish her well. She has been a great support to you over the years. I think you will, of course, miss our beloved Carlton. I hope we will be able to keep you deluged with reports of Carlton victory. That is another interest we share. I know you have a special interest in Paris. One of the advantages in being there is perhaps the closeness to Paris.

I first met Jim over 20 years ago when he was a senior officer in Treasury responsible for foreign investment. I did not know him very well, but I viewed him with great suspicion because at that time he was studiously trying to implement a Whitlam policy which he must have thought was lunacy. If he did, I might say that he gave no inkling of it at the time, which reflected his professionalism and dedication as a departmental officer whose role was to implement government policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a complete mystery and still is. As is the way with politics, I have shared the roller&hyphen;coaster ride of good and bad times with Jim&mdash;and, I might say, John Howard. Your career in politics, Jim, could certainly not be described as boring. One thing that stands out was the role that Jim Short played in Fightback. He referred to that as one of the five major issues in his career. At that time he was shadow minister for finance, and he was responsible for the costing of the package. He and his staff put in the most incredible number of hours over many months on the meticulous work that was required, often extending into the early hours of the morning. I know because he used to wake me up when he banged the door coming in. He had a workload that few could have sustained. Even though the 1993 election was lost because of an outrageous fear campaign, it was a credit to Jim that the figures for which he was responsible stood up to extreme scrutiny. As those on the other side of the chamber would know very well, Jim, you would have gone through them with a fine toothcomb. It was an onerous responsibility, as a single error could have destroyed the credibility of the document. Those opposite could not find a single error.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim is a man of deep principles and strong convictions. His beliefs are based on the fundamental precept of, and I quote from one of his speeches, `greater freedom of economic choice, a smaller role for government in terms of spending and taxing and in regulating our commercial and other activities and the encouragement and strengthening of the family'. This was reflected in his maiden speech in the Senate in which he identified the principles that would guide him when he said that, as a Liberal, he believed passionately that it was people&mdash;through economic freedom of the competitive market&mdash;who had built our nation, not government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have already given the details of Jim's distinguished career. To me he has been a true friend and a great gentleman. He leaves this place as we all will with the passage of time but he leaves it with his head held very high as a man of great integrity and principles who will be missed by the parliament, who will be a loss to the coalition, the nation, his home state of Victoria and his friends on both sides of the chamber. My wife, Kathi, and I will certainly miss the close relationship we have had with the Shorts over the past 10 years. I know that the break with parliament, particularly since we are in government, will be of great regret to Jim but I am sure that will be more than compensated for by his and Jan's ability to spend some time with their two grandchildren.

But I note from Jim's first Senate speech of March 1985 that he, too, learnt a number of salient lessons about the electorate in the interim, between his time in the House

He has invariably contended that the real issue facing all sectors of industry, both large and small, is competitiveness, and that the underlying cause of the decline in our business sector in the 1980s and early 1990s was the result of losing our competitive advantage against rival nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his bid to reverse the trend of Australia's decline from fourth to 20th per capita standard of living and from seventh to 23rd in export earnings over 30 years, Jim continually espoused the need for international competitiveness. The role of government, in pursuing this, he declared, was, among other things, to reduce the tax burden for business, to reduce the government's budget deficit and to reduce the size of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what he consistently fought for when the coalition was in opposition, particularly as chairman of the opposition's Industry, Commerce, Technology and Science Committee. And when the coalition won government in a landslide in 1996, it was this course of action which he pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On being appointed Assistant Treasurer, Jim Short brought to his portfolio the expertise Australia desperately needed after 13 years of mismanagement under Labor governments. This expertise had been achieved over many years, as he applied a remarkable intellect and assiduous hard work, which others have referred to, to the most difficult and wide&hyphen;ranging issues in the Australian financial world.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his early career in Treasury Senator Short rose very quickly to senior responsibilities. Between 1967 and 1970 he held the important position of Treasury representative in London. It is to London that he will be returning. It is London where he is still regarded in the greatest esteem for his competence and integrity, despite the passage of years. Between 1971 and 1975 he held two high level positions&mdash;Assistant Secretary in the Overseas Economic Relations Division and Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Investment Division of Treasury. From 1973 to 1974 he was Executive Secretary to the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On entering federal parliament as the member for Ballarat, he immediately took up a position on the Joint Statutory Committee for Public Accounts, where I first met him. I have always appreciated his wisdom ever since that first meeting. He also became a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, a position he held for nearly four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following his defeat in the election of 1980 he became General Manager, Corporate Affairs, of ACI International, a position which equipped him very suitably for service in the financial area of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his time in the Senate he has held a number of key positions where his informed contributions, especially in finance, have been of great benefit. These include being spokesman on finance and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. His outstanding ability to grasp the complexities of the economics scene has been an invaluable asset, not just to the government but to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Jim Short saw beyond the financial field. He saw the effects of financial management on the social structure of Australian society. In his maiden speech he highlighted the link between our taxation system and unemployment and poverty. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary aim of social policy must surely be to enable people to provide for themselves by their own efforts. We can make social progress in Australia only through economic discipline based on sound economic principles.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2973"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax reform should aim for equity, neutrality and simplicity, but within these parameters its overall objective must be to encourage the creation of income and wealth in an entrepreneurial environment in which effort is rewarded and economic growth and job creation encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He has also taken a keen interest in the people at the small end of town&mdash;the small businesses which have been over&hyphen;burdened with government regulation and crippled by industrial rigidity. It was Jim Short who in this chamber raised the matter of Dollar Sweets being strangled by union action when Telecom workers refused to restore their telephone service which had been cut off through union vandalism. Shortly afterwards those services were restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He pointed out in opening a debate on industry and business in 1985 that `we must create an environment in which all Australians are encouraged to dare to strive to achieve&mdash;as a nation there is no alternative.' I am sure it is very satisfying to Jim to see the gains made over the last year in reducing Australia's budget deficit, the reduction in the size of the government and the improved industrial relations regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short has consistently promoted privatisation as being an encouragement to greater competition. He saw that it was the only way of using the nation's assets efficiently. Through privatisation the government could fulfil its commitment to reducing the tax burden, reducing the deficit and reducing the size of government. It would have been very pleasing for them, therefore, I know, to see the legislation passed last year enabling part of Telstra to be privatised. The contribution he has made as a member of parliament over the last two decades will be remembered and valued for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Jim takes up his position, I wish to extend my very best wishes not only to him but to his wife, Jan, who is in the gallery tonight. I am confident that this new era in their lives will be exciting, challenging and rewarding. I thank you for a job well done.</PARA>

You have done nothing but enhance that first impression that I had. So to be saying goodbye to you, Jim, is to be closing the book on a chapter of our lives that has in the main been highlighted by good times.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and Jan really do deserve a wonderful time in London while you go about doing a job for which you are eminently qualified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You at least had the dignity, through no illegality but a sheer oversight, to resign.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a fellow Victorian senator, I would like to pay tribute to the work that you have contributed to this parliament and to your role in the wider world. You certainly brought the knowledge of many worlds to this parliament when you came here in 1975. Not least, as the member for Ballarat and from your birthplace in Shepparton you brought an understanding of rural Victoria. That is something that is very important for every member of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were unfortunate enough to leave your House of Representatives seat in 1980 and it was four years before you were elected to the Senate. Between those years your interest and enthusiasm for the Liberal Party did not flag. You were a country vice&hyphen;president in 1982, a member of our administrative committee, a chair of the party development committee, and you have always been a very enthusiastic member of our federal strategy committee from 1985 onwards. You and I have played a role on that together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I looked at your first speech, there were probably two or three strands running through it which you exhibited at the time and which you have continued to exhibit in the rest of your parliamentary life. The themes that you stressed then and have carried on are the necessity for economic growth of our nation and the necessity for tax reform, which also encourages the creation of income and wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed when reading your first speech that you foreshadowed many of the successful industrial relations reforms which we have implemented since we have come to government. I know that they were very important
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2975"> to you. Last but not least you stressed the importance of the private sector in any economy. That is something that you have always emphasised. You also mentioned youth unemployment, which unfortunately is still with us today, and, true to the Christian values that I know you hold, a promotion of the basic values that everyone should feel in their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As both Senator Kemp and Senator Hill have mentioned, your later roles as shadow minister for multicultural Australia, immigration, ethnic and citizenship affairs, and later on immigration and ethnic affairs were particularly successful ones. The amount of work which you have done in Victoria and Australia wide with these groups is simply phenomenal. Like Senator Kemp, I want you to know that every group that we visit on your behalf speaks well of you. During the last few weeks when I have represented you and Minister Ruddock with ethnic affairs groups, every one of them wished to pass on their very best wishes. They all spoke extremely well of you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was fortunate enough to be in third position on the Senate ticket when you were positioned first in 1993. I would like to thank you very much for the education process you put me through during the 1993 campaign and in our subsequent work in the Senate. You have always been renowned for your hard work, Jim, whether it is in an area of policy development for which you have worked or the other areas that I have mentioned, not to mention the very long list of committee work which takes up much of the entry in the parliamentary handbook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention Jan. Jan, you have not only been a most supportive partner for Jim; you have also had a career of your own.

You will be sadly missed as well as Jim.</PARA>

I think that is why there are so many people here tonight. You are held in very high regard by all your colleagues. Somebody said to me once when I came here, `You might be a nice person now, but you will not be as nice a person when you leave.' I am sure when you came here you were a person of honour and integrity. Unlike some who are tarnished by the time here, I do not think one can say that about you. You have not been tarnished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed while sitting in the chair tonight that nearly every person mentioned the words `honour', `honourable' or `integrity'. If you had to choose words to describe you, I think they would be the words. I think people say that about very few politicians when they leave. I think it is a great credit to you that during that time you have shown honour, integrity, great loyalty and friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big ladder you hit to go to this new job also meant that I had a small ladder because I was then able to go to the United Nations.

Your part in and contribution to that will always, I believe, be recognised as very, very significant in what has happened, as I said, over the last 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned the term `economic dries and rationalists'. I well remember at that particular time people trying to denigrate what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2978"> was being done and others being thumped around and branded with such names as the New Right, et cetera. I think now that time has proven that it was economic commonsense. I pay tribute to you for your contribution to that economic commonsense and reform, which was really about providing a larger cake for all Australians to enjoy. Of course, as time goes by, that becomes very evident. Your principles as far as economic fundamentals are concerned I think are well understood and have been adopted not by all but virtually by most sides of politics in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would touch just briefly on the industrial reform arena, in which you also played a significant part. Your philosophy was to create higher productivity so that there was an opportunity for all Australians to enjoy in increased wealth and more job opportunities. That also has stood the test of time. Others have mentioned a range of matters, from ethnic affairs with your contribution on committees, and what have you, which I will not go over other than to acknowledge them and congratulate you on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join these tributes that have been rendered this evening to my retiring colleague Jim Short. Jim and I were elected together in the House of Representatives on 13 December 1975. Subsequent to that, we both served in both of the chambers of this parliament&mdash;both for approximately 17&half; years. Our careers in parliament do not exactly overlap. I think Jim had from 1975 to 1980 in the Reps, about five years, whereas I was there until 1983. But Jim has been in the Senate since late 1984, whereas in my case I have been here since mid&hyphen;1987. So I guess, quite clearly, Jim can claim to be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more senatorial than I am&mdash;and that was certainly reflected in his remarks in his speech tonight. I also recall that, at one stage during our time together in the Reps, he claimed me as a protege. I am not quite sure whether he would still want to make that claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But along with that other recently departed Senate colleague Michael Baume, who also commenced his parliamentary career in 1975, Jim and I were amongst that group of new members who delighted in the epithet `oncers' that was hurled at us across the chamber by the then Labor opposition in the first term of the Fraser coalition government. Virtually all of those so-called oncers survived to become twicers&mdash;and that was Jim's achievement&mdash;and some of us to be thricers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventy-fivers were indeed a close&hyphen;knit group, and their extracurricular activities contributed a lot to the morale of the then Fraser coalition government. To this day, they have maintained an annual dinner get&hyphen;together, and over the years three groups of those oncers have emerged&mdash;the survivors, those who have continuously served in this Parliament to the present day; the resurrected, those who for one reason or another were defeated in their seats and returned either to other lower house seats or as senators; and, indeed, the departed, those who were defeated not to return or, in more recent years, those who retired voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim has always played a very prominent part in those get&hyphen;togethers, and our departed colleagues who have returned either regularly or intermittently to those get&hyphen;together dinners have always been eager to catch up with Jim and share some time with him. And I am sure that the departed will welcome his second coming to their numbers&mdash;this time, it occurring voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim was a significant backbench member in the House of Representatives and, as Winston Crane mentioned a few moments ago, he was a leading advocate of the importance of economic rectitude and the benefits of a market economy and less interventionist government&mdash;the so-called dry philosophy, to which Jim referred in his own remarks. Of course, that was not as fashionable a philosophy at that time as it has become in more
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2979"> recent years, and certainly Jim's advocacy during that period was very important in the Liberal Party becoming more committed to that philosophy in the 1980s and the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim suffered defeat at the 1980 election in his House of Representatives seat of Ballarat, but he showed the courage and the persistence to return to this place as a senator. In the context of the overall numbers of people who serve in this place, in the history of this parliament there are not all that many members who, once defeated, actually return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in the Senate that Jim's career really blossomed. Most of his period as a senator has been spent on the front bench, either in economic or migration related portfolios. I guess the highlight of his career here was, firstly, his period as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, more recently, as Assistant Treasurer. He certainly did not deserve the fate that befell him recently as a minister in a portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combination of his parliamentary experience and background in Treasury certainly equips him brilliantly for his new career as Australia's representative director on the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I have valued Jim's wise counsel and advice over the years we have served together in both chambers of this parliament but, above all, I have valued his friendship&mdash;although, I have to say, that friendship was strained on that AFL finals day in 1993 at Waverley when together we watched Carlton just pip the Adelaide Crows for the direct route to the grand final.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife, Sally, has also valued her friendship with Jan over the years that Jim and I have served together in the parliament. I am sure she joins me in wishing them both well as they meet new challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that, with Baume in New York and Short in London, the oncers are certainly well placed on the international stage. I am sure I speak for all oncers&mdash;survivors, resurrected and departed&mdash;in wishing Jim and Jan a happy respite from politics, and great success and enjoyment in London. I am sure that we all wish that occasionally you will be able to return to

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, I want to thank you on behalf of thousands of people who cannot be here. They are particularly the Chinese dissidents who were left stranded here as a result of Tiananmen Square. I want to put on record that your contribution in achieving and easing a bipartisan acceptance of their place in our community will not go unnoticed. There are many thousands of people whose lives you have changed through the work that you quietly achieved in 1993. I am here to bear testimony to what you did and thank you on their behalf. You were truly great in what you did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I want to give you my thanks because when I arrived here as a young 24-year-old you were one of the people who actively encouraged me to get involved in the economic debate, to get involved in the life of the chamber, to get involved in the work of the committees. For that I thank you very much because it made me feel like I was somebody who could make a difference. Jim, you have had a great influence on me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say in conclusion that I know you are going to the European Bank for Economic Reconstruction and Development. I might note in Senator Boswell's defence that, having had the opportunity to observe Russia's unbridled economics, Jim might be coming back in a couple of months time to ask Senator Boswell some advice on a few matters of government regulation of the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to say that I have very much appreciated the time that I have spent in this parliament with Jim Short. I remember exactly where I was, as I guess everyone else remembers where they were&mdash;I remember because of the shock that hit me&mdash;on the morning that I heard the announcement that Jim had resigned from the frontbench of the Howard government after such a short
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time. I was going for a walk at Scarborough Beach with young Edward, and it was late spring. I was in shock, Jim, as I said to you at the time by way of a letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had very privately&mdash;because I had never said this to Jim or probably anyone else&mdash;as a young senator coming into this place, virtually the same week as Senator O'Chee, as I recall, having met Jim on the tennis court on the first freezing cold morning I was here, found very quickly that Jim was an inspiration to me. I think that is probably the best thanks that a younger senator can give to an older senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did inspire me for a couple of reasons, and I will not take too much time. The first reason was his work ethic in this place. We are elected to this place to work very hard. As Jim said in his own speech, it is a great honour and privilege to be elected to serve in the Australian parliament. Hundreds and thousands of people try over the years to get here and very few do. So, when you get here, it is a great honour and privilege, and you are expected to and should work extremely hard in your chosen fields. In all of the portfolio areas and policy areas that Jim has had responsibility for throughout his distinguished career, he has shown that work ethic. He has always gone the extra yard in terms of putting the extra work in and, because of his intellect and his commitment, that has borne fruit for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason why Jim has been an inspiration to me is that he came to this place, if you read his maiden speech, with a very clear policy framework, a very clear philosophical framework and a commitment to an ideology, principles and a philosophy which he has brought and carried through his entire career. Many people come here with fine ideals and a strong sense of philosophy and principles and see them whittled away. Jim has stuck by those and it is a philosophy that he and I share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a philosophy that supports economic freedom and believes that economic freedom helps to create political freedom in other parts of world. But, most importantly at home, a commitment to smaller government, lower taxes, less state intervention and less regula
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2981"> tion of the private sector to ensure that individuals can maximise their own place in this society and therefore help the whole society is a commitment that we share. It was an unpopular commitment through much of the 1980s. But we did, Jim, as you say, win the battle of ideas not only here in Australia but around the globe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, Senator McKiernan refers to the victory of the Blair New Labour Party in Great Britain. He did not tell the Senate of course that in the United Kingdom and the United States in recent elections both of the parties of the centre left there have had to dump their traditional tax and spend policies, their `big government, big intervention' policies. The Clinton administration and the Blair New Labour government have had to dump those policies and effectively adopt policies that could broadly be termed as economically rational. That was a prerequisite to Mr Blair getting elected and that is support for the philosophies in a way that you have supported all your career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim, I earnestly say that you have provided inspiration. You said to me when you announced your resignation that we must keep the faith, keep the torch blowing and stick to our guns on these important principles, philosophies and ideologies. I can give you a commitment that I will. I do not need to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will. We will be here, we will be fighting, we will be thinking of you in London and we will miss you at tennis in the mornings and in the chamber during the days, but we do look forward to seeing you again. Thank you for everything you have done for me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I conclude by saying that I did not know Jan very well. But, Jan, I can say that my wife, Brenda, never used to enjoy the parliamentary spouses association. She used to shun it and she did not enjoy going along. But, since you have taken over, she has taken a big interest. So it must be a remarkable achievement by you. So best wishes to you as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The in-principle decision to retain access to the Mt McCall Road was taken by the full Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Ministerial Council. In making my decision in relation to this matter, I was mindful of the fact that the closure of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Road was a requirement contained in the Management Plan for the World Heritage area. My general view is that World Heritage Management Plans should not be amended without good cause. In this instance, I was persuaded by the fact that the Road provides a valuable opportunity for members of the public to view parts of the World Heritage area that are normally only seen by the hardiest of bushwalkers. Similarly, I was concerned that a decision to close the Road would bring to an end the shorter rafting trips along the Franklin River which are important for the Tasmanian tourism industry. By allowing visitors to experience the environment around Mt McCall and along the Franklin, I believe that we can actually increase support and appreciation for the protection of Tasmania's south-west among both Tasmanians and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The World Heritage values of this region will continue to be protected. Enhanced measures will be introduced to address any possible impacts on values, including actions to limit access to responsible users, the establishment of wash-down facilities for vehicles and the investigation of the resurfacing of key sites to reduce visual and environmental impacts. The Ministerial Council also agreed to continue the revegetation of verges along the Road to reduce the impact of erosion and provide further camouflaging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a)&mdash;(d) I have received many representations from a wide range of sources relating to the Mt McCall Road since March 1996. These representations presented widely diverging views in relation to the management of the road, and provided an equally diverse range of information in support of particular views. Included among them, were representations from the Tasmanian Government. I do not intend to make available copies of the documentation I have received on this matter. To do so would incur a heavy workload on my Department which I do not consider to be warranted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In 1995, OECD member countries (including Australia) endorsed the commencement of negotiations for a Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). The Government endorses an MAI that would strengthen the framework for international investment flows. This objective should be achievable while maintaining Australia's foreign investment policy and taking into account respective Commonwealth/State responsibilities in this area as provided for under the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In the administration of foreign investment policy, the Government applies the most&hyphen;favoured&hyphen;nation (MFN) principle whereby all foreign investors are treated equally, regardless of their country of origin. Since the requirements of Australia's foreign investment policy necessarily involve different treatment for foreign investors relative to Australian investors, Australia does not accord full "national treatment" for foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The May 1997 Ministerial Council meeting of the OECD is not expected to adopt the MAI. An extension of time for the negotiations is now expected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Brown's question raises issues which fall within the portfolio responsibilities of both the Minister for Resources and Energy and myself. As such, I have consulted with my colleague, Senator Parer, about this matter and the following reply represents the Government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Nine environmental conditions were recommended by the incumbent Minister for the Environment in April 1991, in relation to the granting of a total volume Mineral Export Permit for mineral sand mined on North Stradbroke Island and following examination of the proposal under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. These recommendations were subsequently incorporated as conditions attached to the Mineral Export Permit granted by the Minister for Resources and Energy</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the recommendations has been forwarded to the honourable senator and additional copies are available from the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the terms of the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901 it is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3001"> the Minister for Resources and Energy, or the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) on behalf of the Minister, that is responsible for the granting of Mineral Export Permits, and any conditions applied to the granting of such permits. Notwithstanding this formal position, there was, of course, close consultation between my Department and DPIE following the reporting of an incident in October last year at the Gordon mine. See (3) below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Department of Mines and Energy (QDME) has the primary responsibility for environmental oversight of the mining operations on a day to day basis and I am informed that DPIE liaises with QDME concerning environmental management of Consolidated Rutile's (CRL) operations on North Stradbroke Island, and that QDME monitors compliance with all environmental performance conditions, including those attached to the Mineral Export Permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) Following the reporting of the off-lease seepage of clean water at the Gordon mine and given the possible implications for CRL's export approval, two DPIE officers and an officer from the Environment Protection Group travelled to Brisbane in early November 1996 to discuss the incident and appropriate remedial action with QDME and CRL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Resources and Energy recently advised me that, given the nature of the Gordon incident, he had undertaken a formal review of CRL's export approval and concluded that the relevant environmental concerns were being adequately addressed through State environmental processes. He therefore decided that no further action was necessary in relation to this incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In coming to this decision, the Minister for Resources and Energy emphasised to me that his Department would continue to liaise closely with QDME to ensure that the requirements of CRL's export approval are adequately met. He has also asked his Department to continue liaising with Environment Australia on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b &amp; c) The Queensland Department of Mines and Energy has advised that their most recent compliance assessment (equivalent to an audit) was conducted on 5 November 1996, and that there have been five separate site inspections since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The outcomes of these assessments and site inspections include a Notice to Show Cause (why the mining lease not be withdrawn) in relation to off-site seepage of clean water, an Order to Comply in relation to the provision of hydrological assessments for mine planning of two current dredge operations, and seven written directives relating to several other aspects of the environmental management performance of the company, from improving fuel storage and delivery systems to downgrading the CRL performance category and consequent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase in the security deposit held by QDME for CRL operations. The Queensland Department of Mines and Energy has advised that the company has responded appropriately to these orders and directives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) I have been advised that copies of relevant reports and related material held by QDME are available from the Department at&mdash;Queensland Minerals and Energy Centre, 61 Mary Street, Brisbane, Queensland 4000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) See (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) As explained at (2) above, these are matters for consideration by Senator Parer. CRL's Mineral Export Permit requires the Minister for Resources and Energy to review the company's export approval if the permit's conditions and objectives are not being adequately met. Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, the Minister for Resources and Energy has the power to revoke a Minerals Export Permit if the person who holds the permit has failed to comply with a condition or requirement of the permit. However, in considering such an option, the Minister for Resources and Energy would need to ensure that he had provided the permit holder with an opportunity to make submissions about the proposed decision, in order to meet the requirements of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) See (5) above. In addition to addressing the immediate environmental impacts raised by the Gordon incident, CRL has made a long term commitment to improving its environmental management practices on North Stradbroke Island and to extending the scope of premining environmental assessments for both existing and future projects on the Island. These commitments include an undertaking by the Company to revise its Environmental Management Overview Strategy and to increase consultation with community groups.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commonwealth provided New South Wales with $192,293 over the 1994/95 and 1995/96 financial years to undertake the assessment and preparation of the nomination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. The nomination document was prepared with contributions from a number of national and international experts. The document argues that the property meets three of the six criteria for Cultural Heritage under the terms of the World Heritage Convention.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth has spent $404,180 on projects directly relating to the conservation of the orange-bellied parrot over the past ten years. In addition to this there has been a significant combined cash and in-kind contribution made by the State Governments of Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The above Commonwealth expenditure, combined with the contribution of the range States, has resulted in the build up of a considerable amount of knowledge on the orange-bellied parrot. This includes knowledge of its habitat usage and requirements, population numbers and structure, breeding biology and other ecological information. This knowledge has been brought together in a Recovery Plan for this species, which is being implemented in a cooperative manner by the Commonwealth and the range States. The most significant advance made by the implementation of this recovery plan is the apparent stabilisation of the previously declining population of the species, largely through better habitat management and protection in both wintering and breeding areas. Other promising achievements are the development of more robust population census techniques, successful captive breeding of the species and the subsequent successful re-introduction of some captive-bred birds to supplement other measures taken to increase the wild population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) While it is not possible to be absolutely certain of impacts, I understand that with a suitable well-resourced management program combined with guarantees of perpetual habitat protection throughout the western coasts of Port Phillip Bay, the construction of a chemical storage facility at Point Lillias is likely to have a minimal, if not negligible, impact on the survival of the orange-bellied parrot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) This assessment is based on advice from my Department and the assessment conducted by the Victorian Government as part of their Environment Effects Statement studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The reduction in amenity for the species caused by construction of a chemical storage facility at Point Lillias would be outweighed by the measures summarised above, i.e. a properly managed and resourced conservation program coupled with reserve protection of habitat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) A final figure on the cost of the changes is not yet available, but the original estimate of $2.7m is accurate at this time. It should be noted that this cost pertains to the one&hyphen;off gratuitous issue to current serving junior sailors; longer term savings will result, as the New Junior Sailors' uniforms are less expensive to provide to males ($53.35 cheaper) and females ($347.35 cheaper) on entry, based on the current clothing price list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The changes provide greater alignment of uniforms between genders at the junior sailor level, remove items which are obsolete relative to contemporary dress norms, and reduce the range of clothing items that make up RAN uniforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The change in uniform was affected following the 1994 RAN Uniform Survey, which revealed that 67 percent of those personnel surveyed were in favour of the change. An extensive consultation process took place both in initiating and conducting the uniform survey, and as a result of the survey findings. All RAN personnel have the opportunity to raise uniform issues at any time and a feed back system (called `Stitch This'), where ideas are put forward by members to the Director of Supply Policy, has been in place for some years. In the case of the 1994 survey, in addition to the feedback system, 3000 survey forms were widely disseminated throughout the RAN and 2100 were subsequently returned useable. This represented a surveyed population base of approximately 14.7 percent of the RAN Permanent Naval Forces. The results of the survey were subsequently considered by the Naval Planning Committee (one star level) and the Chief of Naval Staff's Advisory Committee (two star level), before being approved by Chief of the Navy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The use of the term `trade mark agent' will be protected in accordance with the provision of the Trade Marks Act 1995, which carried through from the Trade Marks Act 1955, because of its close similarity with the term "trade mark attorney" and because there are persons who continue to have a legitimate right to use the term. The term "Agent for obtaining the registration of trade marks" is not a restricted term under the existing legislation and the Government does not intend to restrict the use of that term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government does not consider use of the term "Agent for obtaining the registration of trade marks" should be restricted given its objectives to open access to professional service in the field of trade marks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) See 2 above.
