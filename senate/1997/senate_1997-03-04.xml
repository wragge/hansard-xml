<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister. Are you aware that on the radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  last night the President of the Australian Bar Association, Mr Chris Pullen, expressed concern about both your government's as well as Premier Borbidge's attacks on the High Court which he described `as unprecedented in the last 20 to 30 years'? Are you also aware that on the same program the Attorney-General said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if courts generally are slow if making decisions, that's a proper subject for comment. . . But when you get down to an individual case, it comes very close to making a criticism on a personal ground of the court, of individual members of the court, and that's not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is it not true Deputy Prime Minister Fischer criticised the court saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am frustrated and angered by the delay in handing down of the decision by the High Court of Australia with regard to the Wik case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is it not true that Mr Borbidge described Sir Gerard Brennan's defence of the court as `pathetic and lamentable'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do. I think it is reasonable to be frustrated about delays in important cases that have an effect upon so many Australians. Beyond that, of course, it is reasonable to assess the reasons for such delay and the court might have arguments on its side in that regard. I am not sure, but I certainly see it as legitimate for the Deputy Prime Minister to say that he and his constituents are frustrated by important cases taking so long to be decided.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comments on the High Court when he called them a `bunch of dills' and he likened them to `kings and queens of old' and Mr Fischer's comment when he called one of Justice Kirby's statements `awful'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is a good idea for the Labor Party to talk about polls today. They may well have noted that we are now polling better than we did at the election. Twelve months later, after taking a lot of hard decisions to address the economic mess that we inherited from you lot&mdash;$8,000 million of deficit&mdash;we take those hard decisions and our poll actually rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the issue of our rising polls, yes, as I said to you yesterday, we accept a responsibility to ensure that the public maintains confidence in the High Court and confidence in our judicial system. It is an important part of our democracy and we will accept responsibility, but we certainly have the right to say we disagree with particular judgments. There is nothing new in that and there is nothing wrong with that. We have certainly got to right to say we are frustrated because judgments are taking so long to be put down. Beyond that, I do not think I have anything else to add.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Minister for the Environment. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's release yesterday of the oceans policy discussion paper and his announcement of new initiatives to complement the policy development. What had been the reaction to the release of the discussion paper and to the government's funding commitments which accompany it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1171" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for that very important question. It reminds me, now that Senator Bolkus has got me focused on polls, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  did a poll on the community's assessment of this government's environmental management. I am pleased to advise you that the community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1172"> gave us a 70 per cent rating, which is not bad. Of course what it means is that the community actually accepts that attempting to support development and job growth consistent with sound economic management is the way that the community would wish to see its government go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But yesterday, consistent with that philosophy again, the Prime Minister took another step towards the government's commitment of producing an integrated oceans policy for Australia. We will be one of the very few countries in the world that has actually tackled that challenge, partly because it is so difficult and partly because the concentration in the past has been on the land mass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is worth remembering that our ocean responsibilities&mdash;the extended economic zone&mdash;now cover something like twice the size of our land mass, and with it comes new economic opportunities together with new environmental responsibilities. What this government has said&mdash;consistent again with an election promise&mdash;is that we will produce an oceans policy for the first time in the history of  Australia that addresses that enormous challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we did yesterday was to issue a discussion paper which will now be out in the community for a couple of months. We look forward to community input on it. We are a government the engages the community in these processes. From that we will be producing options papers which we will put back to the community later this year. Out of that, by next year when we get to the international year of oceans, we should be in a position to deliver on our promise in full and that is produce an integrated oceans policy for Australia. The sorts of issues that we are looking at in this challenge are the issues of the marine environment, issues of pollution, issues of industry development, our international relations, indigenous issues and so they go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are challenging; they are difficult. There is no doubt about that. But, again, it is our responsibility to work out how we can maximise our economic opportunity from the oceans whilst at the same time preserve that unique environment. We still do not know 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enough about it. Therefore, we need more science. We need a better information base. You would expect that we would be cautious. We do not want to make the same mistakes in relation to oceans that we have made in relation to our land mass. We want to learn from the mistakes of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor knocked this; they could not see any relevance, but it was heartening to see community interest groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature coming out and warmly welcoming our approach. The Australian Marine Conservation Society also welcomed the release of the paper and wanted to be involved in its further development. That is a good sign.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only criticism I heard was from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, who failed to understand that there was an APEC environment ministers' conference last year in the Philippines in which the exact issue I have been talking about&mdash;protecting the marine environment within the Asia Pacific region&mdash;was regarded as one of the three most vital issues facing this community. We took that up. We participated in that debate. It has been taken on by Canada, which, as the leader of APEC for this year, will be part of that process also. Regrettably, I have heard of the criticism, but it was by somebody who was unaware of the leadership that Australia is playing in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<QUESTION PAGE="1173" SPEAKER="Carr, Sen Kim" NAMEID="AW5" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, what action will you be taking to protect the government's budget cuts of $214 million following the tightening of the Austudy actual means test? Hasn't it now been six days since you were made aware of the Department of Social Security's legal advice that highlights the lack of substantive legislative provision of the Austudy actual means test regulations? Will you now concede that these regulations will not withstand `a half&hyphen;hearted legal challenge'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1173" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for that question, Senator Carr. As with a lot of recent reporting on this subject, there is a serious inaccuracy contained within your question. First, the so-called legal opinion that I think you are referring to is not considered legal advice; rather, a draft working paper circulated by a relatively junior officer in the Department of Social Security without any sort of departmental approval. That is, it is one person's opinion&mdash;and not the senior person's with respect to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it is important to understand that the legal basis of the AMT on which this government has not and will not back down remains that established by Labor. The test is as good as the legal basis your previous government gave it. The key provisions of the regulations established by Labor were the estimation of actual means by reference to the total expenditure and savings of the applicants. That has not changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major change which I approved in July last year was the use of self&hyphen;assessment in place of imputation. That did not require a change in regulations at all. It was purely a question of administrative process and customer service. The subsequent use by departmental officers of a form of imputation as a means of assessment rather than as a compliance check was a departure from the process that I approved in July last year. It is a matter that I take seriously. As you know, from having been at the estimates, the matter is currently under investigation in the department. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, Senator Carr, that you seem to be pleased that the test Labor established is now under question. However, we would be interested to know what you think of and whether you agree with a further observation in the paper: that is, that the bulk of the people affected by the actual means test are likely to be those people who have the legal resources available to challenge the regime. In other words, do you agree that an actual means test is necessary? Do you agree that it is targeted at people with real means? Because you need plenty of dough to challenge a government these days and that has been the case for some time</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the author of the paper believes that the test has successfully identified the people it was intended to catch&mdash;those who legally but artificially lower their incomes. If you do think that we need such a test, then you ought to say so. If you don't, you equally ought to come out and say so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must understand, Senator Carr, that the actual means test was established by your government. It has been left in place by our government. There were some changes that we made. The essential changes that related to the difficulties in the early part of the year were not in conformity with the brief that I signed off in July. You, therefore, have very substantial responsibility should there be a problem. I remind you in conclusion that this was an independent note written by a relatively junior officer in the department and, in that sense, it is not the Department of Social Security's view.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, do I take it from your answer that you do concede there are legal problems with the regulations? Further, do you recall that at the EET estimates you said that you were considering tabling your department's legal advice on the Austudy regulations of February 1997? Will you now table that advice?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1173" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you understand, Senator Carr, that advice relates to a separate matter in relation to the AMT. Let us have no confusion that we are talking about one and the same piece of advice. In one sense we are talking about legal advice = that is the advice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1174"> that I was referring to in the estimates. In another sense, we are talking about the view of a relatively junior officer in the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that you have put so much credence on the view of the junior officer in the DSS&mdash;which I assume you do since you have bothered to take up a question with it&mdash;and since that indicates that the people affected by the actual means test are people with real means who might challenge the government, I have to think very seriously about whether I would prejudice the Commonwealth's position and release that advice to you. I am afraid, by giving such emphasis to the junior officer's view, you have led me to pretty well conclude that the answer to that question is no.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I ask the minister a question that concerns another very important election commitment which has been honoured by this coalition government. I refer to the previous Labor government's failure to introduce an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date and workable moral rights copyright regime which recognises the rights of artists. What progress has the government made in delivering its promise to legislate for very long overdue copyright reform in this area which provides fair and adequate protection for artists?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was in the too hard basket for years. You might remember what Mr Keating had to say when he was crying in his cups when he thought he had lost the 1993 election. He was out there saying, `What have we done for the arts? Everyone says that we are for the arts, but what have we done? Not much and it is about time we did something for them.' He then proceeded to come up with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creative Nation </EMPHASIS> after innumerable adjournments and delays and ministers being trumped. But they could never bite the bullet on moral rights. It was all too hard. It left the arts community with a feeling of great disillusionment because there were some who were misguided enough to think that the Keating government was fair dinkum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They actually voted for us, not you.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the time we got to the election last year, Senator Cook, they were very much disillusioned with what had actually been put on the table. That is why it is very important that this government is now in a position to announce that we are able to implement our pre-election commitment. We have always said that we regard copyright reform as a major area. In the instance of moral rights, we are now able to announce that the copyright bill, which will be introduced into the parliament shortly, will contain a very good regime to implement our international obligations under the Berne convention. We are going down the path that has  been followed by a number of other countries, including the United States, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France and Germany.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing essentially is recognising that artists&mdash;that is a fairly broad category; those who are creators of product in the area of cultural activity&mdash;are entitled to be identified as the authors of those works. They are entitled to protection against false attribution and they also have a right of integrity to complain where there is degradation or interference with their works. A classic example of that would be Aboriginal artists who have been left high and dry for very many years in this area. For example, if an Aboriginal artist has produced a painting which is then adapted to a T-shirt or a tea towel, that can very much 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1175"> degrade the whole cultural and spiritual significance of the original work. Until a moral rights regime is in place, there is simply nothing that they can do about it. That is one of the areas that has been crying out for reform and where this government has been prepared to take that action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these reforms, authors, artists and film makers, both producers and directors, will have the right to assert a moral right, not an economic right, but one that can be protected in a court of law if necessary by way of injunction. It will be balanced against the reasonableness test so that there will be the opportunity to reflect industry standards and concerns to ensure that you simply cannot hold up the reproduction of a work by a trivial claim. But the principle is a very important one&mdash;that is, those who do have a right ought to be able to assert it and ought to be able to be recognised as having that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not apply to all elements of the arts. Indeed, the Film Finance Commission was arguing against a right to film producers and directors. We do not share that view. But we certainly take the view that the right that attaches to a script writer should not then be allowed to follow through in the process. Ultimately, these rights will be able to be waived. They will apply for 50 years in accordance with normal practice. Those rights will be very distinct from the economic rights which exist in a copyright work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very significant and long overdue reform, one which this government is delighted to be able to say it is delivering in spades to the arts community, which has been pressing for these reforms. It is very much an indication that we are serious and Labor was not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

Rockdale council has expressed an interest in a tourism and conference development at the airport and, as a result of that interest, a concept document is being worked up by the council.

We tried to remove export controls and, from a pricing point of view, we have done that. The export controls are a hangover from Rex Connor and Gough Whitlam; that is how far back they go.

You should recognise that two of the badly needed initiatives for Australian families were the family tax initiative and the family tax payment, which were very well supported and recognised by groups like the Salvation Army, ACOSS and others. They only got it in January this year. That is a recognition of the financial stress that many people in Australia were facing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, in its first budget, immediately substantially increased the emergency relief payments going to those organisations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corrigendum was publicly released when the Department of Finance was confident that all errors had been detected and corrected. The Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1187"> received a draft corrigendum on Thursday, 13 February and the corrigendum was publicly released on Wednesday, 19 February. This included the necessary time taken by Treasury to have the corrigendum published by the Australian Government Publishing Service. The department first advised the government when they wrote to the Treasurer and the then acting Finance Minister on Thursday, 6 February. Having initially discovered an error, the government rightly requested the Department of Finance to thoroughly check and double&hyphen;check for any further errors and to put in place processes to ensure that future errors are not made. This comprehensive, thorough approach is the usual and appropriate approach when releasing a corrigendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corrigendum was publicly released. It was circulated to the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts, to all senators, to the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops and key users, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Australia. This ensured that all Senate estimates committees were fully informed prior to the additional estimates hearings. Parliament was not sitting in the week the corrigendum was released. Subsequently the corrigendum was tabled in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today, relating to changes to the means test for eligibility to receive Austudy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Today we have been witness to the most extraordinary of propositions. This minister suggests that there was not a legal opinion given to the Department of Social Security. This minister suggests that a junior officer prepared a discussion paper. I think we are entitled to ask: what is the difference between a discussion paper and a legal opinion? It would seem to me that the real difference here is the content&mdash;whether or not you agree with the content&mdash;and, some others more cynical than I would suggest, if it was in private practice, perhaps the price.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a situation where advice was given not just to a junior officer, as the minister would have us believe, but to three assistant secretaries. The First Assistant Secretary, Retirement Programs Division; First Assistant Secretary, Family Programs Division; the First Assistant Secretary, Labour Market and Disability Programs Division were given advice from the legal and legislative branch of the Department of Social Security that presented a scathing critique of the Austudy means test regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the estimates last week, we heard that the current regulations that this government is operating under contain the same legal flaws&mdash;that this government has embarked upon a fundamental review of those regulations and has not addressed the fundamental legal flaws within those existing regulations. What we find is that this advice to the government, through the Department of Social Security, through the first assistant secretaries of the Department of Social Security, specifies quite clearly that the present regulations for the Austudy actual means tests do not have sufficient substantive legislative backing. They could not withstand a half&hyphen;hearted legal challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Measures which lack definition on such basic concepts as savings, expenditure or actual means are all contained in the current regulations which this government must take complete ownership of since they are the ones that have introduced the new arrangements. They are the ones that have coverage for the administration of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find particularly disturbing is not just that this bungle, this extraordinary inept attitude that has been taken by this government in the administration of this scheme, is costing a small fortune. Some $640,000 to date has been expended on this bungled scheme that the minister had to revise through her announcement on 20 February. The more fundamental question is the extraordinary contemptuous attitude that the government are trying to develop. They are trying to incite the most hostile and negative attitude towards social security and Austudy recipients that could possibly be imagined. They are trying to suggest that people are getting things that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1189"> they are not entitled to, that somehow or another we should frown upon millionaires receiving welfare, as if it was the case that all recipients were somehow or another illegitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party acknowledge that there is a very fine line between those getting benefit who are entitled to it and those who are not. We suggest that there should be no mechanisms by which people abuse their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has embarked upon a revision of the actual means test in such a manner that has led to the complete bungling of that revision, so that we see some $214 million being attempted to be raised through government budget measures affecting some 71,000 applicants for Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a process which this government has embarked upon without proper recourse to thorough advice which was available to it. We have discovered that on 1 November the legal and legislative branch produced a scathing critique. That advice was made available to the office of DEETYA on 11 November last year. That advice was discussed at SES officer level. In the government's review of these proceedings of the Austudy regulations which led to the announcements of 20 February, that advice was not considered. There was, quite clearly, legal advice available that the present regime would not withstand even a half&hyphen;hearted challenge, and that advice was not considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation now where this government has had legal advice. The secretary to the department was not apparently availed of that advice until the very day of the estimates hearing. When asked whether this was an appropriate mechanism by which responsible officers should conduct proper relations within the government, Secretary Sedgwick replied that he regarded this as not best practice. He said the reason for that was the pressure of work. Isn't it extraordinary that budget measures involving $214 million and 71,000 people are not properly considered within this government!</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy President, I think it is time Senator Carr got on to some of the real issues, because people are not interested in this issue. Senator Carr, I think they see the rank hypocrisy in the Labor Party on this issue, because, for 13 months, you mucked up Austudy. You mucked it up to such an extent that in 1994 there was a report from the Ombudsman pointing out 15 major flaws with the scheme that you were administering. Interestingly enough, the major flaw related to the actual way in which you were calculating who was eligible through the tax system, and for years you did not change it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence in the hearings right around Australia about the fact that people were getting Austudy that should not have been getting it, and the evidence was so overwhelming that even you, towards the end, in the last gasps of your government, saw the need for change. In the last days of your government, a system was brought in for a broader way of determining who was eligible for this means test. So you set up this system initially. If you recall, in that first year of operation, it was not working particularly brilliantly. We certainly remember that. And it has obviously needed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1190"> to go through a few refinements.

They quickly identified the source of the problem, they quickly fixed it and they brought on a new system which meant that people who had missed out on Austudy did get it very quickly.

We very quickly recognised the disadvantage that was taking place. The minister moved in and fixed that problem in a very short period, and I think she is to be commended for an excellent effort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to take note of the answer from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). I want to concentrate on the real issues at stake in the question, and the answer that she gave, because, unlike Senator Tierney, I think it is an important policy issue. I do not know which papers he has not been reading but there has clearly been quite a deal of press coverage of the issue and that is because there are very serious problems at stake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to concentrate on the specifics of the issue rather than the actual Austudy means test. What concerns me most, having sat through the estimates hearings, is the evidence that, effectively, on 11 November 1996, the government received scathing advice which said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the regime will not stand up to scrutiny and will require substantial revision. In the first instance, the regulations are both incorrect and grossly inadequate. Furthermore, the policy underpinning the regime is inconsistent and open to attack for being inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 11 November 1996, that issue was raised inside the Department of Social Security at senior officer level. What concerns me is that the Department of Social Security has had that legal advice for three months and has failed to do anything about it. It seems it has failed to take it seriously and has not put in place any measures to act on that very serious advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone comes in here today and tries to make a virtue of saying sorry, and that is what happened at the estimates committee as well. But quite frankly, saying sorry over and over again is not enough. Someone has to be accountable for the clear stuff&hyphen;ups that are occurring inside her portfolio areas and, it seems, under those of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, as well. Minister Newman indicated that she requested material on this problem some months earlier but, again, seems to have failed to have done anything with it when she received it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Secretary of DEETYA, when he came before the estimates committee, said that the first he had heard of the problem was that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1191"> day, 26 February. It just so happened that the Labor opposition asked a question of Senator Newman at question time on that morning about this legal advice that had been floating around both departments for three months. Apparently that is the first time the Secretary to DEETYA had heard about that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if this is an obscure issue. The question of the actual means test for Austudy had been in the press quite a bit. There had been a deal of concern about what had been going on. In the department's estimates evidence they indicated that they had received complaints from 190 MPs. I have to point out that I was not one of them. I do not bother writing to Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But clearly, this was a very important issue. There was a lot of concern in the community and so this was a hot topic inside both departments. What they are saying is that the standard of government administration and the standard of cabinet relationships are such that, when you have first assistant secretaries of one department providing advice that says the whole means test is subject to challenge and cannot successfully withstand a legal challenge, no&hyphen;one does anything about it. Senior officers do not bring it to the attention of the minister, they do not bring it to the attention of the secretary to the department, and it is just left in the ether. It is just left there as a bit of a secret among some senior officers of both departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, someone has to be held accountable for this sort of administration. If is not the minister, I want to hear from the minister whose head has rolled. I know a lot of people have left the minister's department but I gather that was because they could not work with her. But surely somebody has to be held accountable for the fact that, for three months, this very serious legal advice from the legal department of Social Security provided a very serious criticism of the basis of this means test, and nothing was done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first time that the Secretary of DEETYA says he heard about it is on the afternoon after we raised it in parliament. We have to ask: what is going on between Senator Newman and Senator Vanstone that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> communication on this issue did not occur? As I said before, this is an issue that they were receiving thousands of complaints about. It was on the front page of all the newspapers and yet somehow the ministers were not briefed that there was serious concern inside the department about the whole underpinnings of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am incredulous. Either someone is telling fibs or there is a major problem inside both these departments about the way they are administered and about the way reporting occurs to senior officers and the minister. Someone has to be held accountable. Saying sorry is not good enough; you cannot just keep saying sorry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats raised the issue of the operation of the actual means test in late November and early December last year. The actions of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), contrary to Senator Tierney's claims in this place, were not swift. The department did not act quickly. As has been evidenced today&mdash;but which also came to light prior to estimates hearings and was discussed in some detail at the estimates committee last week&mdash;the social security department also raised questions regarding the operation of the AMT and whether or not it would stand up to legal and other scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the government and the minister have acted very tardily in this case. If the minister had wanted to act quickly, she would have revised the scheme or at least investigated it in January of this year. That is when some of the worst cases first came to light and it is also when the first enrolment offers went out through universities and other institutions. Instead, she waited until the third round of enrolment offers to act on this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make clear again that the Democrats certainly do not measure the success or otherwise of this issue in column inches, as per Senator Tierney's suggestion. We actually measure the effect of the operation of the actual means test in people's lives, in the human costs. May I remind the Senate that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1192"> this has meant costs in a human sense. There have been aspiring students, both secondary and tertiary students, who have dropped out of their studies as a consequence of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the minister that in fact the AMT that is in operation is a modification of that which was operating during the period of the former Labor government. The Labor government had its own problems with the AMT and its operation and they were at least reviewed and acted upon. But there was a recognition that there were problems surrounding the scheme. What we call on the minister and her government again to do is to review the AMT and make public those particular guidelines reviewing the operations of the AMT and the Austudy guidelines, that particular chapter which the department again at estimates&mdash;</PARA>

We also call on this government to reconvene the Austudy references committee with a view to not only reviewing the AMT, but actually putting some fairer suggestions in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major modification that has taken place to the Austudy actual means test has been the selection of the ABS figures used for imputation. The buck stops with the minister, whether it was someone in her department, as was veiledly indicated at estimates last week, or whether it was the minister herself who chose those unnecessarily harsh figures used for the imputation of the actual means test. They should be shamed because it was the choice of those harsh figures that ensured that many students and families were unable to access the Austudy benefits to which they were entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again raise the point that Senator Carr alluded to in this place about the myth that millionaires are accessing Austudy and that the system is being rorted when we know&mdash;and I reiterate&mdash;that these people are living on 35 per cent of the poverty line. That is what the average Austudy recipient is living on. An independent Austudy recipient&mdash;of which there are comparatively few because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the eligibility criteria are so stringent&mdash;lives on 65 per cent of the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this debate has to be continued and reviewed and we need to get answers is because now we hear that the cabinet is considering a proposal to extend the operation of the actual means test to the proposed common youth allowance. Certainly in this place today Senator Newman talked about comparatively wide analyses and consultation with various groups. Those groups are saying the same thing, and that is that there be no AMT and certainly not of this variety. They are asking the government to make it a living wage for young people in this country and not entertain the ideas that were canvassed in the paper on the weekend, that is, reducing the amount that people can earn while on Austudy from something like $6,000 per annum to around $30 a week, which I understand is what has been considered by cabinet. All of those things attack young people, students, families and the so&hyphen;called work ethic to which this government is particularly committed, or so it claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From go to whoa, the Austudy assets test and means testing has been a debacle&mdash;from a hot line that did not work and was not staffed properly, right through to a measure that knocked 90,000 students this year off benefits and saved this government a paltry $60 million. I ask the minister: at what cost?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we had sent the review forms prior to the Government's apology for the mess, and were now getting confusing information from Austudy about whether or not we had to fill in a new form, I again contacted Austudy by letter, and received a phone call from Canberra the next day (Wed. 26th) The advice was that they had made another mistake and that Kim's Austudy would now be changed again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon.

Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, disability pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 475.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a matter of urgency. This is something that the Senate needs to deal with today. We have a situation where a constitutional vandal in Queensland, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge&mdash;right in the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen mould&mdash;has publicly debauched the constitution and, I might say, has done so in the true tradition of the Queensland Nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Borbidge has, over the past couple of days, indicated, firstly, that Senator Colston may resign; and, secondly, that if he does, he would consider filling that vacancy with an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1200"> Independent or, on the other hand, he may consider delaying an appointment, appointing someone who does not have the confidence of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland or reappointing Senator Colston. That is what the Premier of Queensland has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent that the Senate today deal with this issue. Do not fall for this trick of declaring it formal, because these people, the coalition government, are going to oppose this motion. We have a situation where, if there is a vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Colston, clearly, under the spirit and the letter of section 15 of Australia's constitution, the vacancy in the position must be filled by a candidate who is endorsed by and has the confidence of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where Senator Colston, when he was elected to this place, was elected by the Labor voters in Queensland. It is Labor voters in Queensland who had faith and confidence in Senator Colston and it is the Labor voters in Queensland who have had demonstrated to them that Senator Colston was not worthy of that confidence or loyalty. It is Senator Colston who has shown absolute treachery to the party to which he belonged and to the Labor voters who selected him to represent them and the Australian Labor Party in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something which the federal government can deal with. This is something that is within Mr Howard's and Senator Hill's gift and capacity to deal with. If Senator Colston resigns, then the coalition government can pair that vacancy if Mr Borbidge decides to rip up the constitution. We simply do not accept the word of the Liberals or the federal government on this. We will not accept their word on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, of course, always keeps its word, always honours the conventions of this place and always honours the procedures of this place. But I am afraid that our impeccable standards are not reflected on the other side of the chamber. We will not accept your word. We want your commitment in black and white to this principle of pairing this vacancy. We want it in black and white.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want you to put your money where your mouth is on this issue. It is an open and shut case and it is within the gift of this government to demonstrate that they have the same commitment as the Australian Labor Party to protecting the constitution and to ensuring that the spirit and the letter of the Australian constitution is honoured. There is only one way to do that and that is to vote for this suspension of standing orders, vote for the motion before the Senate and do it now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has it got to do with section 15 of the constitution? Absolutely nothing. It is not a motion about section 15 of the constitution. In any event, we are on the record as saying&mdash;I said it in question time yesterday&mdash;that section 15 is clear and unambiguous. We accept the 1977 amendments. We accept that, when there is a casual vacancy, a state government has to appoint someone from the party of the person who created the vacancy as at the time of the last election. We accept it. So this motion is not about the spirit of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on the record as saying that that would depend upon the time. But if you are talking about a period of a year or two then it would not be within the spirit, in my view, of the constitution to delay an appointment for that time. So this is not about that. It is not about urgency, because nothing flows from this motion at all today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it is about is to take a five-minute opportunity in this place to sledge Senator Colston because he deserted, in their view, the Labor Party. It is not to look at the circumstances by which he resigned from the Labor Party that might have justified that course of action. According to the Labor Party he must be punished because if he isn't adequately punished how can they maintain discipline over others? That is what this is all about.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me relate it directly back. As I have indicated, on three occasions since the coalition has come to government we have indicated in circumstances where there was a vacancy or a potential vacancy that we would offer pairs. What we are starting to wonder about in terms of Mr Borbidge's statement on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program is whether all conventions are going to be thrown out. That is why it is urgent we discuss it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chamber operates on two bases: the first is standing orders; the second is convention and accepted practice. If it is good enough, just for opportunistic reasons, for the coalition to go down the opportunistic road and say, `Oh, hold on. We're not going to offer pairs in future when these circumstances occur,' it should be sorted out today so we all know the ground rules. We know how often the coalition break convention, break rules, in their pursuit of power. Their sense of decency simply does not exist on these issues. We know from negotiations in this chamber, when we negotiate the future of how this chamber will operate, that suddenly it disappears. In 1983, we granted pairs for a deputy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1203"> president's vote. What happens 13 years later? `Oh, no. Sorry. You don't get pairs in reciprocation,' even though we had signed the sheet on the pairs situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the will of the Senate comes in. We have had this debate seven times before. When crucial coalition members miss divisions that can change the total outcome of legislation, we on this side of the chamber have always granted a re&hyphen;vote. On the one occasion that it happened on the other side, they forced us to go through 12 divisions&mdash;12 divisions that you well remember, Madam President, because it was only through your graciousness and wit that it was resolved. Twelve divisions to rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency of this, for Senator Harradine and anyone else, is that we want to know what the ground rules are in future. We want to know whether, if we play by the rules and we play by convention, it is going to be reciprocated, or whether we are going to have a new standard in politics in this country where we are the bunnies playing by the rules and where, at the first opportunity that the coalition have, they will rip us up; they will not obey those conventions. It is urgent that we settle this now so that future relationships in this chamber can be established on a basis of commonsense and decency. This has become urgent now because we have seen from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>interview with Mr Borbidge that he has no conception, no conception at all, of the conventions and political principle. I think one journalist put it very aptly: either Mr Borbidge is very stupid or he is getting very poor advice to say what he said last weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other point I want to make is in response to Senator Hill. He says that we are persecuting a senator. The fact is, if it is a matter of principle, there is nothing wrong with a senator resigning from a political party in this place. The crime is staying here. If you are principled and if you do believe for some reason you no longer share the philosophy and views of your party, you put a letter in to you, Madam President. You resign from this chamber and you go. You do not stay here for grubby venal reasons. You do not sell your services to the other side. That is a tradition

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about conventions of the Senate, I turn to our friends on the coalition opposition benches under Senator Kernot and move to the urgency of this motion. If Senator Kernot or any of the people opposite thought it was an urgent matter to come to a vote today, they would have allowed this matter to have gone formal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot can do what she wants, but what most people do when they pull up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and see a motion they do not quite agree with&mdash;and I suggest Senator Kernot did this to Senator Faulkner at some time in the last 24 hours; Senator Kernot can seek leave to deny what I say is true if it is not true&mdash;is say, `I suggest that, if you put in these new words, we would support that motion.' Senator Faulkner can deny that that took place. It might have taken place through officers.</PARA>

You oppose formality.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the connivance of the fourth faction of the Labor Party, with the connivance of the coalition in opposition, the Australian Democrats, Senator Faulkner ensured that this matter was not dealt with as a matter of urgency. By using a connivance that was devised, I thought fairly effectively, by Senator Brown and Senator Margetts to make sure that they could have a debate on issues, they ensured that this matter could not be dealt with urgently. By their very deeds, by their throwing out of convention and by their abuse of the standing orders here this afternoon, they have ensured that this matter cannot be dealt with urgently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Ray, to Senator Faulkner and to the leader of the Democrat faction of the coalition in opposition: do not go around saying that you stand by conventions. Do not quote my old friend Noel Crichton-Browne's name back to me, when you were the people who stopped Noel Crichton-Browne becoming Deputy President because you chucked out convention in 1993.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the urgency of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). Because of the debate we have had here today, it is quite clear to me that this is an urgent issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I became whip, there have been a number of resignations, and, unfortunately, one death of a senator. As Senator Ray has quite clearly outlined, on each of those occasions as Labor whip, I have said immediately to the government whip, `We will of course 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1205"> pair that senator for all votes from now on.' When Senator Baume decided to retire there was a great deal of interest in the press as to whether or not he would be paired. I rang John Panizza and assured him that Baume would be paired&mdash;and, when we returned to parliament, he was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reason for then Senator Baume not going quickly&mdash;and he was very keen to get to America&mdash;was that the Liberal Party were about to rat on a convention when it came to the election of the Deputy President. At that time they tried to ensure that the two Labor members&mdash;one of whom was in a sick bed in Adelaide&mdash;whom they had paired in a letter on that day would not be allowed to vote. The Liberal Party said, `Despite the letter we wrote to you concerning the pairs for today, when it comes to the vote for Deputy President, when it comes to us voting for Mal Colston and fulfilling our part of the deal, you cannot have a pair.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very suspicious of their principles on these issues because, when it came to the crunch, when their self&hyphen;interest was at stake, they tried to rat. Only after a very embarrassing debate did Senator Hill finally agree to the pairing arrangements being honoured for that vote. That was my first experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second experience was on the death of John Panizza, a man for whom I had a great deal of respect. He, as soon as he had died, was paired by the opposition. That pair arrangement has remained in existence, while the WA Liberal Party fights out its factional fights over his replacement. Until he is replaced, he will continue to be paired. In fact, he has been paired as an additional number over the five normal pairs granted because obviously the circumstances under which he departed were way beyond the Liberal Party's control. So we have again offered a pair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we come to Senator Woods. He announced his resignation. We immediately made it clear in this chamber and privately that he would be paired&mdash;and that has been the case. In fact, he has hardly been here since the announcement of that decision. But today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and this is one of the reasons for this motion being urgent&mdash;it has been reported that Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Woods feels he cannot resign because he is not sure about the pairing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pass this motion and Senator Woods can go. You can be rid of him as you want to be. He claims he cannot retire because he is not sure that pairing arrangements, as proposed by Senator Faulkner in this motion, will be honoured. Vote for this motion, and he can go. This is your chance. Let Bob Woods go. Vote for this motion, and he can go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another reason for the urgency of this motion. If you were watching the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night, you would have seen Robert Hill squirm when it was put to him, `Will you honour the pairing arrangements? Will you honour the conventions?' He squirmed. He twisted. He obfuscated. He would not give a clear answer because he knew that the coalition were considering ratting. He knew that the members of his party were weighing up their options. He knew that they were looking at the possibilities that Premier Borbidge had put to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for those reasons that there is concern and urgency. All our experience, all the evidence, is that there is something amiss here in that there is the potential for the coalition to rat. If this motion is successful, the first time it will be able to be applied will be tomorrow in relation to Senator Bob Woods. Let him resign, we will pair him, this proposed resolution will be implemented and the principle will be adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have been the beneficiaries of these arrangements for the last three resignations or deaths with the application of this principle. This proposed resolution can be as easily read in connection with Senator Woods or Senator Panizza as with Senator Colston. You do not want to argue the principle because you are toying with doing something totally immoral and totally unprincipled. But the motion goes straight to principle, and it goes to the urgency. You have a senator who wants to resign, and we want to let him go. Let us have none of the obfuscation that is occurring now. If you were really concerned about the principle involved, you would have argued that point. All you have argued is process and Noel Crichton-Browne. You are not prepared to address this because you are considering

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, the Labor Party seems to have some sole criterion when it comes to replacing or pairing senators who have, regrettably, passed away. Of course on every occasion where that has happened, every occasion, where they have been Labor Party people, the Liberal and National parties have granted pairs.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces an historic innovation to public administration in Australia with the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which was announced as part of the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Agency will be a major change in service delivery arrangements for the Commonwealth. Although it will initially encompass the full suite of income security payments and services currently provided by the Department of Social Security, together with a number of employment and child care services, it will have the potential to add to these over time. It will provide an administrative framework for integrating access to Commonwealth services by consolidating services so that, where possible, people can get the help they need in one place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's objectives in creating the Agency are to provide a much better standard of service delivery to the community and to individuals; and to increase service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The government wishes to shift the focus and direction of customer service from the mechanics of transaction and process to one which is centred on individuals and their needs. The scope of the Agency's activities will cover services to the retired, families, the unemployed, carers and widows, the short term incapacitated and people with disabilities. It will be the public presence for some of the most sensitive social responsibilities of government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes sense to consolidate services so that, where possible, people can access them in one place. For example, unemployed people will only have to go to one Agency office to seek income support rather than having to go to both DSS and CES offices respectively as at present. In this way the Agency will be a significant step to reducing the complexity of government for individuals and the community. The Agency will deliver services for a number of portfolios and integrate these into a common point of customer contact. The clear principle underlying the concept of the Agency is the government's commitment to put the needs of people for high quality service delivery above the boundaries of Commonwealth departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will be an organisation focused on, and specialising in, customer service. It will do this by simplifying and streamlining service delivery through an integrated and national network of offices. It will have a Charter, including a guarantee to customers of certain standards of service. The current DSS network of regional offices, together with its Teleservice Centres, Family Service Centres and Retirement Service Centres, will go to the Agency and form the core of its service outlets. It will also take on some offices that are now part of the CES network along with the Student Assistance Centres. The Agency will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1208"> also provide a means for integrating the existing services for some groups needing specialist assistance and continue to recognise that the arrangements for these groups of clients require sensitive and careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will be located in the Social Security portfolio, given that the largest component of its activities will be the administration of entitlements under Social Security legislation. In designing the framework for the Agency, the government has taken into account the need for ministerial involvement to ensure accountability; sufficient flexibility to allow greater capacity for innovation and improved customer service; and the need to ensure a strong partnership between policy and process design and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is a core part of government operations. All the mainstream legislation for the operation of Commonwealth departments and agencies will apply to this Agency. It will be subject to the Audit Act, Finance Regulations and Finance Directions. This reflects the fact that the Agency will not be a separate entity from the Commonwealth. The government considers that these scrutiny and accountability arrangements are central to the management structures for the Agency given that it will be responsible for the day to day administration of large sums of public monies.</PARA>

In relation to Senator Harradine's comment, the disallowance procedure in the Senate does, of course, place scrutiny on the minister's behaviour and it does have that aspect of transparency&mdash;it does have the parliamentary content in it which allows the opposition and Independents to play some part in it.

The proposition contained in the amendment is that the level of income a person must have to receive this incentive should be maintained, not that there should be a variation in the amount of the incentive. I can well understand the parliamentary secretary's proposition if what we are proposing was indexation of the actual amount of the incentive.

What I am saying is that our amendment does not have the effect of changing the amount that is actually paid to an eligible recipient. All it does is ensure that the level of income which defines the recipient remains the same in real terms. Let me give a rough example. Say the level was $100 and over time because of the effects of inflation that person's income went up to $110.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In March 1996 the number of people with private health insurance was 33.9 per cent and it is now 33.2 per cent. This participation rate has been declining over the years. In fact, over the last 15 years it has declined at an average of 0.45 per cent per quarter. It is interesting to note that, between the passing of the private health insurance bill in December 1995 and presently, that rate of decline has slightly dropped to 0.25 per cent per quarter. Obviously, it is not an end to that decline but it is a major improvement over the rate of decline prior to that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation passed in December 1995 had the stated objective of the government of reducing the rate of decline. To some extent, it has been successful. In my view, it is largely limited by the failure of private health insurance companies to be able to negotiate with doctors, and the resistance of the AMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some uncertainty in the media and in statements made by the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, about what the real objective of this package of legislation is in terms of the target of participation rates in private health insurance. A figure of 35.5 per cent was bandied around at some time. In the debate in the House of Representatives the minister tried to draw away from that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would expect that this would bottom out within 12 months of the introduction of these incentives. If that was a figure of 33 per cent, that would be reasonable.

I think you have alluded to that in your comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You noted that the rate of decline per quarter had halved during the last year. The reduction in the decline in private health insurance is due to the fact that the government has made its position very clear.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government first has to stem this flow, which even Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, said placed great pressure on the public hospitals in that state. It has been acknowledged by many people from your side of politics that the decline of private health insurance is of no value to the state of health in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees, I would suggest to you that that would only provide a bandaid solution in a very short-term situation. In  fact, the money that is being spent is designed to keep people in private health and also to attract people back to private health insurance. We are facing, as Senator Neal mentioned, a continuing loss of people from private health insurance. So you have to give them the incentive to stay there. You also have to show those people who are have left it and those other people who have hitherto not been members of it that there is some benefit in joining up. That is where the attraction of these incentives lies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do premiums continue to rise&mdash;you have no ability to cap that; you have no ability to contain costs in the private system&mdash;but people also face so many additional costs.

They know quite frequently if they go as a private patient into the public system they will get additional bills from their anaesthetist, their surgeon, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you really are keen about people looking after themselves, then why do we have before us again in this package of legislation the move to restrict people's ability, if they spend on themselves&mdash;that is, insured or uninsured&mdash;to actually claim some rebate on that? We are going to be looking&mdash;I think it is in the taxation bill as part of this package, the measure we have already rejected in this chamber&mdash;at a very popular measure only with the health insurance companies because they want further pressure on people to go back to their bad deals.</PARA>

If you get more healthy people involved in private health insurance who never have to claim&mdash;that is, after all, where the insurance funds are able to keep their premiums down; it just makes sense with the more people you have participating&mdash;there is a greater chance of keeping those premiums down, especially with the attraction of younger people, who will not be claiming as much as older people.

There is absolutely no evidence to support what you are saying&mdash;that people who are not currently insured will actually go looking for $800 or thereabouts so as to get a benefit of $125 if they are single people.

The Productivity Commission tells us that a one per cent drop costs the government, in health terms, $300,000. If you compare that amount with the $600,000 per annum that this incentive will cost this government, to me it does not add up&mdash;you save $300,000 by paying $600,000.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will speak to this Democrat amendment briefly. We have canvassed some of these issues. Our amendment inserts into the bill a sunset clause and basically says that, if there is not a three per cent increase in the number of people holding appropriate private health insurance cover by the year 2000, the act will cease to have effect. When we are putting in $1.7 billion, three per cent is surely the minimum to expect, given what the minister in the other place has said and what a variety of people have said whose opinions were sought. Some opinions say five per cent and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> others say it should be a six per cent increase. We are putting it at only a three per cent increase and we are saying that if by the year 2000 this has not succeeded&mdash;in other words, if $1.7 billion has basically gone down the drain&mdash;we should pull the plug on it and we will have learned the lesson. We should then at least put this whole issue back before this chamber and not continue with something which has not been successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary said, I think, that $1.7 billion is a bandaid as far as the public system is concerned and it would not last very much time at all. With due respect, I say to him that, say, $500 million a year could make an enormous difference to our public system. To begin with, if we had a spare $100 million to put into our public hospitals, we could look at some active intervention to reduce waiting times; at a capital works program for some of our older hospitals; at a technology acquisition program; and at some difficulties the hospitals are having with administration thanks to the new casemix system. One hundred million dollars a year would put our dental services back in place. One hundred million dollars into Aboriginal health, directed through community health services, would make an enormous difference. In rural health, the minimum suggested if we really are serious about providing rural Australians with adequate health is about $60 million for community and health support services in rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for mental health, my home state, South Australia, for example, is basically divided in two for child and adolescent mental health services. Just to give you an example of how far money has to stretch, the northern half&mdash;everything north of Adelaide and out to the west as far as the West Australian border&mdash;is running on a budget of $300,000 a year. As I think I said in this place yesterday when I was looking at the mental health issue, young people in Whyalla who are assessed as in urgent need of support and help have a 14&hyphen;month wait, even if they are suicidal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I suggest, Minister, that $1.7 billion is an enormous amount of money in terms of what could be done in the public system, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1224"> therefore if by the year 2000 this measure has not turned around, as you suggest it will, the rate of those who are insured and has not put it up by three per cent, we really are wasting our money. We should then bring it back before this chamber and reassess it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Lees for giving us notice of the amendment put forward by the Democrats. The government will oppose this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objection by the government is based on both policy and technicality. A sunset clause was not contained in the government's policy when it went to the people in March last year. We undertook to make this an ongoing arrangement with a view to putting the vital floor beneath private health insurance membership. As the minister (Mr Wooldridge) has stated repeatedly, the government is optimistic about the package boosting performance. Certainly, our forward estimates make assumptions about a modest increase in membership over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a question of policy, we have made an ongoing commitment to the people of Australia. It is not just on a suck it and see basis. As far as the technical aspects go, when you look at the bill you will see that appropriate private health cover has three possible forms&mdash;that is, hospital cover only, ancillary cover only or both. Senator Lees's amendment does not seem to make these distinctions, although I would understand that it does imply hospital cover, which is the focus of the quarterly figures in the public mind. Is that what you are saying, Senator Lees?</PARA>

Certainly, the questioning this evening would indicate that I am a little bit puzzled by the failure of the government to have any real objectives in terms of expenditure of this size&mdash;$1.7 billion over three years. By the same token, we are very aware of the difficulty of declining membership in private health insurance and we would not want to be put in a position where it could be said that the introduction of a sunset clause would mean that the problem was unable to be resolved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment removes those provisions which set up a surcharge for high income earners and replaces them with a more progressive levy for all high income earners. What we have done basically is remove the penalty aspects of the surcharge arguing that we do indeed need more money in the public health system. As I said in my speech on the second reading, we should not impose a penalty on people because they choose not to purchase a particular product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is a great one for extolling the virtues of the marketplace and here we have the government saying, `Sorry, we cannot let the marketplace operate this time because we do not like the results. We do not like the way in which the market is working.' The market is actually choosing not to buy something that they see as bad value. What we are arguing is that we simply should have a progressive regime put in place so that high income earners progressively pay more towards the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment will mean that persons on a taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000 will pay an additional half a per cent in their Medicare levy, persons on a taxable income from $75,000 up to $100,000 will pay an additional 0.8 per cent and persons on a taxable income over $100,000 a year will pay an additional one per cent. This is going to raise, on our estimates, around $360 million a year. As I showed earlier, we could easily put $500 million a year into our public health

This is what we began to talk about in the first bill but did not continue with as we wished to deal with these bills one after the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the parliamentary secretary that his package, together with this bill, makes a nonsense of what he has been saying about taking the pressure off the public system. Effectively what you are doing with this particular measure in this tax bill is limiting choice. You are saying to people, `We will support you only if you buy your product through specific funds. You cannot go out and choose another fund. You cannot choose to privately insure yourself.' In other words, you cannot put the money aside in your own account and use it as your family needs it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to some of the original reasons why this $1,000&mdash;or in earlier times a lesser amount&mdash;was put in place. It was put in place for those people who have chronic illness, for those families who have one or perhaps more members with a disability. Certainly, by very definition, it was put in place to give additional support to those families who have higher medical expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to look at the additional costs that come with insurance. Let me go back to those companies this government is approving of and those companies it wants to see people investing in. One of the reasons people do not declare private health insurance is that they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1231"> are going to get all these additional bills. In a way, this amendment is working against the rest of the package. In many private hospitals you will get an additional bill for the surgeon, the anaesthetist, perhaps the bed itself and ancillary services. When people accrued $1,000 worth of expenses, they were able to get some relief. For a whole range of reasons, this is working against choice, which is surely what the rest of the package is about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a question of the parliamentary secretary in relation to this matter. The government's objective is to encourage persons to self&hyphen;insure with registered funds. It is absolutely essential that, if the government's objective is to be achieved, the registered funds get their act together. With the government intending that the rebate threshold be lifted from $1,000 to $1,500, in my view surely this must reduce pressure on the health insurers to compete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that a 50 per cent increase is a bit steep, because one does not benefit from unreimbursed expenses. They are expenses, by definition, not covered by insurance. As has been said previously, this particular threshold was originally put in there for those families that do have additional expenses, either because of dependants or because they do not happen to have good health. I cannot for the life of me see why it has been increased. There has been no argument put forward by the government as to why it has been increased, except to say that it has not been increased for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Am I correct in assuming that when the threshold was first fixed at $1,000, any expenditure above that was able to be claimed at about 30 per cent?

You would still have received a bill at the end of your care. You would be able to claim the out-of-pocket expenses as a rebate, notwithstanding the fact that you were privately insured.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you are not privately insured, the amount available for rebate is much greater because it is the net amount that is available for the rebate. So if you have more people on private health insurance, there will be an amount that is available to be calculated for the rebate, but it will be a much lesser amount. And, of course, you have to qualify for the rebate. So it may be that the excess paid by someone who goes to hospital two or three times in a year would not be a sufficient amount to claim the rebate. But if they did not have private health insurance, they could avail themselves of the rebate perhaps quite easily. That is where the lesser participation in private health insurance results in a greater claim in the rebate, as I mentioned to Senator Lees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to refer to an article, which was in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  on Sunday, 2 March, under the heading `Blainey attacks Mabo case judges'. That article refers both to the comments of Professor Geoffrey Blainey in his address to the Sir Arthur Fadden memorial dinner last Friday night in Townsville and to comments by the Queensland Premier, Mr Rob Borbidge, who has referred to comments made in that speech. It is incredible that Professor Blainey, if the article correctly reports him, is prepared to make comments which seem to me to trivialise the history of Australia and particularly the history of the Aboriginal population in Australia. The article says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a stinging attack on the High Court, Professor Blainey told the inaugural Sir Arthur Fadden Memorial Dinner at Townsville on Friday night that Sir William&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to Sir William Deane&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and another High Court judge, whom he did not name, had deplorably misused history to back their decisions on Mabo legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the judges had turned political and accused whites of the wholesale massacre of Aborigines when most had died of diseases inadvertently spread by Europeans. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to that, Professor Geoffrey Blainey and a number of other historians have published their views on Australian history. I have taken the opportunity to look at some of those views, particularly with regard to the history of the decline in the Aboriginal population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the greater part of the 19th century, a reduction from approximately 300,000 to about 50,000 occurred and nowhere in the history can it be said that that reduction&mdash;in terms of the numbers, from 300,000 to 50,000&mdash;was due to the massacre or the direct killing of the Aboriginal population by the new settlers. In fact, figures of between 10,000 and 20,000 have been put forward as reasonable guesstimates of the number of Aboriginals who were killed in skirmishes, either official or unofficial, between settlers or between organised military activities on behalf of the colonists. So there was obviously a decline in the population of about 250,000, and less than 10 per cent of that was due to the direct killing of the population by the settlers in organised or disorganised fashions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Other Side of the Frontier</EMPHASIS> by Professor Henry Reynolds there is reference not only to the issue of the disease which had an impact upon the population but also to the issue of the fall in the birthrate in that population. I want to refer to that passage from that work because it is very unfortunate that we have a debate in the community at the moment which is very superficial and which is not really addressing the issues of the cause of the decline in the population. We will not address this in a manner which will be illuminating to the Australian population if we rely upon articles such as the one published last Sunday that I am referring to. Professor Reynolds said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The catastrophic fall in the birth rate was another factor of demographic significance. Aborigines not only died at unprecedented rates; they were not born, or did not survive childhood, in anything like sufficient numbers to replace the loss by premature death. `A child is now but rarely to be met with', wrote a white official in melancholy mood, `a birth but seldom known'. The missionary Benjamin Hurst commented in 1841 that he knew of only two children under twelve within a forty mile radius of his station on the western side of Port Phillip Bay. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1236"> A settler at Lake Colac noted that amongst one hundred or so local women there had been no more than six or eight children born in the previous three years. A contemporary could recall only two births in five years in his district and both children later died. William Thomas kept detailed records of the Port Phillip and Western Port clans. Between 1848 and 1858 the population fell from 92 to 56 and only one child survived. The story was similar all over the continent. In district after district children were found to be `few beyond all proportion'. Many of the factors&mdash;malnutrition, exposure, disease and especially V.D. in a variety of forms&mdash;were only too apparent. But beyond even their lethal reach there was the loss of land, the dislocation of the known universe, a previous unthinkable disruption of the cosmic cycle of birth and death and reincarnation. Some groups exhibited an unquenchable determination to survive; for others the onslaught of invasion had destroyed everything. The future itself had been extinguished. Death from disease and chronic infant mortality merely proved that the times were irrecoverably out of joint. The Port Phillip Protectors reported Aboriginal comments eloquent with despair, leached of all hope. Thomas referred to `this indifference to prolong their race, on the ground as they state of having no country they can call their own'. `No country, no good have it pickaninnys', one Aborigine explained, while another lamented `no country now for them . . . and no more come up pickaninny'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, in the middle of the last century, the issue of land as related to the survival of Aborigines was one which had been noted by the then historians. Referring back to the reported comments of Geoffrey Blainey, it would be more appropriate if, rather than relying upon a recitation of history which suits slogans such as `Black armband history', Professor Blainey were more responsible and had more regard to the real history of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, when I grew up in the 1950s, we were not taught at school about the real history of Australia. I think that is a comment which applies to most of the Australians who grew up in the early postwar period. I think it is not surprising that there are a lot of people out there who have not been made aware of the real history; people to whom the prejudiced logic&mdash;in my view&mdash;of some of the opponents of Aboriginal land rights has an appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in the article there is a quote from the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> makes reference to Professor Blainey's address at the Sir Arthur Fadden memorial dinner. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of land tenure based on race is racist. The High Court has made itself political. Mr Blainey's speech went to the heart of the dilemma facing this country over the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, that is consistent with what is reported to have been Professor Blainey's attack on the Mabo decision and the native title legislation. But I think that is quite an unfair assertion. The basis of the Mabo decision and the native title legislation which followed it is that there must have been long&hyphen;term occupancy. Most European land tenure has a lot to do with long&hyphen;term occupancy; it is nothing to do with race. But, in the case of Eddie Mabo and in the case of the native title legislation, the long&hyphen;term occupants were Aboriginal, so it is unremarkable that their right to title relates to their race. There were no other occupants here prior to European settlement. It is an irrelevancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept is not based on race; it is, in fact, based on long&hyphen;term occupancy of this country, just as most European land title is based on long&hyphen;term occupancy. It would be equally flawed to say that the French, the English or the German land tenure systems were based upon race. They are equally based on long&hyphen;term occupancy. I would suggest that Premier Borbidge and Professor Blainey have a good close look at the logic of their statements before they make such inflammatory statements to the Australian population.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.20 p.m." PAGE="1236"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.20 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The FAC operates under the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 which allows the FAC to make by&hyphen;laws not inconsistent with the Act or the regulations, for liquor and gambling (under s72(1)(p) and (q)).

The State Government agreed with the final position. In fact, the SA Gaming Law was changed after the agreement was put in place (in the tavern lease and authority documents) and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before the tavern opened (amendment effective from 1 July 1996) so the FAC entered into a deed of variation with its tenant to directly reflect these changes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australia Government supports international and regional efforts to bring the conflict in Sudan to an end. We hope Sudan will join with other regional parties in finding lasting solutions to the region's social, political and economic problems. Both the UN and Australia have urged the Government of Sudan to commit itself to participate in negotiations sponsored by the Inter&hyphen;Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). Only a multilateral solution such as proposed by the IGAD is likely to end the war. It is disappointing that peace negotiations mediated by the IGAD have so far made little tangible process. The IGAD forum, nevertheless, has the potential to be an effective avenue for the promotion and coordination of regional peace and stability, and for the realisation of sustainable economic and social development. For the IGAD to be successful in bringing peace to Sudan, there must be greater involvement and commitment on the part of all IGAD members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There are no flights operating between the United States and Sudan and no sanctions at this stage on flights between the two countries. United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1070 of 16 August 1996 calls on States to deny aircraft permission to take off from, land in, or overfly their territories if the aircraft is registered in Sudan, or owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of Sudan Airways, or by or on behalf of the Government or public authorities of Sudan. The date for the implementation of this air embargo is yet to be determined by the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has imposed entry and transit restrictions on members and officials of the Sudanese Government and Sudanese armed forces personnel as required by UNSCR 1054. UNSCR 1054 requires all States to: (a) significantly reduce the number and the level of the staff at Sudanese diplomatic missions and consular posts 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and restrict or control the movement within their territory of all such staff who remain; and (b) take steps to restrict the entry into or transit through their territory of members of the Government of Sudan, officials of the Government and members of the armed forces. There are no Sudanese diplomatic or consular posts in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sanctions set out in UNSCR 1054 arose out of Sudan's failure to fulfil the undertakings of UNSCR 1044 which demands the extradition of three suspects in connection with the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Mubarak and that Sudan cease activities which support terrorism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) As members of the United Nations, Australia and the United States are implementing relevant Security Council resolutions relevant to Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Australian Government will move to impose the air embargo contained in UNSCR 1070 when, and if, an implementation date is agreed by the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government continues to support international and regional efforts to bring the civil war in Sudan to an end and considers the best avenue for achieving peace in Sudan to be through the Inter&hyphen;Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The IGAD forum is probably the most promising avenue for the promotion of regional peace and stability, and for the realisation of sustainable economic and social development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is also concerned about repeated allegations of human rights abuses in Sudan. Our views regarding such abuses are conveyed to the Government of Sudan through bilateral channels, as well as multilateral forums. Our Ambassador in Cairo, who is accredited to Khartoum, makes bilateral representations to the Sudanese Government on individual cases as well as the human rights situation in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Australia continues to speak out about the human rights situation in Sudan in the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. The Australian Government has actively supported efforts by the UN to monitor the situation in Sudan and to apply pressure on the Government of Sudan to abide by its human rights obligations. Australia co&hyphen;sponsored resolutions on Sudan at the 52nd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the 51st session of the UN General Assembly. The resolutions expressed deep concern at reports of religious persecution and slavery in Sudan and urged greater cooperation by the Sudanese Government with the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Sudan, with international agencies, humanitarian organisations and donor governments. The resolutions also call on the Government of Sudan to cease immediately all

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The Government has been advised that the general route of the Pacific Teal will be around the Cape of Good Hope, then south of Australia and through the Southwest Pacific to Japan. The exact route will be determined by the ship's captain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Pacific Teal left Cherbourg, France on 13 January 1997. It is expected to arrive in Japan in mid&hyphen;March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) (i) The ship is expected to be in Australia's vicinity throughout the second half of February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) As for (1)(c)(i) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) This is a matter for the ship's captain to determine, in accordance with the right of freedom of navigation under international law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) As the exact route of the shipment will be determined by the ship's captain, it is not possible to provide an answer to this question, beyond stating that the Australian Government has been given assurances by the Japanese, French and British Governments that the planned route of the Pacific Teal will not entail passage through Australia's territorial waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government has been advised that no port visits are scheduled during the voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The waste being carried by the Pacific Teal is high&hyphen;level radioactive waste (HLW), consisting of mixed fission products resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The waste is in a vitrified form which, along with the highly engineered packaging, ensures a high degree of retention of the radioactive contents even in the worst accident conditions. The waste contains no recoverable plutonium or uranium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No specific investigation has been carried out in relation to the current shipment. As noted in the answer to question (8)(a) below, the Australian Government has received assurances from the Japanese, French and British Governments, which together are responsible for the shipment, that the shipment is in accordance with the relevant international standards. Appropriate arrangements, involving a number of Government Departments and Agencies including the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, are in place to coordinate an Australian response to maritime emergencies, including any emergency involving the Pacific Teal in Australia's area of responsibility for maritime search and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1241"> rescue. Such arrangements would be activated promptly if an emergency arose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Australian Government has no reason to believe that the current shipment does not conform to the safety standards prescribed in the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Regulations for the Safe Transport of Nuclear Material. In that regard, the New Zealand Government has not questioned the adequacy of the regulations: its concerns in relation to the standards for the transportation of radioactive waste by sea relate primarily to two areas&mdash;the International Maritime Organisation's Irradiated Nuclear Fuels Code (the INF Code, which draws on and is complementary to the IAEA regulations), and civil liability for nuclear damage. In the case of the INF Code, New Zealand has called for greater transparency and consultation with coastal states on routes, and for the code to be made mandatory. Australia supports calls for transparency and consultation, within the limits of safety and security, and is satisfied with efforts made by Japan, France and the UK in relation to the current shipment. Australia has also supported, in principle, calls for the INF Code to be made mandatory, although the full implications of this proposal are still being examined. On liability, New Zealand and Australia are contributing to the work of the IAEA's Standing Committee on Nuclear Liability, to establish a world&hyphen;wide liability regime to supplement and enhance the measures in the Vienna and Paris Conventions, as well as in relevant national legislation, on compensation for nuclear damage, with a view to increasing the amount of compensation for nuclear damage, including transboundary damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) As noted in the answer to question (5) above, the New Zealand Government has not put forward any proposals in relation to the IAEA's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Nuclear Material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) See (6)(a) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The IAEA's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Nuclear Material have been in existence since 1961 and have been regularly reviewed and revised. Australia supports efforts to refine the regulations, and is active in the IAEA Transport Safety Standards Advisory Committee, which is charged with producing and updating IAEA transport standards and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (a) Reports have come to our notice that a number of countries have expressed varying degrees of concern about the current shipment. In our region these include the Cook Islands, Fiji, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vanuatu. The South Pacific Forum Secretariat has reiterated the Forum's concern over the shipment of high&hyphen;level nuclear and other hazardous wastes through the South Pacific Region. Malaysia, New Zealand and Vanuatu have each sought assurances on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> possible passage of the Pacific Teal through their exclusive economic zones, as has Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Several countries in Latin America also expressed concern about the shipment when it was thought possible that the ship would travel via Cape Horn or the Panama Canal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Australian Government believes it is important that<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS> the shipment be made in accordance with the appropriate, internationally&hyphen;accepted safety standards. The Government accepts the right of freedom of navigation through the exclusive economic zones of states, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) The Australian Government has made numerous representations to ensure that arrangements for the shipment of radioactive waste, as with any hazardous waste, meet acceptable standards. Australia has consistently joined with other South Pacific Forum countries in expressing concern that shipments of radioactive waste through our region be made in accordance with the highest international safety and security standards, in a manner which satisfactorily addresses all possible contingencies, and in full consultation with Forum countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian authorities, including the Nuclear Safety Bureau (NSB) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) have confidence in the International Atomic Energy Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Nuclear Material, which are internationally agreed and regularly revised. Australia has received assurances from the Japanese, French and British Governments that the current shipment is in accordance with these standards and indeed in some respects exceeds them. The Government is therefore satisfied that the radiological protection and safety arrangements for shipments to Japan meet or exceed all of the relevant international standards, and that the shipments do not pose any serious health or environmental threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia accepts that international law grants states a right of freedom of navigation of their ships on the high seas or through states' exclusive economic zones, and the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of coastal states. We also accept Japan's right to make sovereign choices about its energy mix, just as Australia expects to be left to decide how to meet its own power generation requirements. The transport by sea of HLW is a function of the industrial and contractual arrangements established under Japan's nuclear power program; it is also consistent with the widely&hyphen;accepted principle that countries look after their own waste material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Government would not have grounds for legally opposing the shipment of HLW to Japan. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Australia is party, grants states a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1242"> right of freedom of navigation for their ships on the high seas or through other states' exclusive economic zones. The Convention also grants states the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of coastal states, with ships carrying nuclear material being allowed passage provided they "carry documents and observe special precautionary measures established for such ships by international agreements".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) (a) The HLW contains no nuclear material which, in the terminology of our bilateral safeguards agreements, is Australian&hyphen;obligated nuclear material (AONM). This is because safeguards are terminated on HLW when it is processed into a form where the minute amounts of remnant nuclear material it contains are no longer practically recoverable. Our various bilateral agreements provide that bilateral safeguards terminate when IAEA safeguards terminate. Thus the HLW contains no nuclear material which is any longer subject to bilateral safeguards or identifiable by national safeguards obligation. Since, however, the waste material is derived from the reprocessing of spent fuel comprised in part of AONM, it can be assumed to contain minute amounts of remnant material similarly derived, although not recognizably Australian. Since this remnant material is no longer of safeguards interest there is no requirement for it to be the subject of further safeguards accounting under our bilateral safeguards agreements.</PARA>
