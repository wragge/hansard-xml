<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the act) to create a new class of licence&mdash;a temporary community broadcasting licence. The legislation will empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to allocate the licences for a maximum period of one year without recourse to the act's planning provisions. The bill also provides for consequential amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to enable the new Australian Communications Authority to issue transmitter licences to these licensees.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No provision exists under the act for temporary community broadcasting licences. The ABA has, instead, provided for test transmissions of 90 days per aspirant per year, by making spectrum available to providers of open narrowcasting services, and issuing temporary apparatus licences, a power delegated to it under the Radiocommunications Act. The situation is far from satisfactory. The ABA has not been able to impose conditions that apply to community broadcasting licensees, for example, community access provisions, and sponsorship announcements limited to four minutes per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Test transmissions have done much to foster the overall development of the community broadcasting sector. There are currently over 140 aspirant community broadcasters seeking a long&hyphen;term licence. But limited periods of test transmission have meant that it has become increasingly difficult for these non&hyphen;profit aspirants to maintain support from volunteers, sponsors and the local community. Some aspirants may be forced to disband before the ABA has completed the planning process, and allocated long&hyphen;term licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that Honourable Senators from both sides of the Senate have registered growing concern at the delays in the planning and allocation process. The ABA expects that Licence Area Planning will not be completed before 1999&mdash;a three and a half year slippage. Many markets have no long&hyphen;term community broadcasting licensees and many markets have aspirants who have been seeking long&hyphen;term licences for over a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed are consistent with the objects of the act: to promote the availability of a diverse range of services; and to promote the role of broadcasting services in developing and reflecting a sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of the current planning process will be maintained. Long&hyphen;term licences will not be allocated to community broadcasters before the formal planning process has been completed. After each licence area has been planned, the amendments will ensure that aspirants can continue broadcasting, in accordance with the new provisions, ahead of any further process of varying the Licence Area Plan which may result in more long&hyphen;term licences. The primary purpose of these amendments is, however, to enable the introduction of continuous transmissions by aspirants ahead of formal planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many aspirant groups will have the opportunity to commence full&hyphen;time broadcasting. It is anticipated that the majority of suitable aspirants will benefit, with access made available to as many as possible. In areas where there is competition for limited spectrum, it is intended that continuous transmissions be made possible through spectrum sharing.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conditions, content rules and remedial and enforcement mechanisms which apply to long&hyphen;term community broadcasting licensees will apply to temporary community broadcasting licensees. The ABA will also have the power to specify the times and the total number of days
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4430"> during which broadcasting will be permitted by the terms of the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this bill, temporary licence holders will not have enhanced rights to the allocation of a community broadcasting licence&mdash;there will be no mechanism for converting a temporary community broadcasting licence into a community broadcasting licence. The likelihood of an aspirant eventually gaining a long&hyphen;term licence will vary from area to area, depending on a number of factors, including both the spectrum made available by the ABA in the planning process and the subsequent evaluation of the merits of applicants in the allocation process conducted by the ABA in accordance with Part 6 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today very briefly to put on record the concerns that I and also my Democrat colleagues have in relation to the participation of young people in the proposed convention. We are very concerned about what we perceive to be a lack of opportunities for younger Australians to be actively involved in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that young Australians, or younger people&mdash;those under the age of 30&mdash;in this country, are among the strongest supporters of the move towards a republic but, regardless of their views about republicanism or constitutional change, young Australians have a right to be actively involved in this process. So not only should young people have a chance to participate but they should be playing a key role in the upcoming convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Australians, those under the age of 30, constitute around a third of this country's population, with 30.5 per cent of Australians under the age of 24. Many of us would know
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that these numbers are not proportionally reflected in decision making bodies or institutions around this country, but 5.5 million young people have their futures and the future of their country wrapped up in the deliberations of that Constitutional Convention. Therefore, I think it is shameful that we are looking at possibly at this stage four younger delegates being appointed&mdash;only four. The government pledged that 10 per cent of those appointed delegates would be young people, so that equates to only four young people between the ages of 18 and 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the answer is simply to say that young people can run for election because, as many of us would know, young people traditionally do not fare well in elections. They have a lack of backing from political parties, a lack of resources and even then they are prohibited from running until they reach the age of 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of public funding, or indeed an absence of public funding, under these arrangements will also mitigate against young people's participation in the electoral process, not to mention people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and other traditionally disadvantaged groups who may be unrepresented or under&hyphen;represented in political decision making bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of young people will have no say in the actual election process, many of them not being able to vote because they have not reached the age of 18. I understand that the government initially canvassed the idea of extending to 17-year-olds the right to vote for the purposes of this convention. I believe this was discussed at a joint party meeting around May last year, but clearly this plan has fallen through, as did the government's purported commitment to involving young Australians in the so-called people's convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad that the government did not take what would have been an unprecedented step, a step that not only would have involved young people in a greater fashion in the constitutional debate but would have demonstrated a commitment to young Australians, their skills, their intelligence, their diversity, their talents at a time when this government seems to be passing proposals and laws that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4431"> only denigrate and are punitive towards young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the four younger appointed delegates all the best with their deliberations and only wish that they were being joined by more of their peers. Again, I do not think young people should simply be tokenly involved in this constitutional process. They deserve a key role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not forget that young people are a heterogeneous group. They are not a generic group. They do not have the same voice, the same views, the same mind. In fact, it is this diversity and difference that deserves to be reflected in the convention, and I think that four younger delegates would hardly allow for a representation of the diversity that we find among young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that young people are among the strongest supporters of a move to a republic. This has been borne out by many surveys and polls. The latest Newspoll shows strong support, around 56 per cent, as a minimum for a move to a republic among 18&hyphen; to 34&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. Youth polls done by the Australian Democrats at our annual youth poll actually demonstrate similar levels of concern. This is not because young people support change for change's sake. Many young people take pride in today's nation. They have a strong grasp of who they are and I really believe that it is this strong sense of national identity that no longer makes a British head of state relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to an Australian head of state is not anti&hyphen;British; it is pro&hyphen;Australian. I do not really believe that young Australians fall for some of the ridiculous arguments that I have seen put forward by some who support a constitutional monarchy, that is, that we seek to emulate our American friends or that we seek to appease our Asian neighbours. As I say, young people take pride in their nation today. They do not see this as an anti&hyphen;British move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, one of my favourite quotes&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;came from Ronald Reagan when he survived an assassination attempt on his life and was being wheeled into the operating room. He turned to the doctors and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, `Please assure me that you are all Republicans.' I am not suggesting that we should take heart from that message and make all a constitutional delegates republicans, but I think we should at least take advantage of the opportunity to shape our own nation's future. We should not be letting others make decisions about our constitution and the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should grasp this opportunity with both hands. But there is little point in being involved in such a process or beginning such a process unless we ensure that all Australians feel that they have a role and are involved in the process of deliberation. That includes people from all backgrounds and cultures, and especially all ages and both sexes. I give my support to constitutional deliberations and the notion of a people's convention, but I put on record today my concerns about the lack of opportunities for young people to participate in that process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 is well worth going through because of what it shows about the bill and the scheme that has been put together through the bill. The second sentence of the second reading speech says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The convention will provide a forum for discussion about whether or not our present constitution should be changed to a republican one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that indicates is that this convention in no way will make any binding decisions. It will not determine anything;  it will simply be a forum for discussion, although a very important forum. Ultimately, we as a nation must make a decision as to whether or not to become a republic or to remain where we presently are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of Australia being a republic is one that is now sanctioned by history. As an example, I will quote from a poem by Henry Lawson which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 1 October 1887, almost 110 years ago. It was a poem entitled `A Song of the  Republic', and it is worth reading the second verse which goes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sons of the South, make choice between</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Sons of the South, choose true),
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4432"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land of Morn and the Land of E'en,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land that belongs to the lord and the Queen,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the Land that belongs to you.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Henry Lawson put forward an idea that has been with Australians for over a century and which has been growing in strength. If there is any criticism to be made of Henry Lawson's verse, it is his reference to the `Sons of the South'. These days we would say `Sons and Daughters'. Louisa Lawson, who was a great feminist, one of the great figures in the women's movement and mother of Henry, perhaps would have been disappointed with her son in his use of the word `Son' and not `Sons and Daughters'. But 110 years ago it was reasonable for Henry to go about his task in the way he did and to set out for us the framework of where our nation is heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear and everybody does agree that ultimately the sentiments put forward by Henry Lawson will come to pass in Australia and Australia will become a republic. The great debate is when and in what fashion. This forum will be another step and a very important step along the road to that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I want to raise relates to a sentence about halfway down the first page of the second reading speech, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . matters of national identity should not be party political issues to be fought over . . . by politicians. We are strongly committed to the principle that this is for the Australian people . . . to determine these issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, that is a statement that politicians should have nothing or very little to do with the convention. If we turn to the second page of the second reading speech it is made quite clear that the government does not intend to keep politicians out of this by any means. The second reading speech says that of the 152 delegates that will be going to this convention, 40 will be parliamentary delegates.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FAULKNER " NAMEID="5K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All elected at compulsory attendance ballots, too.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right: they will all be elected under a compulsory system. Forty of the 152 delegates will be parliamentary delegates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech says that this convention should not be based on party political issues to be fought over by politicians. Yet over the page, the second reading speech says that there will be 40 parliamentary representatives: 20 from the state and territory parliaments and 20 from the Commonwealth parliament. Of the 20 from the Commonwealth parliament, there will be 12 government, six opposition, one from the Democrats and one Independent. The second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This distribution broadly reflects the representation of parties in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is clearly a selection based on a party political consideration. So, whilst it is said earlier in the second reading speech that matters of national identity should not be a party political issue to be fought over by politicians, the very structure of this convention would seem to contradict that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this second reading speech denigrates the contribution that parliamentarians can make and do make by setting out the statement that matters of national identity should not be party political issues to be fought over by politicians. Certainly they should not be fought over, but also certainly they should be discussed and should be debated. They should be debated by politicians, because politicians are people who are elected by the people. This parliament is much more democratically elected and constituted by the democratic process than would be the convention. Indeed, if you look at the convention, half of the delegates will be appointed, and they will be appointed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is proper that we should say something about the position of parliament. Parliament is a democratically elected institution and does represent the choice of the people. For that proposition I rely on a statement by Sir Winston Churchill made on 11 November 1947 when he was debating the Parliament Bill. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right hon. Gentleman spoke about Parliament, about the rights of Parliament, which I shall certainly not fail to defend. But it is not Parliament that should rule; it is the people who should rule through Parliament.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4433"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Parliament is the vehicle that the people use to manifest their will. He has this to say about that later in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of the Parliament Act, and the spirit of that Act, were to give effect, not to spasmodic emotions of the electorate, but to the settled, persistent will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what parliament should be about, and by and large is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This constitutional convention that is to be held does not have, in my view, the same legitimacy as a democratically elected body such as this parliament. One of the main reasons I say that is because this parliament is elected by all the people and by compulsory voting, whereas half of the convention is to be elected by a non&hyphen;compulsory secret postal ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission, and that is set out in the second reading speech. The second reading speech goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Voting will be open to all those on the electoral roll, and will be voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In my view, voting in a matter as important as this should be compulsory. It has been said again and again by those who have spoken before me that it is appropriate and proper that voting should be compulsory because it is the civic duty of people to elect the parliament that is to make the laws that are to govern them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself talks about the duties that people have in political life. Clause 138(1) of the bill illustrates what I mean. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person must not hinder or interfere with the free exercise or performance, by any other person, of any political right or duty that is relevant to an election.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second reading speech talks about non&hyphen;compulsory ballots and voluntary voting. The inference to be drawn from that is that this is a matter of choice; that there is no duty on people to vote and that what all this is about is a matter of right. That being the proposition that the government have put forward, it is surprising to find in their own bill that they are prepared to have people imprisoned for up to six months if they `hinder or interfere with the free exercise or performance' by any person `of any political right or duty that is relevant to an election'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if a duty is so important that anybody who interferes with its exercise can be imprisoned for up to six months why is it that that duty does not extend to voting? Surely the most fundamental political obligation that people in this country have is to vote for the people who make the laws that govern the country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to hear the parliamentary secretary or any senator from the government side who speaks after me in this debate or during the committee stage explain why the penalty of imprisonment should be imposed on those who interfere with people's duties if there is no duty for them to perform under this constitutional convention, if their duty does not include the obligation to vote which, as I say, is an obligation that is placed on people in respect of electing members to this place and which has been entrenched in our political culture for generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important forum. It is a forum that does give a broad range of people an opportunity to make statements about perhaps the great issue that faces Australians at the moment; that is, how they will go forward and what political&mdash;and I do not mean party political&mdash;form they will use in the future to make laws in this country and what constitutional framework we will operate in. They are great issues. It is important, having gone down this path, that everybody in Australia expresses his or her view as to who should be at this forum to enter the discussions about the great issues that face us. It is appropriate that everybody be obliged to vote for those who are going to go there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own belief is that the republic should come sooner rather than later but that it should come by a process where there is as much agreement as possible. There will never be total agreement about that because the nature of political debate is of that kind. I am sure that once a decision for a republic is made, everybody will be unified behind it and it will go forward as a great success. But it is  important that the framework of the republic and the coming of the republic are done as well as possible. It is hoped that this forum will make a significant contribution to that process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with mixed emotion that I rise to speak in this debate on the constitutional convention because this bill is a step towards a republic, a step that I rejoice in. It is a policy that the Labor Party pursued and that I personally have greeted with great pleasure and enthusiasm. I take great pride in the constitution. The aspirations of democracy and optimism that it encapsulates, the solid evidence of courage and energy of the founders of our nation, are contained in that document. But it is not inert; it is not to be handed down and to be immutable. It is a living document created to serve Australia and not to be its master.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right and proper to change the constitution as the aspirations of the nation and its citizens change. The constitution has been amended ever since it was enacted. Almost immediately, in the 1920s, there was discussion about how it should be changed. In the 1920s we had the Premiers Conference. This was followed by the royal commission of 1927&hyphen;29, the 1934 conference, the 1942 convention, the 1956&hyphen;59 constitutional review committee, the 1973&hyphen;85 constitutional conventions and the constitutional commission of 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been 39 occasions on which section 128 of the constitution has been used to put a referendum to the nation. It has been successful on nine occasions. The interesting thing about the successful amendments is that they were not often brought about by conference or convention. Further, the constitution has been refined and, I would argue, altered endlessly by the High Court since 1901. The reality is that substantially the constitution has been a developing and living document, not one that has been unchanged. So the fears that some might express about abandoning the constitution or modernising it are really not something we should concern ourselves with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the view that there has been a fundamental change in the views of the Australian people. There has developed a view that Australia should be a republic and that it should happen reasonably quickly. As happened at the beginning of the constitution, when a fundamental change occurs in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> views of the Australian people, we, as the leaders of the nation, have a responsibility to put that change into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has obviously heard that change, too. He understands that Australians want a republic, and, after some dillydallying, some toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing, he and his government have decided to put something forward that may at least progress us in that direction. But the sad thing is that this Prime Minister, I believe, is not fundamentally in favour of that change. His views are not that of the general population on this issue. In his heart, he does not understand that a republic is what Australians want. Even though he and his government have put forward this bill, he really hopes that it does not succeed. I think that the terms of this bill reflect that fundamental lack of support for Australia's becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the provisions of the bill are absolutely and completely contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy as practised in Australia. I look in particular at the voluntary voting provisions that are contained in this bill, which I feel are completely abhorrent and contrary to bringing about a result that will really reflect the views of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that compulsory voting is unusual. Australia would be one of the few countries in which it is the situation. I have to say that I do not think this is a difference that condemns Australia or shows its weakness; I think it shows, in particular, the fundamental strength of democracy in Australia and the fact that we practise an extraordinarily inclusive form of democracy, and from it we gain benefits that no other countries do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my brief travels around the world, it seems to me that there is a fundamental difference between us and even, say, the democracies of northern America. The USA gives lip service to democracy and has elections but it is not compulsory for people to vote. It is my view that, in that situation, it is  often the people who are the worst off in the community who do not express their democratic views. Often it means that the sorts of people who are elected in the United States are skewed towards those who are better off
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4435"> in the community. Of course, the policies that are then developed are skewed in favour of those who are better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suggest a lack of goodwill on the part of the members of Congress or the Senate in the USA; I merely suggest that this result is brought about by having non&hyphen;compulsory voting. I would suggest to the Senate today that the provision contained in this bill will do exactly the same thing here in Australia. It is a problem and a difficulty that we have avoided to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation here is that, with their eyes open, this Prime Minister and this government have chosen to put before this Senate a proposition for the election of delegates to the convention which, in my view, is undemocratic under the Australian model. He is attempting to exclude a large number of people who may not, if not required, exercise their responsibility to take part in the democratic process. I believe that he is doing it knowingly, to skew the representation at the convention in favour of those who might be conservative, those who are opposed to change, and those who are not in support of the creation of an Australian republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about voluntary voting has gone on for a very long time. In nearly all reports on election issues the matter is raised. But, to date, parliaments wisely have rejected any change to the proposition of compulsory voting. I see no reason why we should make any different choice in this case. I go so far as to say that, without compulsory voting, there will be no democratic process. As for the election of representatives not being democratic, I go so far as to say that the value of this whole convention is brought into question, and it may be that it is of very little value at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, that is not where the lack of democracy in this bill ends. It is exacerbated by the additional provision that voting should be by postal vote. Looking at the report on the bill, the only argument that I can see put forward by the members of the government for this proposal is cost. The cost of democracy is too high for this government to bear. It is really a very sad proposition that they would trade off democracy and the proper development of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the constitution&mdash;becoming a republic is probably one of the most fundamental steps that we are going to take&mdash;because of cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose people may think it is silly, but you really have to look at the natural extension of this argument. Are all referendums too expensive? Are all elections too expensive? Wouldn't it be cheaper just to appoint our representatives? Wouldn't it be preferable that we have a system&mdash;as some parts of the House of Lords still exercise&mdash;of having appointments for life? Wouldn't that be cheaper? There would be no elections at the beginning of or during the appointment of a person elected for life. Of course, if you accept that it is democratic not to have an election, or a proper one, then you must accept that in all cases that is all right&mdash;if it is too expensive, you do away with the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Postal voting means that those people who have a limited wage; those who do not have a permanent place of abode; those who are homeless; those whose lives are disrupted by family breakdown, drug addiction, unemployment or a death in the family; and those people whose lives are uncertain are disadvantaged because when their voting papers are posted out they may well not be at the address they were at when they first enrolled. They may not, in the difficulties of their lives, have taken the time to notify the Electoral Commission of their change of address. But this Prime Minister and this government think that is all right; that those people can be excluded because, somehow, their views are of less importance than those of other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who else is excluded by postal voting? Those people who have difficulty with the English language because they are immigrants for whom English is their second language or because, through disability or lack of opportunity in education, they are functionally illiterate are disadvantaged by postal voting. Those are the people who would find that rather difficult. But, according to this bill,  according to this government and according to this Prime Minister, it is all right if immigrants and those who have difficulty with the written language are excluded. This government feels that their views are of less import
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4436"> ance than those of other people who are in a better financial position. That is a very sad proposition. Democracy, in my view, requires the exercise of everyone's rights and duties to participate in the direction of Australia and in particular in this very important step which is the creation of a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about the exclusion of people we should also look at who is going to be included at that convention and at the lack of provision for the representation of a diversity of Australians. It should not just represent one group&mdash;the group that Mr Howard sees himself representing. No provision is made in this bill for the proper representation of women at the convention&mdash;or other groups either, for that matter. In fact, there is nothing even contained in the preamble that suggests that there should be some sort of broad representation of all the groups that are represented in the Australian community. Again, this is a very sad oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amendment has been suggested by the Democrats that requires that half the people on a ticket be women. I applaud their objective, as stated by Senator Cheryl Kernot last night, but I cannot see this as being a solution to the problem because, as we all know, if there is a gap many people will fill it. This provision would certainly allow a ticket to run, say, 10 men first and 10 women second, so that even though women were represented on the ticket they would have absolutely no hope of being elected to the convention. If this were to occur it would be trivialising and upsetting for women generally&mdash;certainly to me&mdash;to see them being used in that sort of way. So I do not think we can see ourselves clear to support that Democrat amendment. Probably privately the Democrats themselves would concede the difficulty with their proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is putting forward a preamble that makes it very clear that it is expected that there will be representation from all sectors of the community in Australia. I suppose to some extent we will be relying on the goodwill of those who are running tickets and those members of the parliaments, both federal and state, who are appointing deleg
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ates to the convention to ensure that there is broad representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues that I have raised in my mind suggest that, although this appears to be a democratic attempt to move towards a republic, the bill itself does not satisfy that objective. It does not satisfy that objective because, fundamentally, the coalition does not really aspire to that objective. There may be sections in the coalition and certainly sections within the Liberal Party&mdash;I know there are because I have spoken to them&mdash;who are very supportive of a republic. But as a whole the coalition is not. Certainly the voices of those within the Liberal Party who would support a republic have been quashed.</PARA>

Maybe the parliamentary secretary could enlighten us on this issue when he gets to his feet.

It is really a very sad thing that even within their own party they cannot be democratic. They cannot give equal weight to the voices in their own party that support a republic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. According to the explanatory memorandum issued with this bill, the purpose of this bill is to establish `a process for the election of delegates to the proposed Constitutional Convention, which is scheduled to meet in December 1997'. That Constitutional Convention will consider what Australians think about changing our constitutional structure to make it a republic rather than a constitutional monarchy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that the parliament has before it is a substantial document. It runs for 129 pages. It is a thick and weighty tome, but it is far from perfect. It needs to be amended in several respects. It needs to be amended to require the holding of a compulsory attendance ballot conducted by whatever reasonable means are available to reduce the cost of the ballot whilst maintaining the ballot's integrity. In other words, this bill does not require compulsory secret voting. It requires voluntary postal voting, and that needs to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill needs to be changed to ensure that the ballot is conducted in a manner that is as similar to that used for election to the Senate as is possible. This bill provides that a new form of ballot paper be issued which would be alien to the experience of most electors. The ballot paper should conform to the experience of most electors so they are familiar with it and can exercise their democratic choice in familiar surroundings, not in new and confusing ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should be amended to provide for 20 appointed federal delegates&mdash;10 appointed by the Prime Minister, eight by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the Leader of the Australian Democrats and one to be drawn at random from the minor party and Independent members. That would obviate the allegation that this Constitutional Convention is being stacked up&hyphen;front by the government to reflect its view. It would recognise the principle that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a constitutional convention should be a gathering of all Australians of all views coming together to represent a fundamental discussion about the future of our nation. There should be no argument that this is being stacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill should be amended to provide for four appointed state parliamentary delegates per state&mdash;two to be appointed by the Premier and two to be appointed by the Leader of the Opposition; to provide for two appointed territory representatives from each of the ACT and the Northern Territory by the Chief Minister and the Leader of the Opposition; to provide for 28 community delegates to be appointed by a two&hyphen;thirds majority of the appointed federal parliamentary delegates; to provide for an independent, non-voting chair of the convention to be appointed by a two&hyphen;thirds majority of the appointed federal parliamentary delegates; and to provide for the rules and procedures of the convention to be determined by a two&hyphen;thirds majority of the appointed federal parliamentary delegates, subject to amendment by the convention itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill reflected those changes, this bill would have the unanimous support of the opposition and would be a bill which would unite this country and strengthen our constitution at a time in which we might alter it to better reflect modern day thinking. If the bill was amended in those terms, it would, I believe, meet the criticisms of it that have been offered by the Australian Republican Movement. I seek leave of the Senate to now incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from Mr Malcolm Turnbull, Chairman of the Republican Movement, setting down his criticisms of this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the chamber. I have sat through many thousands of speeches during my parliamentary career. When you listen to them all and you hark back, it is rare that you can recall many of them. One of the speeches that I do recall, and I think I will remember it for the rest of my life, is a speech that was delivered by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, on 7 June 1995. It took the form of a ministerial statement. It was headed simply `Republic'. I believe that was a seminal speech. It was a speech for history. I read it again last night in preparing my remarks for today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a speech that is basically about the processes to achieve a republic for Australia, but it is much more than that. It has a grandeur, a sense of occasion. It has a considered logic, explained reasonably and with understanding. Above all, it has a firm goal of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia becoming a republic. It is a speech, I believe, of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By comparison, the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) accompanying this bill falls far short. It is a comparison that does not flatter the current Prime Minister's second reading speech. That speech is lost in superfluous technocratic detail. It does not have a vision. In many respects, it is a narrow and, some would say, a mean speech. To illustrate the point that I make, let me quote from the Keating speech of 7 June 1995. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are attached to Great Britain by long threads of kinship and affection which, to a considerable extent, are embodied in the warmth of our regard for Queen Elizabeth. Many Australians may well feel that to substitute an Australian for the monarchy constitutes in some way a rejection of these ties. I think all of us can understand these feelings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the creation of an Australian republic is not an act of rejection. It is one of recognition: in making the change we will recognise that our deepest respect is for our Australian heritage, our deepest affection is for Australia, and our deepest responsibility is to Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in the creation of an Australian republic will alter the facts of our heritage and our affections.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that accurately encapsulates the feeling of many of us who seek a republic for this nation. The speech goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queen of Australia is also Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other countries in the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding that The Queen is Australia's Head of State and fulfils that duty conscientiously, when she travels overseas she represents only the United Kingdom. Her visits abroad often tend to promote British trade and British interests&mdash;they do not promote Australia's trade and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is, of course, right and proper for the Head of State of the United Kingdom. But it is not right for Australia. The right Head of State for Australia is one of us, embodying the things for which we stand, reminding us of those things at home and representing them abroad. We number among those  things fairness, tolerance and love of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">this</EMPHASIS>  country. It is a role only an Australian can fill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The speech goes on and is replete with many examples of that type of sensitivity and understanding, with the calm assertion that this is an independent nation and should make independent constitutional arrangements for its
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4439"> head of state to be an Australian within an Australian structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no sense can it be said that the second reading speech accompanying this bill captures anything like that sense of destiny, that sense of a nation being called together to consider what form its constitutional structure should take. That is regrettable. It was an opportunity for this government to stamp some vision on the direction of this nation; it was an opportunity that, when one reads the speech by the Prime Minister, one would have to say has been emphatically declined&mdash;and regrettably so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me declare my position in this debate. I am in favour of Australia becoming a constitutional republic. I am in favour of Australia achieving that by a minimalist route. As someone who believes that that is the goal and recognises that many Australians, indeed, a majority of us, support that view and that many others might hold that a constitutional monarchy is the appropriate form, I nonetheless say that a republic is inevitable. Despite all of that, I have to say&mdash;and I believe this is the sentiment of all republicans&mdash;that we should be insistent that the process by which this nation chooses to be a republic is a process which is fair to all Australians, irrespective of their views on this subject, is inclusive of their concerns and is acceptable. At the end of the process, the decision should have strengthened this country, not weakened and divided it. The convention we are debating in this bill will be critical in redefining our nation whatever its outcome. It will be about how we see ourselves and how the world sees us. Therefore, as a convention, it should be inclusive and not divisive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the bill itself and some of the features of it which I regard as necessary to achieve the principles that I have just espoused&mdash;principles which ought to be eternal between all parties and all Australians, irrespective of their views of the particular issue. The first and most obvious defect in this legislation is that it proposes to introduce what is for Australia a bizarre voting system. I think it is a sad irony that, in setting up a Constitutional Convention to determine the structure of our democracy, we propose to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce a new and alien voting system that is not the Australian ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, in the history of world democracy, has a proud place. For many years the secret ballot was known around the world as the Australian ballot. A feature of the way in which we conduct that ballot is that it is compulsory for Australians to vote. This legislation makes it voluntary for Australians to vote&mdash;and that flies in the face of what Australians themselves want. In all the polls that I have seen asking whether voting should be compulsory or voluntary, around 70 per cent of Australians say it should be compulsory. But this legislation proposes to make it voluntary&mdash;not voluntary in the sense that you can choose whether to turn up at the polling booth on the day but voluntary and postal. That is to say, a letter arrives and if you open it, read it and answer it you can then exercise a ballot and vote on the composition of this convention. That is not a system of election that we have ever had in this country for major matters. It is not a system that Australians are familiar with at all. It operates to some extent, but in a limited way, at local government level. Only this year in my own state of Western Australia has that been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for major matters of nationhood this is a mean way to conduct a ballot, and that ought to change. Our voting system is a tried and tested voting system. To introduce a new voting system now at the eleventh hour does raise the question: why would anyone want to do that? When I scrutinise the speech delivered by the Prime Minister to try to discover the motive for changing the voting system, the only explanation that becomes readily apparent in the technocratic jargon of a dense speech about superfluous detail is one of cost. I believe the costs of a compulsory secret ballot have been inflated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the costs are not so wildly different as to justify a change in the manner in which we cast votes in this nation. Therefore, one thinks when looking at the agenda for dealing with this issue: is there a hidden agenda that is not obvious? Anyone that follows political debate
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4440"> in Australia knows that within the government itself there is an intense discussion about trying to change the voting system from being compulsory to voluntary. As far as I can observe, the government has not made a decision about that and within its own ranks there are views either way on the issue. Nonetheless, for a cynic, this bill can be seen as a trial horse for such a voting system&mdash;and that in itself would be a sinister motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it has an even more sinister dimension. Notoriously, voluntary voting by post does not obtain a voting turnout of 100 per cent. In local government elections where there is voluntary voting local government candidates often think they have a good turnout if the turnout is around 20 per cent or 30 per cent. If it is up around 40 per cent or 50 per cent, that is a stunning turnout. I do not know what the turnout will be in voting for this convention. For Australians to be aware of the gravity of what they are being asked to decide in but a few months, the issue certainly needs to obtain more publicity. But, if the turnout is less than 70 per cent or 80 per cent&mdash;and it could well be, given the lack of knowledge about voluntary postal voting&mdash;then those who are opposed to the process by which we would decide that this nation should become a republic will argue that this is not an important issue but one that should be put aside and not returned to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sinister dimension that I see in making the voting system not the one we are used to but a new and different voting system is that it denigrates what most Australians in all the opinion polls have said&mdash;that is, that they want a republic&mdash;and makes it harder for that to be achieved, putting hurdles in their way and confecting the arrangements in a manner in which it can be contended that the support is genuinely not there, when seriously and genuinely it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, this issue of voting is a matter of contention and division already. It is a matter of division when the primary task of government here is to unite the country in this process of deciding the outcome of the issue. Up&hyphen;front, a divisive matter has intruded, which gives support to the claim that the government is not really serious about setting
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in place a fair program by which this country can determine whether it becomes a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of my colleagues have made a series of other quite important points about the voluntary voting system. Those Australians out of the country at the time will not have a vote. For those Australians who have difficulty with English as their first language, the ballot paper and the process will be confusing, and they may risk being disenfranchised because of a lack of facility with the English language&mdash;and they will not be in a polling booth where they can go and ask for information. Those Australians in situations of real need or between addresses or not on the voting roll&mdash;and there is a significant number of them at any one time&mdash;will be disenfranchised too. There is no reason why any of those Australians should miss the opportunity to express a view about whether Australia should be a constitutional monarchy, as it now is, or whether it should become part of the modern world, becoming a republic, as most Australians wish. But this system denies those classes of Australians a chance to exercise a view. For that reason, whether you are a monarchist or a republican, this clause in this bill should change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that many of my colleagues in this debate have spoken about is the ballot paper itself. It is to resemble the system of voting for the Senate. Most Australians find the Senate voting system a little confusing: there is a higher level of informal votes in the Senate than in the House of Representatives. But the system we have is the system we know, and to turn that system on its head and change the nature of the ticket and introduce something new is to add a dimension of unnecessary confusion which is, again, divisive and raises the question of what the real agenda here is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One may ask what purpose that confusion serves. It does not serve the Australian people or the purpose of a fair process here. It does  not serve the purpose of creating a sense of occasion&mdash;we are deciding our nation's future and the constitutional trappings of our nationhood. It does not serve any of those purposes. The only purpose it serves is that of those who wish to bring this process into disrepute
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4441"> and to put roadblocks, obstacles and hurdles in the way of Australia's moving to make a fair decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever one stands in this debate&mdash;as a monarchist, a republican or someone who does not know&mdash;the process of the ballot should be something we all understand, because, at the end of the day, whatever the outcome, any of the groups, republican or monarchist, will want to be able to express their view as to what it really means. If the process is not fair, if the ballot paper is new and confusing, if the ballot itself is voluntary and postal&mdash;not compulsory and secret at the polling booth&mdash;then neither of the groups and none of the interests in Australia will be able to say conclusively what the meaning of the outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the amendments I referred to. I commend them to the Senate. I trust the chamber can, across the divide of political parties, find a unity around these issues, because this is a question of the destiny of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very difficult to come to grips with the position that you have taken in putting this legislation together. You have proposed that only half of this convention will be elected, yet in the past you have taken a populist approach on many issues, where you have said time and again that the majority of Australians want something. My view about the question that ought to be put to the Australian public is: one question, one vote. That is, do they want Australia to become a republic? That is the ballot that should be held&mdash;no other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My party is proposing amendments to this legislation that would clearly make it fairer, that would clearly make it better and would retain one fundamental and very important issue: compulsory voting. Despite the fact of it being compulsory, people do get to have their say. They do get to make the judgment on those people who will govern them and we should at least retain that fundamental aspect of the Australian way of life. As some of my colleagues have said, many other countries wish they had the same sort of voting system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to where Australia is proceeding, I would just like to refer back to the statement made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 7 June, 1995. In part, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are approaching the 21st century and the centenary of our nationhood. As never before we are making our own way in our region and the world.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that if the plans for our nationhood were being drawn up now, by this generation of Australians and not those of a century ago, it is beyond question that

In fact, I think that if we never had the historic link with the monarchy, that is exactly how all of us would feel. Indeed, I know that many of the conservative members of parliament feel that way. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in the creation of an Australian republic will alter the facts of our heritage and our affections. Indeed our relationship with Britain may well become the more thoroughly `modern relationship' which the British Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">then John Major&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">expressed a desire for two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are friends with separate destinies to carve out in the world. We are not as we once were, in a parent-child relationship.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is true. If you look at the polls, they have clearly shown that a majority of Australians want Australia to become a republic. If we do it by the year 2000, nothing could be better. It really would be, I think, the icing on the cake for the 2000 Olympics here in Australia to be opened by an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look at many things, for example, the position of the RSL in my own home state. The RSL took action against a person whom I know very well and who is also a life member of the RSL, Mick Walker, when he made a comment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The polls have clearly shown that Australians would like to see Australia become a republic, not because of any distaste or any regret with regards to our association and our historical links with Great Britain but more because of the fact&mdash;as I said when I read the words of former Prime Minister Keating&mdash;that we are growing up, developing as a nation in our own way and seeking our own place in the world.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the ballot process which has been raised really is one of the most pathetic, almost fraudulent arrangements that you would want to see. I had a look at the draft ballot paper. If you wanted to fix a ballot, that is exactly the sort of ballot paper you would have. You would make it so confusing that people would not be able to fill it out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, of course, pursued a course of action that will make this legislation fairer. My personal view is that it should be defeated, it should be turfed out and we should have just one ballot of the Australian public. They will, clearly, make a decision as to whether or not they want a republic. Once that decision has been taken, what is the point of having some convention to determine the type of republic? How many different types of republics are there, 55, 100? Certainly not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely there are people within both the parliament and the country who could sit down and very quickly put together the changes needed to the constitution and essentially work out the change that we would make in so far as becoming a republic is concerned. Why do we have to have 152 people sit down and jawbone over the fact, and never reach agreement about the specific nature of the type of republic that Australia should have? If they did, what would be the purpose of then having a vote. If you have a consensus of the representatives who have been both appointed and elected to come to a conclusion about (a) yes, we will have a republic and (b) this is the type of republic we will have, why then are we having a referendum? What is leadership in this country about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we should give the people a say as to whether or not they want Australia to become a republic. You really do not have to have a ballot for that because we know what the result of that would be. We know the clear majority of Australians want that. So why don't we just get on with the job of actually determining what form of a republic we will have. That is not a big job. If the government and a few other people could not sit down  and work that out, it is no wonder we have the problems we have with unemployment. It is no wonder we have the problems with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4444"> regard to the credibility of politicians because there is no leadership in the way the Prime Minister is taking this country on this issue, let alone most other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how thick the envelope is but, as I understand from the report, the envelope that all this information is going to be sent out in is slightly bigger than a DL envelope which takes an A4 piece of paper folded three times. Two envelopes, the ballot paper and a booklet with all of the candidates in it&mdash;it is going to be a fairly thick booklet in New South Wales&mdash;are going to be sent out. The poor old punter gets that and, if he wants to vote for a group but does not want to vote for the group in the order on the ballot paper, he has to look through the booklet, identify the number of the candidate that he wants to vote for first, and so on. What a ridiculous situation and time wasting exercise. It is a most disgraceful waste of public money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was looking at the constitutional reform section of the law and justice policy of the Liberal Party before the last election. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National Government will&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is the first dot point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that as an overriding principle, the Australian people are involved in the process of debating our Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the first dot point in your policy; yet you seek to deny the vast majority of Australians the right to vote. You have given no justification for that. The government says, `We're going to make a provision for the people serving down in Antarctica to vote, but we're not going to make any provision for people serving overseas elsewhere. Indeed, even if they're in the Defence Force, they don't get a chance to vote.' Why is that the case? Why is it that we can send the ballot papers down to Antarctica but we cannot send them to other Australians elsewhere?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period is one week, I think, from the time the ballot papers are sent out. The whole thing, as I said at the outset, just stinks. It is a most dirty, despicable attempt to defraud the Australian people of a right that they have had for so long. You know from the committee's inquiry that up to three million Australians may well not even get the ballot
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> papers, let alone fill them in. So when you send it out&mdash;you can expect no more than a 30 per cent return; and I doubt that you will get a 30 per cent return&mdash;only a very small part of the population will get a say on this issue. How does that fit in with your overriding principle that all Australian people will have a right to participate in this debate? It does not at all. There is total denial and no opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I hope the amendments proposed by the opposition will be supported. I certainly hope that the Independent senators will see their way clear to support the right of the Australian public to have a say. But, from a personal point of view, I would like to see the legislation defeated altogether and for there to be an agreement whereby the Australian public are given the opportunity to simply say, `Yes, we do,' or, `No, we don't want Australia to become a republic.' Then the government should get on with the job of following the direction and the request of the Australian public. So, as I said, I hope the amendments are supported, but I have a personal preference to see the whole thing kicked out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out that we should pay considerable credit to former Prime Minister Paul Keating for the remarks he made on several occasions that have established the  fact that we should have an Australian citizen as our head of state. I believe he made a speech in 1993 that started to set the tenor
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4445"> about our national character, or national image, that leads inexorably to why we must have an Australian citizen as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those speeches, which I think has been recognised by even some of his fiercest critics as one of the great speeches, was on 11 November 1993, when he spoke at the unveiling of the new war memorial for the Unknown Soldier in Canberra. For the first time, we interred in Australia the remains of an unknown soldier from the First World War battlefields of France. Then Prime Minister Keating, in a short speech about this unknown soldier, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not know this Australian's name and we never will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not know his rank or his battalion. We do not know where he was born, or precisely how and when he died. We do not know where in Australia he had made his home or when he left it for the battlefields of Europe. We do not know his age or his circumstances&mdash;whether he was from the city or the bush; what occupation he left to become a soldier; what religion; if he was married or single. We do not know who loved him or whom he loved. If he had children we do not know who they are. His family is lost to us as he was lost to them. We will never know who this Australian was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet he has always been among those we have honoured. We know that he was one of the 45,000 Australians who died on the Western Front. One of the 416,000 Australians who volunteered for service in the First World War. One of the 324,000 Australians who served overseas in that war, and one of the 60,000 Australians who died on foreign soil. One of the 100,000 Australians who have died in wars this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is all of them. And he is one of us.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That phrase `and he is one of us' is the phrase that resonated at that ceremony as what the Unknown Soldier represented to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then Prime Minister returned to that theme when he made a speech in the Australian parliament on 7 June 1995 when he responded to the Turnbull committee about the need for Australia to become a republic and the process we should go through, a speech that again has been recognised even by his severest critics as being an outstanding speech that will stand the test of time. The then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, concluded that speech with the following words:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meaning&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of a republic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is simple and, we believe, irresistible&mdash;as simple and irresistible as the idea of a Commonwealth of Australia was to the Australians of a century ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meaning then was a nation united in common cause for the common good. A nation which gave expression to the lives we lead together on this continent, the experience and hopes we share as Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meaning now is still a product of that founding sentiment&mdash;it is that we are all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future. And our Head of State should be one of us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, he returned to the phrase `should be one of us', and that is the phrase that is resonating in Australia. Despite all the argy-bargy, all the fine detail, about what form an Australian republic should take, overwhelmingly Australia wants an Australian citizen to be our head of state. It is, in my view, an argument that cannot be beaten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some extraordinary comments have been made by those who still proclaim themselves to be constitutional monarchists that we do not need to change the constitution because we are a de facto republic already, that our Governor-General is in fact the head of state. That is a fictitious heap of lies. The head of state of Australia is whomever is the monarch of Great Britain. That is what our constitution says, and it cannot be argued any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard on the radio only two days ago Mr Abbott, a Liberal member from the lower house and a parliamentary secretary in this government, declare that the Governor-General was our head of state. That is a lie. It is not correct. The constitution does not describe the Governor-General as a head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have even seen articles written by our eminent Clerk of the Senate saying that we do not need to change because in fact we are a de facto republic in every sense other than whom our head of state is. I do not think any country can exist on the basis of saying, `We  do not need to change because, de facto, we are already a republic.' Whether it is Mr Evans, who is arguing, I think, for a wider issue about his concern for what it may mean for the Senate rather than the even broader issue about an Australian identity and Austral
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4446"> ian republic, or the constitutional monarchists like Mr Abbott and other representatives going around saying that the Governor-General is the head of state, that is patently absurd. The former Prime Minister made it very clear in one simple message: an Australian citizen shall be our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In I think 1988 we carried laws in Australia that made it final that the English parliament could carry no law that could affect the running and management of Australia; that is, except for one issue: the British parliament still has the power to make whom they like the King or Queen of England. If the new Labour government wanted to sack the House of Windsor and appoint Arthur Scargill&mdash;highly unlikely&mdash;as the King of England and they had a majority in the House of Commons, it would happen. That would automatically mean that person would be the King or Queen of Australia. We would have no say in it. To me it is an absolute absurdity that, at the end of the 20th century and going into the 21st century, a parliament of another country can decide on its own and without reference to us that it has the power to decide who shall be the King or Queen of England and therefore our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we have the absurdity of English law saying a Roman Catholic cannot be the King or Queen, which means our head of state cannot be a Roman Catholic and has to be a member of the Church of England.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to turn to the bill itself. I find it ironic that the person responsible for this legislation is Senator Minchin, an absolutely avowed monarchist who is also avowedly in favour of voluntary voting. He has put the two together. He has had an absolute free kick and said, `I will put up a constitutional convention model that makes it almost unworkable, where you have appointed delegates and elected delegates and where we will have it by a voluntary postal ballot.' It is a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin comes from a state which has as one of its proudest records the fact that in 1856 South Australia was the first place in the western world to introduce the secret ballot. For the first time it could not be  identified how people voted and for which candidate and 141 years later a senator from South Australia is proposing in parliament that you get rid of secret ballot and have a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4447"> postal ballot that cannot be guaranteed to be secret. It is the irony of ironies that a senator from South Australia should propose that on behalf of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should identify absolutely the contradiction of this senator as a parliamentary senator representing the Prime Minister and handling this matter. It would be as big a joke if you asked a republican such as myself to work on preparing a submission on how to reintroduce imperial honours in Australia. It would be ridiculous to ask any of us on that issue, just as it is ridiculous to ask an avowed monarchist when you are in the process of creating open and fair debate about how Australia should progress to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, raised some very good issues in his speech on behalf of the opposition about the way a postal ballot would be rorted. The first issue he hit right on the head is Senator Minchin's argument in favour of cost. Senator Minchin said a normal, full secret ballot with polling booths, secret ballot boxes, et cetera, would cost around $50 million. He said a postal ballot would cost around $35 million. Senator Bolkus has pointed out in his speech and in information gathered from the Australian Postal Commission that, with the size of the ballot paper in New South Wales and the explanatory document, the postal costs will be a lot more and the difference will be more like approximately $5 million at the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the argument of cost goes out the window. If it will cost almost the same for a postal ballot as it does for a full election, we ought to go for the full election. Therefore it will be a guaranteed secret ballot and those people elected have an enhanced credibility. They can go to the convention knowing that they have been elected by a compulsory ballot of the 10 million&hyphen;odd eligible voters right across Australia. We will overcome all the problems of a postal ballot being rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus has pointed out in evidence before the legislative committee on this that as many as three million people may have changed addresses since the last federal election. How do we know that when the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ballot paper is mailed to those addresses the people named on the ballot paper will be the same who fill it in? We have no guarantee. How do we know what assistance the one or two million people who have difficulty with the English language will get to fill in ballot paper? None. It is wide open to be rorted. That is why we strongly oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also strongly oppose the fact that the credibility of this convention will really be more than somewhat compromised. But we are willing to accept it, if we get a proper, compulsory, full secret ballot and attendance at polling booths. What is the government doing about the process of appointment? They are fixing the appointment to give them the best possible advantage of ensuring that, because of the numbers at the convention, they will be able to claim that there is a great division of opinion.</PARA>

Those delegates who actually will be elected&mdash;as we hope by a full secret ballot and by attendance at polling booths&mdash;will have credibility and be able to say, `We are representative of the 10 million Australian voters eligible to vote.' That credibility can never be undermined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This mob in government wants to have a postal ballot with a large number of ballot papers disappearing and a large number not even being returned. It will be a voluntary vote and therefore those elected will have their credibility diminished. They will not be able to claim to represent the Australian voting public like all of us in this chamber can. Whether we disagree with each other or not, the bottom line is that all of Australia has voted to put us in here and in three or six years' time they can vote to put us out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sovereignty of the actual ballot, the secret, compulsory ballot, is one of the endur
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4448"> ing features and strengths of our democracy in Australia. It is something that this parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, wishes to undermine. We believes that having a first go at a voluntary ballot will be an excuse to undermine the compulsory ballot overall in Australia. He has had a chance in South Australia. He has convinced the Liberal government there to introduce voluntary voting under his influence. He has now used his influence on the parliamentary committee to introduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody knows that overwhelmingly Australians believe by a margin of 70 per cent to 30 per cent that compulsory voting is a feature they wish to retain. Most other countries look at our system and say there is much to commend it. You know that when you get all the people voting, you cannot argue that you have not got some sort of mandate. We cannot argue that in the lower house the Liberal Party has been overwhelmingly elected on a two&hyphen;party preferred vote of over 50 per cent. We cannot argue that in the Senate over the six&hyphen;year period the numbers here reflect how people have voted under a PR ballot. But Senator Minchin wants to undermine that. He is using the Constitutional Convention as a device to inhibit the development of ordinary Australians' desire to have an Australian citizen as head of state and to run his own political agenda of undermining the compulsory secret ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we are moving amendments, and no threat, no blackmail from the parliamentary secretary on behalf of the Prime Minister will get us to back down on this. We have made it clear that this is an important and fundamental democratic principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased and honoured to speak in this debate. I was honoured in 1991, as a delegate to the national conference, to move the resolution that established as Labor Party policy that by the year 2001, the centenary of federation, Australia shall be a republic. Of all the things I have done in the Labor Party and in the public forum over the last 25 years I have been involved in public life in politics, that is the one I take the greatest honour from&mdash;having had the opportunity to move

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is an honour to have another chance to speak in the parliamentary forum in favour of a republic, but through a process that is decent and uncorrupted, unlike what Senator Minchin has put.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being serious, it is very important that this issue of compulsory or voluntary voting in the convention is addressed directly. In Australia, despite the way the debate is characterised, we do not have compulsory voting; we have compulsory attendance at the polling booth. That is a very important distinction. You are not compelled to vote for either party or even an Independent candidate. You are simply compelled to turn up at the polling place, have your name crossed off and receive a ballot paper. What you do with the ballot paper after that is entirely up to you. Some choose to throw it away, some choose to deliberately vote informal, but the vast majority of Australians cast formal votes. Between 92 and 95 per cent of Australians regularly turn up and cast formal votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4449">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some sections of the conservatives cry currently, `How can we have a free society when we are compelling people to turn up to the polling booth?' What I say to those members of the coalition is that society compels citizens to do a whole range of things currently, of which turning up to a polling booth once every three years is probably the smallest. It includes things like compelling people to send their children to school. It is compulsory for children to go to school. It is compulsory in all states that you cannot be drunk while driving. There are laws that say you are not allowed to drink&hyphen;drive. There are laws that say you are not allowed to go as fast as you want when you are driving your car. Despite the many attempts of the coalition to let their mates out of the taxation system by way of loopholes, it is compulsory to pay tax each year. In particular, the conservatives have recently articulated the question of mutual obligation in respect of work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is compulsion from this government, as there has been from all previous governments, in many areas of Australian life. A compulsion to attend a polling place once every three years, as I said earlier, is probably the smallest of all the compulsions that a government places on its citizens. It is not as if it is an extraordinary thing or the only thing they are compelled to do. It is one of many things that a government requires of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All polling that has been done on this issue shows an overwhelming majority of support for compulsory voting. So we have a situation where half a dozen people have chosen to defy a court and not pay a fine and they have gone to gaol of their own choice. It is no different from being issued a parking ticket and refusing to pay the fine. What happens? You go to gaol. It is no different. You are issued a fine, you refuse to pay and the court sends you to gaol. I do not see any great outcry about people who have conscientiously refused to accept the parking laws, who have exercised their right to choose not to pay a fine for a parking ticket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you begin to get into the question of why the coalition, and Senator Minchin in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular, would be pushing this. If Senator Minchin knew that a coalition government was going to automatically suffer a predicted two per cent swing against it as a result of introducing voluntary voting, do you think seriously&mdash;I am a bit of a cynic, but I would be happy to have Senator Minchin dispel my cynicism&mdash;he would be the champion of those six people who were in gaol for 24 hours? I think not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two per cent figure is not something I have concocted; it comes from independent analysts. Malcolm Mackerras was on the radio yesterday making it quite clear&mdash;</PARA>

Malcolm Mackerras is not a great fan of the Labor Party&mdash;he handed out for the Liberal Party at the last election, I understood, up in Belconnen. There would be a two per cent swing to the right in politics. That is the agenda. If the Liberals had the honesty to stand up and say, `What we are proposing is an electoral system that will benefit us,' you would at least have some respect for them; at least they would be up&hyphen;front in what they are about, not carrying on about personal philosophies on compulsion and how terrible it was that people were gaoled for their political beliefs. It is nothing more than a cynical exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Studies carried out by Republicans in America have identified that in America with voluntary voting it is the rich who turn out to vote; the top income earners all turn out to vote. Those who feel disenfranchised, those who are down the income scale, the racial minorities, the young, those who lack tertiary education and those who move a lot through work or for other reasons are the people who do not vote. That is what the studies show. The rich vote and the disadvantaged tend to vote less. That is what Senator Minchin and those supporting him are really about. The convention vote is just the first step.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It currently is, but if you want to change that I will support you. It is very simple. One of the other reasons that I have heard advocated for doing away with compulsory voting is to do with a lack of education. They have failed to educate Australians in the way they address politics. That is not an argument to do away with compulsory voting; it is an argument to include course content in studies of civics, a greater study of Australian political structures and a campaign by the government to promote information about Australia's parliament. Do we see that being advocated? No They say they are concerned about the lack of education. What are they doing about it in this bill and in other bills? They are doing nothing. There is no education campaign planned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on talkback radio in Queensland this morning and other arguments given were that voluntary voting would see a better style of campaigning&mdash;fewer negative ads. Petro Georgiou has rebutted that more than adequately. In other countries, particularly in America, they have only negative advertising; the whole thrust of American political campaigning is to denigrate the opposition, disillusion potential supporters of the opposition and make sure as few people as possible turn up to vote for your opponent. That is the electoral strategy. It is not about maximising participation; it is about minimising your opponent's vote. That is the consequence of the voluntary voting system. There will be no increase, as Petro Georgiou, the member for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4451"> Kooyong, suggested, in the higher political debate. It will become more base than it is now, because you appeal just to your narrow sectional interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that Australia is out of step with the world, that compulsory voting is an anachronism. The experience I have had from meeting different people from other countries who have come here and looked at our electoral system is that they are very impressed by our participation rate. They think that 95 per cent of Australians voting for their government makes it representative. They are prepared to say that this is the sort of thing that they want to encourage overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to Mr Georgiou's speech to the John Stuart Mill Society, which sums up a very important point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They know this is not a flagrant attack on their rights and freedoms which undermines Australian democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They know it for what it is; a symbolic nudge that voting is important and embodies a widely held community consensus that they share in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that what politics is about in principle is the pursuit of the public good, defined in the broadest sense. To me, this axiomatically involves trying to get as many people as possible to participate, to invest in the democratic process at the time when it is most meaningful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the vote is about the only resource electors possess in which there is an approximation of equality. For electors it gives an opportunity, and still an imperfect one, to overcome momentarily the inequalities of income, age, wealth, sex, colour, ethnicity, occupation and location.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what it is about. That is why this bill should be amended&mdash;so that, through compulsory voting, all Australians are able to participate, so that they are not going to be driven out of the system by the advertising and be disillusioned by the process, and so that they feel they have some ownership of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the news polls that have been done on this overwhelmingly support compulsory voting. What the recent news poll showed, though, was that 19 per cent of ALP voters said they might not vote and that only 14 per cent of coalition voters said they would not vote. That is where this is really gross. This is self-interest masked behind philosophies about freedom of choice. This
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate over the convention and our electoral system will go on for some time yet, and I welcome the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been suggestions that compulsory voting forces a concentration of resources by political parties into marginal seats; that, therefore, people in safe seats will be ignored by the political parties; and that voluntary voting would mean that would not happen. Unfortunately, the marginal seats strategy&mdash;which Senator Minchin and others in the Liberal Party have successfully implemented recently&mdash;is about clever campaigning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Blair had a 90&hyphen;seat marginal strategy in a voluntary voting system. He won 90 seats and more, as Senator Minchin knows. So the question of a marginal seats strategy, ignoring your base, is not valid. Senator Minchin knows that. You cannot afford to ignore your base, for two reasons. One is because we are senators and we need our base seats to turn out to vote for us. But it is not the impact in the safe seats; it is the ability to spread your resources in the most beneficial, professional way. Senator Minchin has proved he is a political professional; he knows about those things. The argument that compulsory voting leads to disenfranchisement in safe seats is a furphy. I hope that Senator Minchin will deal with some of the points I and other speakers have raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by saying that hankering after the monarchy in England is something that I have always found a bit amusing. I was born in England and grew up there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill with a few remarks because I think most of the opposition arguments can be dealt with in the committee stage. The only point I want to make is that this bill to set up an election system for the delegates to the convention is one to give effect to a policy for which we have a mandate. We went to the last election with a particular approach to the question of a republic, contrary to the then Labor government's approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were elected with an overwhelming majority. We have a mandate to give effect to the policy to deal with the question of a republic in the way we have proposed. That was quite clearly a policy for a constitutional convention at which half the delegates would be elected. We did not discuss in any way how that would be done; we said that we would have half the delegates elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes an election process which the whole of government believes is appropriate for this convention. You would think from the discussion we have heard from the opposition parties that we were talking about a bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to change the way the Commonwealth parliament and the Commonwealth government are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected. It is not. We are talking about the election of delegates to attend a 10&hyphen;day convention at the end of this year to discuss the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic. At the conclusion of the 10 days we all go home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking here about electing a government to govern the country or electing the parliament to represent the people of Australia. So we have treated this issue on its merits and designed an electoral system which we think is appropriate for this particular objective. We have, as you well know, as a government decided that the most appropriate method is a Senate&hyphen;style election which will be conducted by voluntary postal ballot. We will not be resiling from that; we remain committed to that being the election system to be used for the delegates to attend this 10&hyphen;day convention. As I say, despite what the opposition has been asserting, we are not talking about any change to the method by which the Commonwealth parliament is elected. That is an entirely separate matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition parties have proposed a whole range of amendments which essentially would have the effect of making it a compulsory attendance ballot and we will be opposing those amendments. There is a further set of amendments dealing with the method by which the other half of the convention delegates are to be appointed and we will also be opposing those. This bill deals with the election process for half the delegates, and that only. There is no need for a legislative prescription for the appointed delegates; that is a matter of government prerogative and will remain so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with the opposition arguments at the committee stage. I will just sum up at this stage by saying that we do have a clear mandate to establish a convention at which half the delegates would be elected. This bill gives effect to that policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing clause 11. I would indicate that the Democrats amendment No. 1 and the Greens amendment No. 4 seek the same outcome, which is to take out of the bill the voluntary voting proposal. This goes very much to the heart of what has been discussed extensively during the second reading debate, and that is whether we should have a voluntary vote. We reject the voluntary vote, and other amendments
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> later on will provide for an attendance ballot in the same way as attendance ballots are conducted for elections for the federal parliament. Other clauses later on will also provide for the attendance ballot to be conducted in the way that the normal Senate ballot is conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially this is the hub of the issue and it goes to the question of whether we should be endorsing, for this particular process, the concept of a voluntary vote. We on this side of the parliament are very strongly opposed to it for a number of reasons. We claim it is a breach of faith by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Before the election the Prime Minister made the assertion that, in terms of constitutional reform, all Australians had to be involved in all parts of the process: the beginning, the middle and the end. What this voluntary vote proposal does, together with a number of other proposals in the legislation, is disenfranchise many millions of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin claims that the government have a mandate. They may have a mandate for a constitutional convention, but they do not have a mandate to introduce voluntary voting, and they do not have a mandate to introduce voluntary voting with respect to this, particularly when the Prime Minister committed himself and his government to involving all Australians in this process. To claim that there is a mandate for this particular style of voting here or anywhere else is a distortion of the facts of history. You cannot rewrite commitments of the past here, as Senator Minchin quite often tries to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt the public have been desensitised on the issue. There has been limited publicity, and there will also be limited information available to them during any ballot. If you had been looking for a more effective way of reducing public participation in a process, you could not have designed a better proposal than the one embodied in this particular legislation. At best, on the average of attendances at voluntary postal ballots, voluntary ballots within local government and union elections, you can say that you can expect some 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the public to turn out, and I
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4454"> think that is a high estimation. Some 60 per cent to 65 per cent will not vote. That means more than seven million Australians, for one reason or another, can be expected not to vote in this particular ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with that, there will not be information sent out to every home in any language other than English, and there are some 2&half; million Australian homes whose first language is other than English. Those people will not participate fully in the process. For normal elections we have the capacity to assist those who are not literate, those who are old, those who have difficulties, those who might be impaired. We have all sorts of provisions to assist them through mobile booths or assistance at polling booths or electoral offices. Those polling booths, those mobile booths, will not be available this time. That assistance at the local suburban polling office will not be available this time either. People will have to travel a long way to get the assistance to which they should be due in this particular process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, there will be one office per federal electorate. In the past if you were living in the country and you wanted to register a vote but you had difficulties in doing so, you went to your local city hall, town hall or regional hall. You will not be able to do that this time. Levels and levels of Australians, in one way or another, will be excluded or will have difficulties placed before them in terms of their full participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter that concerns me. There has not been a habitation review and there will not be one before this ballot. There has not been one since the last election. Two million Australians change their address every year. What is the government's response to this? It is not just to have a voluntary postal ballot but also to close off the rolls one week after nominations close. If there was a way to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Australians did not have the capacity to correct their status on the rolls, it would be this measure that closes those rolls one week after the close of nominations. So, as I say, over seven million will not vote and probably more than
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 2&half; million will have difficulties placed before them in terms of voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you add to that the new system of voting, one that has been untried, and a proposal of government which is based on a rubbery costing figure. There is absolutely no way that this government can put all the information that needs to go out to the elector, and no way that this government will ensure it goes out to an elector, in the small sized envelope that they have asked us to believe they can. We know full well that, within days of any unamended legislation going through this parliament, the government will revise their figures and use a Tax Pack type proposal. Were they to use the envelope that they want us to believe they will use, the average elector would need a magnifying glass to read the details of the candidates.</PARA>

They claim it is cheaper. Their figures are rubbery. The envelopes and postage are going to cost more. There is no doubt from the evidence provided to the committee that the envelope that has been chosen by the government was not the first choice of the authorities involved in having to deliver these envelopes. The figures are rubbery there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They now have to add the cost of overseas voting, something we forced on them. A figure which started off being $53 million for an attendance ballot has been pared back to $49 million, as opposed to $35&half; million for a voluntary postal ballot. I think that differential is closer to $3 million or $4 million at most when you take into account the extra cost for the reasonable sized envelope that will have to go out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4455">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that sort of price should be inflicted on democracy. We are talking here about some 25c per elector&mdash;one&hyphen;quarter of the cost of a reasonable ice-cream. Senator Minchin reckons the cost is an important aspect. It should not be. Such a minimal cost should not be put between an elector and their right to participate in not just a normal election but a ballot that will determine possibly the constitutional structure of this country for the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken us 100 years to make radical changes to our existing constitution&mdash;and we have not succeeded so far. We are talking here of laying the constitutional framework for the future and this government says, `Well, $3 million or $4 million is important between a voluntary postal ballot and a normal attendance ballot.' They should take into account, for instance, that under the voluntary voting proposal you can expect, say, four million people to vote at a cost of $35 million, some 8&half;c a vote. Compare that with a normal attendance ballot, which would cost $49 million, say, for 12 million people voting, 4c a vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be twice as expensive per voter under your proposal, Senator Minchin, than under a normal attendance ballot. That approach does not rub with me and I do not think it rubs with the Australian public, a public which supports compulsory attendance voting. Some 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory attendance voting, and we have this measure, totally unprepared&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURRAY" NAMEID="3M6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And 74 per cent of politicians, though it may not be reflected in this particular ballot, Senator Murray. But 74 per cent, I would say, when you take into account those who dissent and disagree with Senator Minchin on the Liberal Party side and the Nationals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is an experiment in voluntary voting. The cat was well and truly let out of the bag earlier this week in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters&mdash;a report which had some members of the government recommending a voluntary vote. This is, no doubt, an experiment in that,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and an experiment which is contrary to the will of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does the government want to do it? It is quite obvious. All this is about is trying to grab that two per cent or three per cent advantage that Senator Minchin and others close to the Prime Minister think they can obtain from disenfranchising so many millions of Australian people. The government has not even had a joint standing committee inquiry into the issue of voluntary voting as a full inquiry but may have done some work in  passing. So you want to introduce this in the dark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that experimenting with voluntary voting now is the wrong time to do so. The outcome of this convention will be binding to the effect that it will decide the proposal to go to the Australian public. It is an important issue and resolution that this government wants to obtain from this convention&mdash;a constitutional one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the talk has all been about obtaining consensus. If you want to obtain consensus in this process, the last thing you should be doing is putting up a legislative structure that will force the different groups back to their constituencies to shore up their support behind their respective barricades. If you want to involve as many people as possible in educated debate, then that is enhanced by ensuring that people are engaged in the process. Your proposal will basically mean a hardening up of the two alternative sides. That will be their priority. The reality of the experiments with voluntary voting internationally is that it is very much back to the base and we have to try to build up the base and not spend money on it. In fact, organisations will not have the money to spend to engage the swinging voters&mdash;the people who should be engaged in this particular process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have concerns about security. It is clear that no extra resources will be allocated to ensure that the ballot is delivered in a secure manner. That was made apparent to the committee by postal authorities. We are talking here about a four-week ballot. The only way of ensuring that a person identified on the envelope is the person who voted is by using dates of birth. Give us a break! Dates
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4456"> of birth are so easily accessible. If you are an employer of a couple of people or a couple of thousand people, you will have their dates of birth. If you are the owner of a nursing home, you will have the dates of birth of anyone living in your nursing home. If you are the owner of a block of flats, you will have that sort of personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sort of personal information is so readily available to so many people. You are saying to us that that is your important measure to protect the security of the ballot. It just will not wash; it does not wash. Then the Electoral Commission says, `Well, we have the bar code.' But the bar code only identifies the envelope as a legitimate envelope for the Electoral Commission. That will not, despite the Prime Minister's eye glazing performance in his second reading speech on this matter, provide any extra security. The experience has been that there are security problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is placed at peril with this experimentation in voluntary voting is the secrecy of the ballot. The ballot slip will hang around in the envelopes in people's homes for some four weeks before they have to return them. When people will be susceptible to all sorts of discussions and so on, when they will not have the privacy of the ballot box&mdash;a privacy which is much cherished in Australian politics&mdash;then you cannot guarantee the secrecy of this ballot. Once again, this measure with these implications has been proposed without any public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say this particular proposal for constitutional reform is something that should be taken seriously. The only way to take it seriously is to ensure maximum engagement. This particular proposal before us ensures minimum engagement. Senator Minchin, if the government were to take it seriously, it would be spending the extra $3 billion or $4 billion, which is really the differential between the government's proposal and a compulsory attendance ballot, and ensuring that 95 per cent of the Australian public participate in it&mdash;not 35 per cent&mdash;and that more than the seven million people in the electorate expected not to vote do vote.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing here with the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue of voluntary voting. That is an absolutely critical issue to the debate because so many amendments will flow from the decisions that will arise therefrom. I want to commence my remarks by drawing your attention to the report of the inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee into the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. I want to refer you to my minority report and the last paragraph, which I was dismayed to have had to write. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I wish to express my intense dissatisfaction with a majority report which has failed to follow the normal Senate committee practice of receiving submissions and oral evidence and presenting a balanced and fair analysis of all the views put forward. The obvious bias and selectivity of the report does not, in my view, reflect well on the Chair, in this particular instance, and unfortunately significantly diminishes the credibility of the majority report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I turn to the minority report submitted by the Labor members in the same inquiry. They wrote the following right at the commencement of their report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before commencing our discussion of the Bill, we wish to express our grave concern at the approach taken by the Chairman, Senator Abetz, in preparing, and the members of the Coalition in supporting, the Chairman's Report. Unlike the tradition with reports from this Committee, the Chairman's Report does not provide a full and frank discussion of both sides of the issues arising out of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think those criticisms are very strong, and I will draw your attention to the inference I draw from them in a moment. First, I want to refer you to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was brought down this week. I want to quote to you from my minority report where I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation of the Majority Committee for the introduction of voluntary voting appears to be a recommendation for strategic partisan reasons. What is worse, the case for voluntary voting has been argued selectively in this report, lacks empirical integrity, and has been argued without attempting to balance the views of those who support voluntary voting with the alternative case. It is desirable for all Parliamentary Inquiries to receive submissions and oral evidence and present a fair and balanced analysis of all the views put forward, in their reports. With regard to this section this Report does not do so. For instance statements such as 3.4: `This opinion is shared by the Committee', is wrong and deliberately misleading. This is an opinion shared by the Coalition majority members of the Committee.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4457"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evident bias and selectivity of this section has unfortunately diminished the credibility of the voluntary voting arguments so presented.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In one or two respects we have the usual suspects transferring from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Those include me and Senator Abetz. We are diametrically opposed on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we see a common theme. What we see is that the voluntary voting argument is so badly put, so intellectually bereft and so morally weak in its arguments that it points to a real incapacity on the part of its supporters to express their argument cogently, with conviction and without fear. It is fear that drives them not to present both sides of the story. We are not afraid of that, but they are, and they exhibit that fear by the devious, manipulative and very poor arguments and methods they present. That is because this route is being pursued by Liberal Party strategists for reasons which have nothing to do with the moral arguments for voluntary voting and everything to do with the strategic advantage that they believe will accrue to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very simple. There are two or three components. The first is that a benefit of two or three per cent is computed to accrue to the Liberal Party as a consequence of voluntary voting. That, depending on whether you are dealing in marginal seats or not, can vary from four or five seats upwards. The second component is the anguish members of the Liberal Party have in failing ever to manage government on their own. A number of them resent being tied to the National Party&mdash;maybe a lot of them resent it, but I have only heard a number of them express their resentment. Voluntary voting may deliver them from the yoke of the National Party. That is another attribute they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In complete contrast to the opposition Labor Party&mdash;which has consistently gained government in its own right, as a single party with its own policies&mdash;the Liberal Party is incapable of gaining government in its own right. My belief is that one of their motives in introducing voluntary voting in this bill is to advance their cause, to the disadvantage of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> National Party. It is cynical, manipulative and very hard&hyphen;headed. We understand it. We know what you are about, Senator Minchin. We are in the political game. But I do not think you are going to be able to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public or the media or informed commentators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not afraid to have our arguments tested or to promote them. Let us turn to those areas in which we regard voluntary voting as delivering a far more favourable outcome in the democratic process. In doing so, may I add, incidentally, to the statistics with which we are assailed constantly and recognise that at least 10 per cent of the countries in the world now have some form of compulsory voting. To those who dismiss countries like Argentina and Brazil as just little places, I suggest that there are many people looking at compulsory voting with interest, including Fiji most lately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the arguments we outline in favour of compulsory voting. We say voting is the civic responsibility and duty of citizens in a democratic society and each citizen must take responsibility for how they are governed and by whom. We say compulsory voting ensures the expression of the choice of all those eligible to vote and not just of those who vote&mdash;and not just the majority of those who vote. Compulsory voting ensures, as far as possible, that parliaments are elected according to the wishes of all the citizens of a country. We say that compulsory voting materially assists in legitimising the entire electoral process and each parliament chosen by it: John Howard's coalition enjoys the legitimacy of the Australian people, because all the people are represented in the parliament&mdash;they all had the opportunity of voting in the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that social and political cohesion is promoted and alienation of the disadvantaged from the political process is diminished by compulsory voting. We say that compulsory voting ensures the representation of all community groups. We say that through compulsory voting citizens develop a sense of ownership of the political and decision making process. We say that compulsory voting contributes to civic education and the en
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4458"> trenchment of civic values and that, in elections where voting is compulsory, the focus is on the issues and the choices before the voters rather than on mechanisms to get people to the polls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that compulsory voting diminishes the opportunities for the exercise of corrupt, illegal and improper practices such as the buying off of members of the community during elections. We say that a compulsory voting system makes it extremely difficult for the practice of multiple voting to occur undetected. We say that the cost of elections is high for political participants and not having to get voters out&mdash;as has to be done for voluntary voting&mdash;saves expenditure which can be used for other campaigning activities. Compulsory voting has been with us for 80 years. It constitutes best democratic practice. It is a form of democracy which is to be desired and should be promoted internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should indicate whilst we are at it that the West Australian Commission on Government, appointed by Premier Richard Court, looked at this whole issue of compulsory voting. The Commission on Government has, without doubt, conducted one of the most extensive reviews of our political systems and principles this century. I say to Senator Minchin that they unequivocally recommended the retention of compulsory voting. The commission found that compulsory voting ensured the expression of the choice of the majority of the electorate which assists in legitimising the entire electoral process and the parliaments chosen by it. Page 316 of the West Australian Commission on Government, Report No. 1, August 1995, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A speaker at the Harvey public seminar reminded the audience of this State's experience of campaigning prior to the introduction of compulsory voting:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I'm old enough to remember when it wasn't compulsory voting. My family were very into politics in Harvey&mdash;it was May Holman's time&mdash;and I used to go around in cars with politicians and pick up voters. We only took our own people, our own party. We brought them back to vote.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a lot of dirty work going on in those days. You bribed people to come and vote for your party even though they didn't belong to your party. When compulsory voting came in, it cut out a lot of that. I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was only in my teens, but I knew a lot of it was going on. It was common knowledge. It was disgusting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us move forward with this matter. The additional cost of introducing compulsory voting has been computed at its highest at $18 million by the government, and they are likely to promote the highest figure possible. The figure that we have heard at the lower end, I think from Senator Bolkus, was about $9 million. We are talking about an additional cost of between 50c and $1 per Australian voter to retain a system which is our right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that your party, Senator Minchin, is split on this issue. We say that this is a divisive issue and we say that you are wrong to use this republican debate to promote it. We say that the disadvantage of a postal ballot is that it will disenfranchise the three million or so Australians who move house every year. We say that it will impact upon people from a non-English speaking background who find postal vote instructions too hard. There is no-one to assist them, as is normally the case. It will disadvantage students and young people who move around a great deal. As Senator Bolkus has clearly outlined, there are significant security concerns. Your only argument in favour of your proposal&mdash;your only cogent one&mdash;is cost. We think the cost is worth it. Democracy is expensive. Let no-one listening and no-one in this chamber misunderstand it. Democracy is expensive. It is worth paying for, it is worth fighting for and it is worth keeping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last item I want to cover is this: if this voluntary voting proposal goes forward, we see it unequivocally as the thin edge of the wedge. We will resist this in every form possible in every forum that comes before this House. Accordingly, I advise you that we will support the amendment put by Labor, which, as you know, is exactly the same as the amendment of both the Greens and ourselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend Senator Minchin for the way in which he has undertaken a very difficult task. It is not an easy  situation that he has been confronted with. He has done that with integrity and a great deal of expertise. As I indicated a moment ago, I was very thankful for the information that he
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4459"> provided to me and my office with respect to all matters relating to the current legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to think of what the current legislation is all about and what it intends to do. Simply stated, the legislation that is currently before us is about the establishment of a convention to consider whether Australia should become a republic, which republican model should be put to the electorate to consider against the status quo and in what time frame and under what circumstances might any changes be considered. It is a very limited area of consideration, but I suppose it is one of the arguments that has been put forward for voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to go back to the previous constitutional conventions and what they had on their plate and compare them to what has been proposed in this particular piece of legislation. In 1891 the delegates were actually appointed by colonial parliaments. Incidentally, the guiding principles in much of our deliberations here on these matters should be the guiding principles of democracy and federalism, which includes equality of states rights. In 1891 the delegates were appointed by the colonial parliaments. In 1897-98 the delegates were elected by the people in their respective colony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exception was the state of Western Australia which I found to be interesting, given what was alluded to by Senator Murray just a moment ago that only recently the commission in Western Australia indicated, I think unanimously, that there should be compulsory voting and that to establish voluntary voting in electoral matters would set a very bad precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1973 convention, which a number of us would remember, had 112 delegates, 72 of whom came from the states and were appointed by the parliaments of those states. Incidentally,  in that convention again you had equality of voting from each of the states. So it is a very interesting exercise to have a look at the history. But the overwhelming issue in respect of this particular amendment that is currently before us is whether or not there should be compulsory voting. The proposal before us is to oppose clause 11 which indi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cates that voting is voluntary, that a person is not required to vote at an election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to canvass all of the matters that have been raised by colleagues in this debate or outside. Quite frankly, I am concerned at the precedent that would be established if we voted for the government's proposition, that is to say, to entrench in legislation voluntary voting on a most important area for the future of this country. It does concern me; there is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to allude to one of the contributions made, that is, the contribution of Senator Cooney. I have always been interested in his contributions on debates such as this. I, too, am most concerned about the precedent that this might establish. The question is whether it is all worth it or whether the purposes of this particular legislation can be achieved by other means. As Senator Cooney said, if you are looking for people to make the decisions, then you look for people who have been elected to their responsible position to speak for the electorate. In the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997, that is not the case in a number of areas. For example, 36 of the delegates are going to be appointed. I hesitate to use the Whitlamese phrase of 36 faceless men, but it does come to mind. There would be a few around this chamber&mdash;not too many&mdash;who would remember that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems rather odd that this is going to be a polyglot type of convention. We are going to have some appointed and some elected, and those who are going to be elected are going to be elected by only a few. This is what this is all about. My view is that, if you are going to have an election, you have an election, and if you are going to have a popular election for direct appointment or election of delegates to the convention, you have it by the usual method of electoral voting, that is compulsory voting, which has stood the test of time, certainly over recent years, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the big problems that I think any government faces&mdash;I heard it the other day&mdash;is that by and large governments tend to  distrust electors. That is heartily reciprocated by the electors, generally speaking, after the election has taken place&mdash;it does not matter
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4460"> which government is in power. I am not saying that that is necessarily a bad thing. A healthy distrust in the sense of the need to be sometimes a little sceptical as to what governments might suggest is not harmful, provided that the expression of that is always positive and that persons can then exercise, both directly and through their elected representatives, some sort of control function over the elected government. That is precisely where we come in. As senators elected from the various states, it is our responsibility not only to represent the persons of the state but also a major function of this Senate is to exercise audit and control procedures over the elected government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the actual composition of the convention comes up, I will be making further comments. But here it is, I suppose, a narrow situation as to whether or not the principle of compulsory voting should be somehow undermined by this particular legislation. I fear that it would be undermined by this legislation. There would be a dangerous precedent set. I am aware that that is a view shared by persons right across the political spectrum. I am sure Senator Minchin and others would be aware that that is a view shared by quite a number of persons who are in the government parties. People have this concern about the precedent. I really am of the view that the Senate, at this stage, should adopt the amendment&mdash;that is, to delete the proposition in clause 11 which would entrench in Commonwealth legislation voluntary voting on a matter of such great importance to this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

To take maybe a lighter spin on it, one has to look to see just how Indonesian we are going to become with respect to the way this constitutional convention is appointed. I have had a little look through the bill to see whether the government will not be appointing the Leader of the Opposition for the purposes of this convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing you do is get rid of compulsory voting. The next thing you do is move
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to appointing a big slab of the delegates. General Suharto appoints a good slab of the parliament in Indonesia. He then puts a restriction on the parties that can vote and then of course determines who is going to lead those parties, as we saw when Megawati Sukarnoputri was bumped out by the government and somebody else was put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say, Senator Minchin, that I was taking a lighter look at this and wondering whether the government was not moving to an Indonesian style democracy, because you have two of the moves in place here. Of course, that is not the case. But we have, I submit, some aspects of democratic process in this country which are very important in ensuring that parliaments function as top&hyphen;rate democracies&mdash;that it is a case of one person, one vote, one value. This legislation moves us well back down the track and away from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the few countries in the world which have compulsory voting. The Americans very often put to me, at least when I am discussing this matter, their abhorrence of anything compulsory. But they are slowly moving to take up the Australian compulsion for seat belts, which have saved thousands of lives in this country and would have saved tens of thousands over there if they had adopted them when we did. There are many things that governments have to legislate for which require some compulsion for the benefit of the wider community. That is what rules and regulations are about. The point is, where do you draw the line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through a great period of debate earlier this century, the Australian legislators and people have come to regard compulsory voting as one of those very important, if not central, laws which put upon us not only rights but also responsibilities as citizens. Why should a constitutional convention, which is going to hopefully shape the political form in which Australia goes into the next century as part of the community of nations, be seen as second rate? Why should we be going back 70 or 80 years, as far as the former voting for this convention is concerned, and dropping the compulsion to vote? It does have an air of second&hyphen;ratedness about it. It is appearing to indicate that this convention does not matter
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4461"> all that much, or at least the outcome of the convention is not going to be as important as the outcome of the debates which take place in state or federal parliaments. I submit that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has determined there will be a convention. The convention is about whether or not we will have a republic and, if the Greens amendments are adopted, about a much wider look at how our constitution is shaped to equip Australia as a modern democracy in the community of nations. At the outset, to say, `We'll degrade the voting system. We'll let people vote if they do or don't want to. We'll make it a postal vote. You don't have to attend. We're worried about a few million dollars. We can give BHP $100 million on a platter in the diesel fuel rebate, but we're concerned that $9 million or $18 million is too much to put towards ensuring we have a first-rate compliance with the voting tradition in this country,' seems to me very odd indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am totally opposed to the government appointing delegates to this convention. The people ought to be voting for all the delegates to the convention. I am totally opposed to the degrading of the voting system so that it is, firstly, a postal vote and, secondly, a `vote if you want; vote if you don't want' system. The government is sending an indication to the people that this convention does not really matter. We have a long way to go, because people often cannot take out the time in their daily lives to understand the ramifications of things like constitutional conventions. We have a long way to go to bring home to many Australians the importance of this convention and their right to have a say. So it is very important for the government, having decided on this option, to be elevating in the public mind just how much each person's vote does matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not do that by saying, `Well, if you don't want to vote, don't worry about it. Skip it on this occasion.' That is a direct message that this vital part of shaping our democracy is not quite as important as the way democracy works through its parliament, and it is the wrong way to go. That is why the Greens have joined the Australian Democrats and the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition in putting forward the amendment which would do away with this second&hyphen;rate, non-compulsory aspect of the appointment of this convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will come to the other matters that I have spoken about a little further down the line, but the Greens are in favour of a fully elected people's convention which is able to not only determine whether or not we shall have a republic but put forward recommendations about how that republic should work and to upgrade and update and make more appropriate to Australia in the 21st century the constitution, which was written in the 19th century. It is a great opportunity. It is an historic opportunity. It should be elevated to the importance it deserves. It should be a people's convention, and it should be given the status that it deserves through having in place for that convention the usual voting process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out as well that we will be moving in the  committee stage to have at the same time as this vote is taken a plebiscite on what people think about the republic. The opinion polls show the majority of people want a republic. Let us have this convention discussing what sort of republic we should have rather than get bogged down in a debate between monarchists and republicans. Let us move to that stage. There is a money saver for the government: have the plebiscite first. Have the convention, having discovered what the polls are showing&mdash;that the people of Australia want a republic&mdash;and work on what form of republic they want instead of spending a lot of time debating what is good about the monarchy and what it is good about a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of Australians want a republic, let us face it, but let us confirm that through a proper plebiscite held at the same time as this vote for representation on the convention. Let us save millions of dollars in streamlining this process in that way rather than continuing with the current formula, which is to have a convention, a debate between monarchists and republicans, and then ask people afterwards what they want.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4462">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems as though this is being done back to front. It is clear to me that, if the government wants to save millions of dollars, it will reverse that order and give everybody a say on polling day about, first, whom they want to represent them at the convention and, second, whether or not they want a republic. Surely that is commonsense. Surely that is the sensible and logical way to be going, and surely if the government is concerned about dollars that is the option it should take up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment really relates to the deletion of the clause in the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill that we have specifically put in that voting be voluntary, that a person is not required to vote in an election. Of course, if the bill were silent on this matter voting would, by definition, be voluntary. You have to overtly require people to be compelled to vote if you wish to do that. But we did feel in relation to this bill that to put the matter beyond doubt we would specifically provide in the bill that voting be voluntary. We did it, frankly, coming from the perspective of a Liberal government. We are not the sort of party or government that abrogates the normal democratic rights of citizens without being convinced that it is absolutely necessary to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have treated this entirely on its merits. Of course, some on our side think that in relation to federal parliamentary elections it is regrettably necessary to abrogate the right of citizens to choose whether or not to vote, but even those people in the case of an election for delegates to a convention were not convinced that the right to choose whether or not to participate in this particular election should be abrogated by the parliament. We must remember that is what we are talking about: by virtue of making it compulsory, the normal democratic right of citizens to choose whether or not to participate in a particular election is taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By virtue of making participation in this election compulsory, Australians who choose not to participate will be guilty of an offence for which they could end up in gaol. After every federal election numerous Australians,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having exercised their fundamental democratic right to choose not to vote, do end up in gaol. So what we are proposing here is that, if Australians of whatever number do make a conscious decision that they are not prepared to vote for either Malcolm Turnbull or Lloyd Waddy, they could end up in gaol. That is the effect of making this particular ballot compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I respect the comments made by Senator Harradine, and I understand the argument that this is some sort of precedent, but we are not talking about a change to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. We are not talking about parliamentary elections. Voluntary elections are conducted across this country every day of every year&mdash;trade union elections, elections within political parties, elections in a whole range of civil organisations that make up the structure of this country, elections at the local government level. They are all conducted voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a feature of our federal parliamentary system that, since the early 1920s but not for the first 20 years of this democracy, it has been compulsory for people to vote. We put that to one side. We are dealing with this election of delegates to a 10-day convention on its merits, and I ask the Senate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Labor Party are, in my view mistakenly, absolutely terrified of voluntary voting because they believe, and I think wrongly, that they get a considerable advantage from people being forced to vote and they are terrified that their voters will be reluctant to turn out if they are not forced to do so by the power of the state. We can have that argument in relation to parliamentary elections, but we are not talking about a parliamentary election in this case. So I ask those opposite to put aside their terror and fear of people having the right to choose whether or not to vote in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, it is unduly authoritarian and paternalistic to force people to participate in this. I have used the public airwaves to say that the government will be doing everything it can to encourage all Australians to participate in this election. We will honestly and genuinely do so. We do want Australians to participate, but we are not prepared to pro
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4463"> pose or agree to a law which will make Australians guilty of an offence if they choose not to vote, and that is what you are asking for when you seek to make this vote compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also point out the somewhat paradoxical nature of your position. From the point of view of Labor, the Greens and the Democrats, this is about wanting a quite fundamental change to our constitution, but you are absolutely outraged because we propose that the election of delegates be done by a system slightly different to that which has been traditionally the case in parliamentary elections. I would suggest that is paradoxical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also point out that, in objecting to voluntary voting for the election of delegates to a convention, you are objecting to a system of election used by every one of the world's great democracies and one that was just used to elect&mdash;as I am sure you are thrilled to know&mdash;a British Labour government. It does seem to us to be utterly extraordinary that a system used in every major democracy cannot be used because it is so terrible and dangerous for the election of delegates to a convention. I assure you that we are dealing with this on its merits. It is not a proposition to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and I would ask the Senate to deal with it on its merits. The government proposes that the clause stand as printed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me briefly respond to some of the non-arguments that were presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, in what I felt was a rather feeble contribution on this particular issue because it is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Labor Party is concerned, I hear what Senator Minchin says about the international comparisons that he wants to make. I hear what he says about the United Kingdom election. I know in fact&mdash;though Senator Minchin did not say so&mdash;that Mr Blair was elected with the biggest majority in the United Kingdom since 1830. That is the truth of matter&mdash;the biggest majority in the United Kingdom since 1830; but he was also
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected with the lowest voter turnout since 1935.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course this is the nature of other political systems where the concentration is not on policies, not on the platforms of the parties and not on what is put before the electorate in terms of ideas and programs for government. The concentration in those systems is on getting the vote out. I do not accept the international comparisons. I am disappointed that Senator Minchin on behalf of Liberal Party of Australia would try to run those false arguments in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party are concerned about this proposal and we are concerned because we have always supported the Australian ballot. We are not ashamed of saying so. We are not ashamed of saying so because we believe that the Australian electoral system is the best electoral system in the world. We believe there is none better. We believe it is a tried and true system. We are proud of it. We are not ashamed of it. We&mdash;not only the Labor Party, but the whole community&mdash;have embraced it since the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1924. It is not just something the Labor Party cares about; it is something that all Australians care about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a traditional system of voting in this country&mdash;an Australian ballot&mdash;and we say very clearly that a voluntary, postal electoral process is un&hyphen;Australian. It is not something that Australian voters are accustomed to. It is not something that Australian voters want or are used to. This is an unnecessarily difficult and complex proposal that I believe has been deliberately designed to ensure that there is lukewarm response to the issue of constitutional reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this is a gross manipulation of the electoral process and we are not ashamed to say so. As far as we are concerned, this convention proposal for a non-compulsory postal ballot rigs Australia's electoral system. It rigs it against young people. It rigs it against people of non-English speaking background. It rigs it against people who do not live in the major capital cities. It rigs it against the poor and the more vulnerable in our society. It rigs it against the disadvantaged in our society and, for the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4464"> Labor Party's part, we are not going to stand by and allow that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Temporary Chairman, this is a proposition driven by certain Liberal Party apparatchiks and their motivation is pure political partisanship. I have also been a machine operator, like Senator Minchin, for the Labor Party. I know the background and I understand. He is arguing the case for a certain section of the Liberal Party, but I think that his sights are set far too low. This is about our electoral system, confidence in our electoral system and all of the Australian population having a capacity to participate in the Constitutional Convention. After all, it was Mr Howard who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will involve all Australians at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are about involving all Australians, as we always have been, in this process. We are about ensuring that people continue to exercise their vote as one of their obligations of citizenship&mdash;like paying taxes, going to school and obeying the laws of the land. Another community obligation that Australians accept is voting in elections and it is a tried and true method. It is the Australian way and it is for those reasons that the Labor Party so strongly opposes this proposition driven by political partisanship from the Liberal Party to abolish the compulsory voting system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I understand that there is an arrangement between the whips that will give me a little latitude on this speech. On 30 October last year I made a speech expressing concern about the views of the independent member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Today there remains a sizeable gap between the Hanson myth and the reality, a gap that demands exposure. A book published under the name of the independent member for Oxley is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pauline Hanson&mdash;the Truth</EMPHASIS> . If this book is the truth, why are the names of the authors conspicuous by their absence? Anonymity in this case implies shame and guilt, something to hide. How can concealment be part of the truth?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4465"> What else has been hidden from the Australian public under the populist mantle of One Nation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Hanson declined to be present at the parliamentary debate on racial tolerance, because she had business in Victoria. The truth is that she could not support the motion. The truth is that she let down the people of Oxley by not being in parliament to defend her views. The truth is that Ms Hanson spends a lot of time away from her electorate, despite saying at the declaration of the poll, `I will be concentrating on Oxley.' Later, she also said, `I will not be apologising for, or retracting, anything I have said.' The truth is that Ms Hanson spends so much time away because the media attention has convinced her that she is wasted in Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of remaining independent, as Ms Hanson promised many Australians at earlier meetings, she compromised her independence by forming her own party under her own name. There could be integrity in the Caroline Chisholm party or a Mary MacKillop party; but the Pauline Hanson party is arrogance indeed. The other part of its name, One Nation, is at direct odds with her claim that she would not fight for Aboriginal voters in Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 4 March 1996 reported that Ms Hanson said she was fighting for `the white community, the immigrants, the Italians, the Greeks, whoever; it really doesn't matter&mdash;anyone apart from Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders'. Thirty years ago the Australian people called overwhelmingly for the democratic franchise to be extended to all Australians, black and white. Today we have a political party leader who would rip up the level voting field and say that some votes are worth more than others. How does this fit under the banner of One Nation? It does not. Ms Hanson, on her own definition, is about two Australias, two nations: one white caucasian and one for everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Hanson is no down&hyphen;under Evita. What can she offer? Platitudes&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;but they do not get the job done. Does she still have the ear of ministers or a voice behind the cabinet door? No. Does she have some way of influencing government deci
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sions? No. The truth is that Pauline Hanson can do nothing. Since being elected in March 1996, Ms Hanson has contributed to the debate on legislation on three occasions. Two of these bills were related to child support and the other was on immigration. Is this the CV of a person who expects nationwide electoral support? The parliament has debated many important pieces of legislation covering industry policy, trade, industrial relations, regional and rural Australia and so on. Where was the voice of the people of Oxley?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the victims of her simplistic tirades that seek to appeal to our prejudice? Is it people who look different from her? From reading her speeches it is obvious that she has trouble with people who look different from her. There are several references to the way people look. In a speech to the Australian Reform Party on 12 October 1996 she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mainstream Australians must be allowed to have a say in how this country will look in a hundred years time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later in that speech she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The atrocities in Ireland and Bosnia appal us all but the really terrifying thing is that we see people who look like each other raping, murdering and blowing each other up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is conflict between people who look different terrifying because it to be expected and can be justified? The truth is that Ms Hanson fears Asians because they look different from her. This manifests itself in comment after comment designed to give Asians a bad name. Ms Hanson has referred to Asians in the context of drug pushers, disease carriers, ghetto formers and job stealers. The remarks about the dangers of being swamped by Asians conjures up the old frightening image of the yellow peril. What a great message to send to the children of Australia whom we wish to see grow up tolerant and unprejudiced. This is racism, pure and simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her strategy is to evade the truth by reducing current affairs into catch phrases that demand no brain power and no energy to digest. This is to let down and fail her supporters because it denies them understanding of reality&mdash;a reality that is full of complexities, trauma and variables beyond anyone's  control. We could all say we would like sales tax to be removed from Australian cars. Then
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4466"> responsible journalists would want to know where expenditure is to be slashed as a result. Would it be on drought relief, primary research and development, or government services in regional areas; or would we raise the Medicare levy? Perhaps we would just run up exorbitant deficits and turn ourselves into a financial basket case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia deserve the whole truth, not a self&hyphen;serving, rose&hyphen;coloured glasses vision. Anyone in this place could grab headlines by coming out with unrealistic, populist statements. What judgment prevents us? It is the judgment that says you will not be taken seriously in the long run, the judgment that says a platitude is no answer to the complex problems of today's changing world and, most importantly, the judgment that says it is wrong to escape responsibility by attaching blame to scapegoats, easily identified because they look or act differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unknown author of a paper in Pauline Hanson's book compares Kim Beazley's attitude to Asia as:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Most Australians would think this kind of talk is beyond the pale yet this is copyrighted to Pauline Hanson. I remind the Senate of Ms Hanson's assertions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program on 22 April 1997. She said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This book uses arguments from a paper by noted extremist Denis McCormack of Australians Against Further Immigration fame entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Grand Plan: Asianisation of Australia&mdash;race, place and power</EMPHASIS> . McCormack even claims to have proof&hyphen;read the Hanson book. A fellow AAFI candidate once said in a New South Wales election: `My policy on refugees and illegals is to reopen the second Yallah meatworks, creating up to 500 local jobs, and convert them to blood and bone.' Does Ms Hanson go along with Denis McCormack's arguments? She must. They are in her book. Are we to take it then that Mr McCormack

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the bloodthirsty ramblings about Aborigines, there are meandering fantasies about republics of Australia with a population of 1.8 billion people in the year 2050. The book says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australasia's new President is Poona Li Hung. Ms Hung, a lesbian, is of multiracial descent, of Indian and Chinese background, and was felt by the world government to be the most suitable President. She is also part machine&mdash;the first cyborg president.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reader is also told that the groundwork for a global gulag, a cosmopolitan police state, has already been `put in place' through international treaties and that `governments must comply with as surely as if the law were from Yahweh himself'. Does Ms Hanson believe that we live in a global gulag? She must, it is in her book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that Ms Hanson is brave in saying what ordinary Australians really think. I challenge that and I dispute that. Where are the tens of thousands who sit around their living rooms discussing the global gulag, a cyborg Asian lesbian president and comparing Kim Beazley's trade policy with child molestation? They do not exist in their thousands or in their hundreds and you would be flat out finding three or four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This article concludes by saying that Pauline Hanson is `one of the few politicians to even dare criticise the internationalist rule of Australia.' No wonder, therefore, that Ms Hanson has found fellow travellers in a variety of right wing extremists who explain everything in terms of international conspiracies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce Whiteside's contribution at the end of the truth book talks about `wresting our nation's destiny from those who pander to the  big A factor&mdash;the Asians and the Aborigines.' He wrote:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear truth which emerges from Pauline Hanson's book is that she supports race as a ground for discrimination. That is why she attracts the extremists. That is why National Action turns up to her meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will pay a terrible price if we follow the Hanson tune. Our children will suffer not only from an intolerant and prejudiced society, but also from lost export markets. Under a `fortress Australia' policy, we could not negotiate more open access in offshore markets. Jobs would go. Regional economies would come unstuck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent 26 years as a salesman and the best lesson I learnt was that you do not insult your customers if you want their business. That is the basis of any sales organisation. We produce a multibillion dollar surplus of agricultural goods. If we promote a bad image of our best customers&mdash;Asian buyers&mdash;what will we do when they knock our goods back? Where will Pauline Hanson sell our primary industry goods?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must realise that Asia is the market for 74.5 per cent of our minerals and fuel exports&mdash;some $11.6 billion worth. Asia is the market for 53.6 per cent or more than $13 billion of our manufacturers' exports. Asia buys 69.9 per cent of our primary product exports. We export over $11 billion of primary products to Asia. Over two&hyphen;thirds of the export product at the farm gate goes to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supermarket to Asia Council recently predicted that food exports to Asia would jump by 60 per cent to $16.4 billion during the five years to 2000&hyphen;01. A vote for Pauline Hanson is a vote to cut the throat of the bush. It should fall to our regional communities and farm leaders to demand that Ms Hanson stop endangering our markets and our reputation in Asia. If Ms Hanson is only saying what

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no panacea for life's problems. There is no political messiah who can come in and turn everything around. For those who are tempted to believe that Ms Hanson is value for their vote, I ask that they carefully scrutinise the company that she keeps and the statements that she supports. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth book is not a collection of sayings from the man in the street. It is the ramblings of a political opportunist and some disturbed minds. Hanson and One Nation claim that they have nothing to do with extremist groups such as the League of Rights.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm streetwise enough to spot them and get rid of them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the facts are that Pauline Hanson's One Nation not only harbours and promotes extremists as office bearers and potential candidates, but it advertises in the anti&hyphen;semitic, racist and extremist rag, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Strategy</EMPHASIS> . Along with pages of glowing editorial, Ms Hanson's party has taken a half page ad soliciting for membership and donations. This was not done months ago when she was a naive politician.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Strategy</EMPHASIS>, Ray Platt, organised the visit to Australia of the US militia extremist, Jack McLamb. McLamb's business partner, Bo Gritz, had stood as a Vice&hyphen;presidential nominee on the ticket of former Ku Klux klansman, David Duke. McLamb and his associates have featured prominently in American press profiles of groups with similar conspiracy theories as the Oklahoma bomber, Timothy McVeigh. McLamb was described as `one of the nation's most militant militia organisers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, one of the contacts for McLamb's Australian tour is Peter Archer. And Tony Pitt pops up again reviewing McLamb's Brisbane visit on behalf of meeting organisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is the One Nation organiser and would&hyphen;be candidate in Newcastle? The very same Peter Archer. Archer was for a long time on the staff of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Strategy</EMPHASIS>. In 1994 Archer addressed and helped organise a forum, which featured a line&hyphen;up of distinguished extremists including the national director of the League of Rights, David Thompson, and Joe Bryant&mdash;who may be remembered for championing the spurious claims of the self&hyphen;styled duke and duchess of Marlborough.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Archer describes the events as follows:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Not only does Ms Hanson sell her wares in the nation's most notorious far Right newspaper, but she recruits her organisers from its staff. Archer is also self&hyphen;published. His book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Crisis</EMPHASIS>  crudely summarises a variety of one world government conspiracies. Archer pays special thanks to none other than Jeremy Lee, former deputy national director of the League of Rights. The book endorses material from Jeremy Lee, Peter Sawyer, a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Sawyer tried to tell us that this parliament house was built to a satanic occult design and that George Bush was the head of a child molesting ring. Archer's paranoia reaches to the country music industry. About the singer John Williamson, he says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, Pauline Hanson thinks that Archer is prime One Nation material. Are his heroes also hers? The Peter Sawyers and Jeremy Lees? Are his conspiracy theories and paranoia also hers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned Tony Pitt as a writer for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Strategy</EMPHASIS>. His latest role is as the secretary of `The Bay' One Nation group in Queensland.

Pitt used to be press secretary for the confederate action party which disintegrated, following claims of fraud, unethical conduct and finances not accounted for.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pitt was also press secretary to the extremist gun lobby group, the Firearm Owners Association, serving alongside Ron Owen, the publisher of yet another extremist rag, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that Ms Hanson, far from distancing herself and her party from these extremists, is making them feel welcome. As with all populist movements, the great majority of supporters have no idea of the hidden agenda of some of the key people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rising today, I want to address another problem. It is a problem that has taken my interest and time over many years and has used up many hours of my time in pursuit of it. I refer to the whole issue of whistleblowing. On Monday, 26 May, Tuesday, 27 May and Thursday, 29 May 1997 I made a number of speeches supporting the contention that there ought to be whistleblower legislation within the federal parliament. In support of those speeches, as I understood at the time, I tabled some documents on Thursday, 29 May 1997&mdash;documents supplied to me by Dr De Maria of the University of Queensland. I was unaware that they contained very adverse comment about certain staff within the University of Queensland. I take responsibility for the fact that I had not checked those documents carefully enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The documents spelt out Dr De Maria's side of the argument in what were long&hyphen;running disputes between Dr De Maria and a number of staff within the Department of Social Work in the University of Queensland. In fact, I underline that these have been long&hyphen;running disputes and that they are between Dr De Maria and I would say most of the staff of that department. I have discovered since that Dr De Maria has no support amongst the staff within the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to apologise to the Senate and to those involved that I did not check carefully enough the contents of those tabled documents. I want to apologise especially to Professors Ian O'Connor and Linda Rosenman, to the staff, including Peter North, Susan Tasker and Judith Strachan, and to students who have complained about Dr De Maria's attitude and behaviour. I spent many hours talking to University of Queensland staff about their concerns, which I felt was only fair. I am convinced of the integrity of those to whom I spoke, particularly those whom I have already listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair that I should seek leave to table a number of documents which would put the other side of the argument and answer those adverse comments. So that the Senate
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4473"> is aware, I list these documents as: a letter from Professor O'Connor, in support of the staff of the university; a letter from the academic staff in support of Professors Ian O'Connor and Linda Rosenman and in support of other staff&mdash;that letter contains over 20 signatures&mdash;and my letter to the University of Queensland explaining how the tabling came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole incident has caused me quite a deal of  distress and a lot of concern. My concern about the situation of whistleblowers in Australia continues. The tragedy is that this dispute clouds the work done by so many sincere whistleblowers. I hope that I will be able to revive my rather dented enthusiasm for pursuing whistleblower legislation in the federal parliament. I seek leave to table the documents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Constitutional Convention draws closer, more attention has been given to the debate over whether the Commonwealth should become a republic and whether we should have an Australian head of state to replace the Queen of England. This is an issue not only about our national identity but also about our national maturity. This issue is about whether we believe that our nation has come of age and whether we as a nation should take ownership of our political affairs and have an institution for a national head of state which embodies the democratic and egalitarian values of Australia rather than continuing with the British monarchy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a matter of such importance to our nation's future, I believe that the debate on whether or not we should have an Australian head of state should be conducted in a mature and rational manner without deception and scaremongering. Unfortunately, there is growing evidence that those who support the continuation of the British monarch in Australia are not committed to rational debate on the question of whether we should have an Australian head of state. For example, I was appalled by the recent action of the Longford branch of the Tasmanian RSL in putting one
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of their members on trial for voicing his support for an Australian republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always thought that the RSL represented the men and women of Australia who fought and died for the preservation of democracy and freedom of speech. Yet last Friday in Tasmania, Mr Mick Walker, a member of the RSL for 51 years&mdash;a World War II veteran&mdash;was put on trial for his views about supporting the concept of an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the kind of intimidation the Nazis and communists practised. It is certainly the last thing I would have expected from the RSL. In my opinion, the Walker trial dishonoured the thousands of Australian men and women who have given their lives fighting to preserve Australia's tradition of freedom of speech and democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is surely a very sad matter that an RSL veteran should have been intimidated in this way for expressing support for Australia having an Australian head of state. I thought our service men and women fought and died under the Australian flag for Australia. I can only say that the RSL has lost a lot of credibility because of the shameful trial that Mr Walker was put through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most misleading statements that has been put about which is of concern to ex&hyphen;service people is that the Republican Movement wants to change the Australian flag. There is no truth in this claim at all. Speaking as the co&hyphen;patron of the Australian Republican Movement in Western Australia, I would like to reassure the ex&hyphen;service men and women of Australia that the ARM has no policy about changing our national flag. I understand that, to ex&hyphen;service people, the flag they fought under is sacred and represents our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter I wish to address in this vein is the claims by Australians for a Consti tutional Monarchy, or ACM as it is known, that the Republican Movement does not know what it stands for or what it wants. This is simply not true. The position of the ARM is very clear and simple. The ARM supports, firstly, creating an Australian institution reflecting the democratic and egalitarian values of Australian society for a national head of state to replace the British monarchy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4474"> in Australia. Secondly, the office of the head of state, or president, would be largely ceremonial. Thirdly, the ARM supports the retention of the Westminster system of parliamentary government, with the Prime Minister and cabinet coming from the parliament. Fourthly, the ARM would want Australia to still be called the Commonwealth of Australia. Fifthly, the ARM supports continued membership for a republican Commonwealth of Australia of the British Commonwealth&mdash;that is, we would still remain members of the British Commonwealth; Australia would still compete in the Commonwealth Games; and of course, we would still play cricket. Sixthly, and finally, Australia would still give continued recognition to the Queen as head of the British Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public draft of the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy statement that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 May 1997 and that will be circulated for the Constitutional Convention also contains some grossly misleading statements. Such statements were obviously deliberately included to confuse the Australian people. For example, the ACM statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Republic will put at risk what we now enjoy: our political stability, our national flag and our national anthem. In other words, Australia as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All I can say about that is that it is absolute and utter, irresponsible nonsense. The claim that our political stability will be at risk if the Commonwealth becomes a republic is absolute rubbish when one considers countries such as Germany, India and Ireland. They are all parliamentary republics of the kind that it is proposed by the ARM that Australia should become. All of these countries enjoy political stability, and there is no question that a republican Commonwealth of Australia would not be politically stable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's political stability does not depend on having the Queen of England as our head of state. Australia is one of the most mature democracies in the world, and our traditional commitment to democracy will continue whether Australia becomes a republic or not. Becoming a republic will only mean that the symbol at the top will change
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and our basic political system of Westminster style parliamentary government will remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy statement that our national anthem will change is also complete nonsense. The Australian national anthem is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> and was chosen by the people of Australia back in the 1970s. There will be no change in our national anthem if Australia becomes a republic&mdash;unless, of course, the monarchists are referring to the use of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS>, which demonstrates how out of date they are and illustrates, as nothing else could, that the monarchists are clinging to the past, the last of the British Empire loyalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that if Australia becomes a republic there will really be no change at all to our way of life. For example, nothing in our legal system will materially change, except that it will be the state rather than the Crown that the law is administered in the name of. Nothing in the way we are governed will change. The Westminster system of responsible parliamentary democracy will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only significant change will be that instead of having the Queen of England we will have a distinguished Australian as our head of state. After all, that is the whole point: we are Australians and we should have an Australian head of state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. However much the monarchists might like to pretend otherwise, the truth is that in the wide world out there, the Queen is regarded as the Queen of England, not the Queen of Australia. When the Queen travels to other countries, the headline in the local papers is not `The Queen of Australia visits New York'&mdash;or Paris, or Tokyo. Instead, Her Majesty is referred to as the Queen of England visiting New York, Paris or Tokyo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely Australia has reached a point in our national maturity where it is important for us to have a recognisably Australian head of state. This is the view of Richard Woolcott who was the former head of the Department
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4475"> of Foreign Affairs and formerly Australian Ambassador to the United Nations. He wrote last year about the confusion caused by having the Queen of England as our head of state. Mr Woolcott's experience was that many countries around the world questioned whether Australia is really an independent country and whether we really control our own foreign policy when we have the Queen of England, clearly the head of another country, as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Woolcott also made the point that when the royal family travel overseas the British government uses them to promote British commercial and trade interests. This means that there have been times when our head of state, the Queen, and members of the royal family have been working against Australian trade interests. With regard to that, I would like to quote the former deputy chairman of the British Conservative Party, Lord McAlpine, who, in an article in a recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The monarchy is thoroughly good for Britain and should continue. However, it does nothing for the Australians. Take the simple proposition of a State visit to Japan. The Queen goes there to sell Britain, and often her visit will be timed to coincide with British trade missions . . . She does not promote Australian trade interests in Japan or anywhere else. The monarchy is a thing of the past in Australia; Australia will never truly be a nation while the monarchy lasts there.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said in the beginning, I hope the republic debate will be conducted in a mature and sensible manner. Debate should be conducted in an open forum style with respect for the opponent's point of view, and there should be respect for freedom of speech and, in the end, respect for majority rule. The forthcoming Constitutional Convention should be seen as an opportunity for the views of all Australians to be represented and I trust that the consensus that will emerge from the Constitutional Convention will be respected.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4475"><TITLE>Acquired Brain Injury</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to speak about something that deeply concerns me, and that is the large number of people who are disabled by acquired brain injury both in my home state of Queensland and around Australia. It is not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> just the large number of people who are afflicted by this condition which concerns me; it is especially concerning because these people receive very little access to services and support and no government department wants to own them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those not familiar with people who have ABI, it may be important to briefly discuss the unique nature of this type of disability. Many people who acquire a brain injury do so in road accidents and on rural properties. These include horse, motorcycle and machinery accidents. The worst aspect of this is that the support services are virtually non&hyphen;existent in rural areas. Another aspect of ABI is that there are many young sufferers. Of all people with a disability arising from ABI, the proportion in the 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age group is higher than in any other age group below 75.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent letter to me the Executive Director of Headway Queensland stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before this year is over, we can expect to see an additional four thousand (4,000) names added to the list of Queenslanders disabled by acquired brain injury. Unfortunately, services available to support them are virtually non&hyphen;existent. Not only are there no services for people with acquired brain injury, it is impossible to find a Government Department to acknowledge responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The situation is little better for the rest of Australia, bar one or two state governments that have started to tackle the problem. The CEO of the Head Injury Council of Australia said that, on very conservative estimates, 254,500 people in Australia are seriously affected by ABI or strokes and suffer long&hyphen;term problems. If we add to this figure the less serious cases, the total is 500,000. Remember that these are conservative figures only, and the Head Injury Council of Australia has good reasons to believe that the numbers are in fact much higher. Why then does no&hyphen;one want to take responsibility for this very large group of people? Why are young  people being placed in aged care hostels when that both is inappropriate and does not allow for the appropriate support services? And why is there a dearth of support services for people with ABI?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the report of the strategic review of the Commonwealth disability services
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4476"> program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working solutions</EMPHASIS>, written by Kathleen Kay and Professor Peter Baume. This report illustrates quite clearly the very small impact that the disability services program is having on people with ABI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the various employment services funded by the DSP, people with ABI were able to access only two per cent. This small, two per cent figure translates to 582 people who were assisted. Out of a quarter of a million people with serious cases of ABI, that is just 0.2 per cent of their number. I have to say that that is an abysmally low level of support for a group of people who are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in number when compared with other groups with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it into context, there are 3.2 million people&mdash;18 per cent of the Australian population&mdash;who have a disability. Eight per cent of this number experience disability caused by brain injury. Unfortunately, when compared to assistance to all states, my home state of Queensland has access to fewer services than the general state population would warrant. At the same time, Queensland has a higher percentage of people with ABI than other states. Queensland, therefore, is losing out both ways, in an area which is already neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have outlined some of the figures that relate to a definite lack of access to employment services for people with ABI. However, another very important aspect is the need for support services immediately after the incident where people first suffer the brain injury, as well as the counselling and support services for the family. People suffering from ABI are often not aware of the problems they are suffering. This is something unique to this type of injury, because these people were functioning quite well before their accident. Subsequently, with only a part of their brain injured, they often cannot see that they are acting differently or are not able to do things as they did before. In some cases, the families, unfortunately, cannot recognise the problems either. The problems often manifest themselves through frustration, anger and aggressive behaviour by the victim, and this can do a great deal of damage within a family.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I use my state of Queensland as an example, there is just one hospital that has a specialised unit for people with ABI. I am informed that it does excellent work. Unfortunately, though, it can cater for just 140 cases per year, when there are 2,500 cases per year that need the service it provides. Therefore, more than 2,300 cases per year, out of the 2,500, receive no diagnosis of any psychiatric disorders that may require treatment. As I pointed out before, many of the sufferers are not aware that they have any problems. Subsequently, there is no education or counselling for the families either. This is a very serious problem and needs to be changed as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these problems, the government is now reviewing the need to fund advocacy services. The Head Injury Council of Australia can employ only two people with the federal funding they receive. This takes 90 per cent of their income. It is essential their funding is renewed after 30 June this year. Otherwise, who is going to fight for the recognition of the services for people with ABI? Remember: people with ABI make up just two per cent of those assisted with the disability services program employment schemes. Without an advocacy service to assist these people and fight for them, what percentage will be able to access services in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to point out the inappropriate actions that occur when a group of people is not formally recognised by a responsible government department and where necessary services are not available. In New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia and the ACT, young people with ABI are inappropriately accommodated in acute hospital beds, aged care nursing homes, aged hostels or the mental health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally inappropriate for young people to be accommodated in aged care accommodation around the country. One can only guess how many are in hospitals or in the mental health system. It raises many concerns because the potential of these young people is never reached due to the fact that support
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4477"> services are not available. People with a disability such as blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy, and other groups who have been recognised for decades or centuries, have a much higher level of direct funding. I certainly do not want to take anything away from these sectors. However, those with ABI are always last in the queue and are therefore restricted in access by budgetary limitations. It is time that the government started to implement the recommendations of the Baume report that will make access more equitable for all of those with disabilities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, if you look at the make&hyphen;up of unemployed youth, you will see that the quickest way to ensure that someone is unemployed and looking for work in the short term, and remains unemployed for a long period of time and faces a very bleak future, is to say to them, `Why don't you leave school at the minimum age? The government does not express any view about whether you do more training. We do not have extra incentives&mdash;in fact, the incentives are there for you to just look for work and we will pay you the unemployment benefit.'

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4478">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obviously true that, when you rejig incentives, there are winners and losers. It is quite clear that students around Australia are the winners under this proposal. The benefit is that, over the long term, there is an incentive for young Australians either to stay at school and complete their year 12, which increases their opportunities for getting a job, or to leave school early because school is not appropriate for them to continue with. We could have another debate about that&mdash;schools focusing themselves on the 25 per cent who want to go to university and not paying enough attention to those who want to go into vocational education and training. We have some reforms that are affecting the schools in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be an incentive. It is about time somebody said to young Australians, `This is a bad thing for your to do. It is a bad thing for you and for your future to leave school at the earliest possible age and not do further training.' You were happy to let them do that and leave them with a very bleak future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, you would understand that, with the changing industries, the availability of jobs to low and unskilled workers is diminishing. The sorts of jobs that kids who leave school early can get are in shorter and shorter supply as the economy internationally changes into higher-tech and service industries. Senator Cook knows that. I have heard him talking about it on many occasions when he was on this side of the chamber. You guys were too gutless to rejig the incentives in favour of young Australians, to give them an incentive to do more education and training. Now you have the cheek to come in here and complain about what we are doing. You must be crazy.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. Minister, in 1995, with Senator Ian Campbell and other coalition members, I participated in a series of youth forums in New South Wales and Queensland. The No. 1 concern of many young people was the fact that they could get more money in their pockets being on the dole than they could get from Austudy. They asked why they should study if they were paid more not to work. Minister, how does the government's new youth allowance address this disincentive to study and what other benefits will the youth allowance have for young Australians?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that we have an intelligent question about a most important social policy reform, probably one of the most important reforms in social policy areas in decades&mdash;and badly needed, as Senator Payne has pointed out. This government's highest priority is to provide young people with jobs. The youth allowance is designed to achieve just that by encouraging young people to go for more education and training so that they are less likely to end up on the dole. The fact is that the early school leavers are three times more likely to end up unemployed than are those who leave at year 12.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that the previous government seemed to focus on academic achievements for the handful who will go on to universities.

This is long overdue, as Senator Payne mentioned, and desperately needed by all young people, but it is particularly valuable for those who live in country areas, who come from the bush. It will be up to a hundred dollars a fortnight more in the pockets of a family with a young person who is going on to education. I would have thought that was a message that the Labor Party would not want to hear. Clearly that is why they are trying to make such a din now.</PARA>

Secondly, Minister, can you confirm that you are currently allocating some 20 per cent of the vocational education budget for the so-called new apprenticeships? Is it not true that KPMG has found the need to increase the budget by some 30 per cent to 40 per cent to properly fund the expected growth, specifically in traineeships?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly assure the Senate that the sale of AN is very much supported by the workers and by many other groups who have a very keen interest in the outcome. AN workers have been calling for the sale of AN to go ahead for quite some time. They understand that the future for all AN workers depends on the sale of AN and on the injection of private sector enterprise and investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in Tasmania there is also an acute awareness of how crucial the sale is to Tasmania's rail industry and freight transport generally. The sale there is supported by the Tasmanian government, the unions and even the Tasmanian Labor Party. It is certainly supported by AN workers in Tasrail, who realise that if the sale does not go ahead then there will not be a railway left to sell. Tasrail's major customers, like Goliath cement, are also very supportive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, Rail 2000, the TLC of Port Augusta, the corporation of the city of Port Augusta, the Spencer Region Development Association, the Northern Regional Development Board, the SA Farmers Federation, the Australian Barley Board, the Australian Wheat Board and AN itself all very much support it. Indeed, the State Secretary of the Public Transport Union, Rex Phillips, warned recently that any delay to the sale would cause `unneeded heartache and grief for workers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, one ought to ask oneself, `What is the attitude of the Labor Party?'&mdash;apart from talking amongst themselves and pretending that this is not an issue that they have to face. The fact is that they do have to face it. What they are doing now is putting themselves on the record as being opposed to something that is in the interest of not only the workers but the people of Port Augusta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the response of the Leader of the Opposition? He sent Mr Tanner, the opposition spokesman, to Port Augusta the other day to try to defend the indefensible. What happened there as a result of that was an interview on Radio 5CK yesterday with an AWU
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representative. He made clear that this was absolutely devastating as far as they were concerned. He said, `I must say, as much as it hurts me, that after Lindsay's visit we are even worse than we were before.' He was asked, `Did you get any guarantees from the minister?' He said, `No guarantees at all. To see our own people coming out and endorsing the blocking of the sale sort of left us with a bit of egg on our face.' What he really meant was an omelette the size of a satellite dish. He was just being polite to people he thought used to be his friends. He was asked, `Do you think there was any point in the visit at all?' He said, `Going on that, no. A lot of our people asked, "Where's Lindsay been over the last 18 months?"'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Mr Tanner may well be the victim of some vicious infighting on the part of the Labor Party, who clearly want to see the young turks knocked off by the old turkeys who are in the leadership group at the present time, who read his speech on populism and rationalism and who understand that there is nothing in that that offers the old guard any encouragement. It certainly offers the people of Australia some glimmer of hope, but it says nothing about privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, ask yourself, `Why is that?' The answer is sitting opposite&mdash;28 of them, 18 belonging to the trade union movement; in other words, two-thirds. Since May of 1995, that is over two years ago, eight out of eight have been trade union members. That side of the chamber looks like a branch meeting of the Canberra branch of the ACTU. The only difference, of course, is that the delegate fees are paid by the taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As long as the Labor Party thinks that the interests of the trade union movement, of which it is a wholly owned subsidiary, ought to be put ahead of the people of Australia, then it will continue to find itself not only languishing in the polls but also being ridiculed for its policy position on these issues. You only have to look at what is going on over there to see that this crowd has absolutely no interest at all in policy issues. They are interested in vicious infighting. They are interested in jockeying for position. They are interested in ensuring that some people's

This is the bloke who is very good at mea culpas! He said that we doomed AN to failure in government. The Mayor of Port Augusta was giving evidence. Senator Calvert asked, `What would be the effect if the Senate were to block the sale of AN?' The mayor said, `I refuse to believe senators are that dumb.' Senator Collins asked, `How many of them have you met?' The mayor said, `Well, I've met you, dear.' So I do not think you will be holding on to that seat for much longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In actual fact, in recent years our improvement has bettered that of most of the European states, so our position is far from appalling. The fact that it has improved vis-a-vis the European states demonstrates a commitment within the Australian community to a better greenhouse outcome. I particularly commend Australian industry, who have cooperatively agreed with the government to programs that will produce a better domestic greenhouse outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is consistent with the government's objective of contributing to a better global outcome. We accept that. Australia produces about only 1&half; per cent of the world's greenhouse gases, so we are really insignificant in terms of the total global picture, but our per capita output is quite high and we believe that it can be improved. That is why we are working cooperatively with industry to produce a better result in that regard. In producing a better result in that regard, we will be making a contribution to a better global outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is consistent with our overall approach to the greenhouse issue, and that is, yes, we must contribute fairly but we must also recognise that jobs and economic growth are important to Australians as well. If we are being asked to contribute unfairly&mdash;in other words, if we are being asked to accept that Australians should take a greater personal loss than Europeans or some other states&mdash;then we regard that as an unfair solution. As a matter of interest, we also regard it as unworkable. That is why we have said that the conclusion to the Berlin mandate process must be to an outcome which is fair and achievable. We are wedded to that. We think that not only is it fair but, being achievable, it will produce a better global greenhouse outcome as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So our position is valid and will continue to be supported by this government. I know that some other states can take different positions.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Britain can take a different position because it has been benefited by closing down uneconomic coal mines. Our coal mines are the most economically viable in the world. This is what Australia does well. That is why if you impose a penalty that forces a burden on us in that regard but not on others the cost to all Australians would be so much greater.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 June 1997, Senator Collins asked me, as the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, you are no doubt aware that the Northern Territory police have just paid $440,000 of money levied from taxpayers under the national gun buyback scheme to an individual for 22 Second World War 2 millimetre Hispano-Suiza aircraft cannons which were illegally imported into Australia, which must have seemed like Tattslotto for the owner. You may also be aware that the gun curator of the National War Memorial, Mr Peter Aitken, has stated publicly that `millions' of these old cannons are lying on scrap heaps around the world. The responsibility for this farce has been laid squarely at the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> feet of the Commonwealth government by the Northern Territory Chief Minister and Minister for Police, Shane Stone. Is the Chief Minister correct in his public assertions? Is the Commonwealth responsible for this? If so, can you explain to the levy payers why their money was spent in this way?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General has provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Questions regarding the importation of prohibited goods should be directed to the Minister responsible for Customs. The question of whether any alleged illegality has occurred with respect to the cannons to which the Honourable Senator referred yesterday has been referred by the Northern Territory to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. In accordance with usual procedure, the AFP has in turn referred the matter to the Australian Customs Service. Pending the outcome of any inquiries by those bodies, it is inappropriate for me to offer any comment on whether or not the aircraft cannon which were the subject of the Honourable Senator's questions were in fact illegally imported into Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposi tion in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) today, relating to the proposed Common Youth Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The official announcement of the youth allowance last night is somewhat overdue. The original announcement of this scheme was last August, in the budget. We have to ask ourselves why it is that that announcement was repeatedly delayed. It is quite
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4493"> apparent that there was considerable tension within the government, particularly between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. What we have seen is a continual turf battle between the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), a turf battle in which Senator Newman ultimately came up trumps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you find is that Senator Vanstone was not even at the cabinet meeting when these final decisions were actually made. What you find is that Senator Vanstone is a victim of the classic tory trick&mdash;which is, rather than sack ministers, they actually strip them of their responsibilities. What we have seen is that this minister's responsibilities are slowly but surely being stripped away. She is being off-loaded with Minister Newman and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, the beneficiaries. Even her parliamentary secretary is in for the chop in such a way that the benefits of her demise will be reaped within this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this so-called revamped youth allowance, the government's claim is that this is not a savings measure. It says it is seeking to make the youth allowance simpler and more flexible by replacing some five different benefits with one and by reducing the current 14 rates to five rates. If all of that is true, then the government is to be commended. If, as the government assert, it is seeking to remove disincentives for people to undertake further study, that is to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very high level of retention rates of students at school which were achieved under the Labor government have been reversed under this government. Retention rates under this government are falling. The number of students staying on at school is falling to alarming levels, and this demands immediate attention from this government. What we have seen from this government is not real attention. What we have seen is not resources being put behind demands for people to get off the dole. What we are seeing is this government taking away resources.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that it is spending an additional $25 million for this particular program. What it does not say to you is that some 112,000 people between the ages of 18 and 20 will have no benefit whatsoever from this package. A total of 33 per cent of the people currently receiving assistance&mdash;nearly 50,000 people&mdash;will in fact receive a reduction in payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Minister Newman doubting my words. What I said, and I will repeat it, is that 112,000 people will get no benefit out of this package whatsoever and 50,000 people will actually get reductions in benefits&mdash;that is, 33 per cent of the persons currently receiving assistance will receive a reduction in benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than the additional $25 million the government claims is being spent, what we ought to look at is what the government said in its budget papers. What its budget papers highlight is that some $513 million has been taken away from student assistance. Is that being restored, Minister? Of course not. What we have seen is $65 million in savings in 1997, $138 million in 1998, $151 million in 1999 and $160 million in the year 2000&mdash;a total of $513 million taken away from student assistance. How much of that is being restored by this package? It is yet another con trick by this government&mdash;a totally deceptive presentation of what is actually occurring in this budget, as distinct from what this government says is occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at the additional strain that is being placed on the TAFE and school systems as a result of this government's actions. What we see is that the resources to cope with that demand are not being increased. The programs in TAFE are terribly underfunded. In schools, resources are actually being taken away from public education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the issues in terms of additional support for families, we do not see anything in this budget. What we see is additional pressures being put on families&mdash;additional charges for child care, education, health and pharmaceutical benefits. A whole range of measures are being taken by this government to make life much harder for families, not easier. Now those families are being told they have to meet additional
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4494"> expenses as a result of this government's actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: in terms of the provision being made available for additional resources in the education sector&mdash;which this government is increasingly relying upon to meet the social problems that it is creating and making much worse&mdash;what you see is that resources are being taken away, particularly in the TAFE area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry. Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and Mr Beazley presided over the virtual demise of Australia's apprenticeship and traineeship system. That is what happened. Why have we got a low skills base in Australia now? Because over 13 years of Labor, we saw a decline in traineeships and apprenticeships. As we start to see reinvestment in the economy&mdash;because there is some hope at last&mdash;the very thing that employers are saying is, `We have got a low skills base.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We don't have the young people with the skills we need.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Labor cannot get its mind around is that this is a totally integrated program. It is a program to address the problems from a range of approaches. It is a program to actually raise that skill level and also encourage young people to take on traineeships. It is a program to encourage young people&mdash;not to give them a disincentive about going into education and traineeship programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Payne asked a question today, she indicated that she had been talking to some young people who had asked her, `Why do we get paid less to study than someone who is unemployed?' That was a very good question those young people were asking, but those issues were not actually looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that there were disincentives for young people&mdash;especially those on the cusp of trying to decide what they were going to do&mdash;to go into training. What we have done is put together a package which will mean there is an opportunity for young people. This package will benefit young people from rural and regional areas who have to move into the city to study. They will be entitled to rent assistance. Before now, that was difficult for them and for their families who had to make sure their children had somewhere to live when they were living away from home. That will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing has been said about young people who were eligible for some form of Austudy between $1 and $1,000 before, but did not get it. For many young people, that amount of money would be very valuable in&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they had to accumulate $1,000 before they were paid a cent. Now that has been wiped out. So there are all sorts of benefits in this package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we hear Labor getting up and doing; what do we hear the Democrats getting up and doing? We hear negative carping, negative, negative&mdash;never talking about the positives, not talking about the fact that the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4495"> youth allowance is simpler and more flexible. They never talk about the fact that we have got rid of five benefits and replaced them with one. What is that going to do to the workload of people in the social security offices? How is that going to streamline it? How is that going to make sure that people get better advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they go in to seek advice about their benefits, of course it will be easier for officers in the social security offices who are currently burdened with having to deal with a range of benefits, and how they get their minds around that I do not know. What we are doing is simplifying it, so it will be simpler and more flexible. It replaces five benefits with one and reduces 13 different rates of payment to five. That surely has to be better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major benefit of this payment is that it recognises that young people's circumstances change and under the youth allowance it will not be as difficult or as confusing for them. The youth allowance activity test requirements recognise that increasing numbers of young people do not follow the traditional pathway from full&hyphen;time study to full&hyphen;time employment. Therefore, young people whose personal circumstances change slightly will no longer have their payments cancelled or be forced to reclaim another payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on. There are other benefits of this. The education leaver waiting period will no longer apply. There will be no minimum payment, as I said, under the youth allowance. The current Austudy provision that no allowance is paid if the annual entitlement amount is less than $1,000 will be abolished. Benefit after benefit&mdash;but do we see Labor saying anything about that? No. They pick up the negative issues, or the things they think are negative, and go on and on about them, rather than saying, `Here is an improvement for young people.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion to take note of the answers provided by Senator Vanstone, I would like to address three issues, and include the answers given by Senator Newman. The implication and insinuation behind the changes to the youth allowance are that this government thinks young
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people make their decisions regarding their educational opportunities by looking at what they stand to gain financially. This is nothing more than an insult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about incentive&mdash;in Senator Newman's words, to rejig incentives to force young people to stay at school&mdash;they are quite clearly saying that young people seem to look at the dollar bottom line and think, `Oh well, is it worth staying at school for an extra few dollars, because I can get it on the  dole as opposed to Austudy, or is it worth me going to training?' I say to you, Senator Vanstone, that you obviously have not spoken to too many young people recently. In case you had not noticed, their major concern is their prospects of getting a job. To imply that an incentive is required to keep them off unemployment benefit is nothing more than a disgraceful insult and a reflection of your ignorance as to the motivations, concerns, aspirations and, indeed, experiences of Australia's young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I would like to raise is the flawed logic behind this whole policy approach. It is an incomplete equation or sequence. What this government has done is talked about an incentive to get people off unemployment benefits, and that incentive is in fact in the form of a disincentive of cutting benefits, of denying support where it is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step in the sequence or the equation is the ability for them to stay at school, to actually remain in education, to have the opportunity to educate themselves. The problem with that is that this next sequence in the equation has already been undermined by the government, and it has been undermined in the form of cuts to the TAFE system of $72 million. We know that Australia&hyphen;wide 60,000 people who applied to TAFE were denied a place because of the cuts in funding. We know that over $800 million is being cut from higher education funding over the next four years and that that is reducing enrolment levels and applications for enrolment. We know that. We also know that there has been an attack on the public education system generally. So this all starts to paint a pretty
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4496"> drastic picture as to the second step in the sequence behind this government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the third step? It is jobs. Why do you educate yourself? So that you can get a job at the end of it. The problem is that this government is worried about the first step, the disincentives, the cutting of support; they have shafted completely the second step, which is the opportunity to have some form of education in a range of choices; and the third step is jobs. And what have we seen from this government in terms of jobs? The most the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can hold up is the federation fund, the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund and the work for the dole green jobs, something to do with the&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PATTERSON" NAMEID="LI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator LUNDY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The green corps. Thank you, Senator Patterson. My point is that there is no substance in those jobs. Those jobs that they are talking about are not real. At this stage the federation fund has had no funding allocated to it. It is a pipe dream; it is a puff of smoke up there that the Prime Minister will keep blowing around the place for a couple of years yet to gain as much political mileage as possible. There is no substance in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have is a sequence of policy events by this government theoretically providing some solution for young people and some support for young people. But in the first instance they are cutting the support; they have completely wrecked the second point, which is the ability to get access to a decent education; and on the third point, at the end of the time that you spend in an educational institution, the  theory is that there are jobs. If this government spent as much time on a job creation program for young people as they do on coming up with tricky social engineering exercises like the youth allowance, this country would be far better off and taxpayers' money would be far better spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make relates to rhetoric. They talk about choice for young people. To deny young people the opportunity to leave school early and find a job by denying jobs and then to deny them the support that they may need through an unemployment benefit for a short period of time is nothing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than denying choice. It exposes that rhetoric as being totally hypocritical. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

All they want to do is complain. Their system failed; their system failed a whole lot of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me cite a very sad situation in Western Australia. The parents of a young girl who was killed from a heroin overdose said that the $120 a week allowance allowed their daughter to move out of a safe home into a  dangerous environment where she was first introduced to heroin. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4497">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what is a disciplinary matter should not end up with the federal government giving a teenager money to leave home. The allowance should be reserved for cases of genuine abuse.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is what the Labor Party left people as a legacy. What we are trying to do is to get more parents taking more responsibility for their children. If you think that is undesirable, then I challenge you to say why because, quite frankly, Labor was content to relegate young Australians to the scrap heap. They presided over the virtual demise of Australia's apprenticeship and trainee system. In 1995, apprenticeship and traineeship numbers fell to their lowest level, as a percentage of the work force, in three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the Labor Party is happy to come in here and flap their gums loud and long about the way in which they supposedly helped young people. It is interesting to note that even organisations like the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and people like Bishop Michael Challen, have welcomed the news that young people forced to live away from their families will be better supported to stay at school, or in training, under a new youth allowance. Bishop Challen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for years, and finally their need is starting to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are five Labor senators sitting on the other side at the moment and not one of them has listened to the quote from Bishop Challen. The fact of the matter is that they have said that they have been asking for this support for years, and Labor refused it. Bishop Challen also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homeless young people are often forced to drop out of school or training simply because the financial pressures are too great.

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is interesting to note that there is nothing positive, yet again, that the Labor Party can say about a measure that is designed to help young people. It must be noted that our means test is in fact higher than that of the Labor Party. What are they grizzling about? It is more than $41,000 compared with $37,000 for a family with one child at home.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hoped that the government would grasp the opportunity to actually improve benefits. We hoped that it would come up with a benefit that would avoid the poverty line and poverty cycle traps that we have seen occur with Austudy and unemployment benefits.

But, in fact, we can see that that is what they have done.</PARA>

Every caller, regardless of age, sex or background&mdash;particularly those from lower&hyphen; and middle&hyphen;class Australian backgrounds&mdash;have commented on how they are already struggling as families; how they cannot cope with the fact that 25,000 young Australians are going to lose their benefits entirely.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are going to suffer as a result of a means test kicking in at just over $23,000 and funding which cuts out at around $41,000&mdash;or $58,000 if they are living away from home. There will be 50,000 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who will be affected by those provisions. Some of them will completely lose their benefits and others will have their benefits reduced. We are talking about a lot of young people. How dare the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) stand up here today and suggest that going on the dole was an incentive; that unemployment benefits were an incentive for not participating in higher education or education training at any other level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why doesn't this government introduce carrots and not sticks? Why don't they make education and training more accessible, much more equitable and publicly funded instead of having this massive shift from public funding to private funding and to user pays&mdash;the emphasis on individual benefit that we see occurring under this government? Why do they increase fees and charges at every level&mdash;up&hyphen;front full&hyphen;cost fees for higher education at undergraduate places, HECS hikes for undergraduate university education, further deregulation of the post&hyphen;graduate sector and a possible&mdash;I admit Senator Vanstone has said on record that she will rule this out, so I am assuming this will never happen&mdash;HECS scheme for TAFE?</PARA>

There are links between youth unemployment and youth suicide levels as well. I am not suggesting that anyone promotes that or thinks that that is not a bad thing. But we have to look at the interrelated factors, and we have to work out a way whereby young people are not cast into poverty and where their families are not struggling and are expected to support dependent children&mdash;in some cases up until the age of 25.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the research show about people who stay in training? It says that they have three times the chance of getting a job as someone who has not been trained.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 3(1)(b) provides that a Magistrate may require a person who is only to produce documents, other articles or both, in that person's custody, to attend and to produce them. This appears to be a restrictive provision given the distance that people may be required to travel and the rapid forms of communication available today. For instance, is it intended that a Magistrate in Hobart who considers that a person in Darwin has custody of some relevant documents should require that person to bring the documents to Hobart?  Is this the only way that such documents can be produced under the Regulations?  In this context the Explanatory Statement advises that forms for search warrants will be available electronically because this is "inherently more flexible". The Committee considers that these flexible electronic or courier services should be available to members of the public and that the Regulations should provide for this if existing provisions do not do so.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 26 March 1997 concerning the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1997 No. 3), and to the notice given by Senator Calvert in the Senate on 26 March 1997 that you will move, 15 sitting days after that date, that the regulations be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have expressed concerns in relation to two regulations (3(1)(b) and 12.11). For the reasons set out below and in the context of all the relevant legislative provisions, I consider that regulations 3(1)(b) and 12.11 are acceptable. I therefore urge you not to proceed with the motion of disallowance.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4506"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the proposed disallowance motion relates to the whole of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1997 No. 3). If these were to be disallowed, the operation of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (MA Act) would be affected which would impact adversely on case matters. If you do proceed with a motion of disallowance, I strongly urge that you seek to disallow only regulations 3 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 3(1)(b)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 3(1)(b) provides that a Magistrate may issue a summons requiring a person who is only to produce documents, other articles or both, to attend before the Magistrate and produce them. You state that this appears to be a restrictive provision given the distance that people may be required to travel and the rapid forms of communication available today, and you suggest that flexible electronic or courier services should be available to members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation must be read in the context of section 13 of the MA Act. The purpose of section 13 is to enable the taking of evidence and production of documents or other articles in Australia on behalf of a foreign country in relation to a criminal matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, a foreign country would make a request to the Attorney&hyphen;General for documents or other articles in Australia to be produced for the purpose of criminal proceedings in that country (subsection 13(1). Where the Attorney&hyphen;General authorises the production of documents or other articles, paragraph 13(2)(b) provides that a Magistrate may require the documents or other articles to be produced. Regulation 3(1)(b) sets out the procedure by which a Magistrate may do this (namely by issuing a summons). If documents or other articles are produced, the Magistrate is then required to send the documents, or copies of the documents certified by the Magistrate to be true copies, or the other articles, to the Attorney&hyphen;General for forwarding on to the requesting country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made to regulation 3 do not substantively change the previous regulations. The new regulations clearly distinguish between persons who are required to attend and give evidence as witnesses (regulation 3(1)(a)), and persons who are required to attend only to produce documents or articles (regulations 3(1)(b)). An example of a person who would come under regulation 3(1)(b) is a person who is required to produce business records such as bank records, but who is not required to provide evidence and to be cross&hyphen;examined. The intention of the amendment to the regulations is to ensure that the purpose of a summons issued under these provisions is clear on its face. The person to whom the summons is addressed is left in no doubt about the purpose for which he or she is required to attend before a Magistrate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, `production of documents or articles' has a technical legal meaning in this context. In producing the documents or articles, the relevant person will need to provide appropriate information on oath
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (formal evidence) on such things as their position in the company, the status of the items produced and in the case of records on the accuracy of their contents. This formal evidence is necessary to put the documents or articles in admissible form so that they may be adduced in evidence in any proceedings in the requesting country. It is important to bear in mind that the material is to be used in criminal proceedings and therefore will need to comply strictly with admissibility requirements. It is also important to bear in mind that the material is to be used in a foreign country. Providing this formal evidence to a Magistrate in Australia is preferable to requiring the person to attend a court in another country in  order to comply with the necessary formalities relating to the admissibility of documents or articles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the international nature of these requests and the implications for admissibility in court proceedings involving criminal matters in other countries, my view is that it is essential to have a person, who has custody or control of the relevant documents or articles, to appear physically before a Magistrate in order to produce those documents or articles. The person should not, for example, be able to simply mail those items or deliver them to the Magistrate using electronic or courier services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I consider that it is appropriate for regulation 3(1)(b) to require a person to attend before a Magistrate for the purpose of producing documents or other articles. I assure you that, as a matter of administrative practice, the documents or other articles are always sought in a manner involving the least amount of inconvenience to the holder of the documents or other articles. For example, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions proceeds on the basis that a warrant should be issued in jurisdiction in which the relevant person resides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The production of documents or other articles would therefore be sought in the State or Territory in which the person who has custody of those things is located. I would not envisage the situation arising where, for example, a Magistrate in Hobart who considers that a person in Darwin has custody of some relevant documents requires that person to bring the documents to Hobart. The Attorney&hyphen;General's authorisation under subsection 13(1) would instead be given to a Magistrate in Darwin. I wish to draw to your attention that in cases where documents have been located in different jurisdictions, the Attorney&hyphen;General has issued multiple authorisations to Magistrates in different jurisdictions in order to avoid the type of problem you have identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 12.11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 12.11 omits Forms 4, 5 and 6 which comprise an Application for Search Warrant (Person), Application for Search Warrant (Premises) and Search Warrant respectively. You note that the current Form 6 provides the usual protection relating to necessary and reasonable force, and on reasonable grounds, and you seek confir
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4507"> mation that the new electronic forms will include these safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the protections you refer to are the subject of substantive provisions in the MA Act itself. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Act 1996 inserted a new Part VIIA in the Act dealing with search, seizure and powers of arrest. This is an extensive new Part (comprising sections 38A to 38Z) which is consistent with amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 made by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures for applying for, issuing and executing search warrants are all subject to the requirements of the legislation. Section 38B deals with the application for search warrants, and requires a police officer to have "reasonable grounds" in relation to suspecting the location of relevant evidential material. Section 38C required a Magistrate to be satisfied that there are such reasonable grounds before the Magistrate can issue a search warrant. Section 38J, which deals with the execution of search warrants, authorises the obtaining of assistance and use of force as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances. These requirements would all need to be satisfied, regardless of whether they are stated on a statutory or administrative form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previously the MA Act required the relevant forms to be prescribed in the regulations. The reason for no longer prescribing these forms statutorily is that prescribed forms are inherently inflexible, unable to be updated without amending regulations, and can give rise to technical legal arguments about whether the prescribed form has been strictly complied with. For purposes of administrative convenience and efficiency, precedents will still be drafted so that a new form does not need to be re&hyphen;invented every time an application is made. It is intended that these forms will be available electronically to investigators and prosecutors so that they can readily enter their specific information, while retaining the standard provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is not necessary as a matter of substantive law to have the wording you have referred to on the forms, I do see considerable benefit in including words relating to reasonable grounds, and necessary and reasonable force on the face of the form to advise recipients of those limitations and to reinforce the substantive law. I am advised that the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has issued draft administrative forms which include such wording.</PARA>

The Attorney-General's office advised me that certain of those requests possibly breached privacy considerations. I amended the return to order to focus on non-natural persons. The number of non-natural persons are unlikely to exceed 30. It is an issue of legal aid under section 183 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, as do all parties, I hope, fully support the rights of farmers, Aborigines and others to legal aid under the requirements of a normal means test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray is requesting, among other things, the tabling of information which will identify&mdash;and he does not deny this, as I understood his remarks&mdash;directly or indirectly the successful applicants of financial assistance schemes established under section 183 of the Native Title Act and the non-statutory special circumstances scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is prepared to provide statistical information and general material relating to the assessment of applications for financial assistance which does not identify any particular applicant or involve disclosure of their financial or other circumstances. That was outlined in the Attorney-General's letter to Senator Murray of 28 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have for tabling information prepared by the Attorney-General's Department which
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4510"> answers those aspects of Senator Murray's motion which do not require disclosure of identifying material&mdash;that is, paragraphs (d), (i) and (k) of the motion. There are also aspects of paragraphs (h) and (j) for which we will be providing material&mdash;and these matters relate to the number of people assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is able to provide the Senate with the means test which is applied in requests for financial assistance in native title matters. This means test is contained in the relevant guidelines. Those guidelines were approved by the previous Attorney-General and are attached to the information provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The means test is applied to all applicants, irrespective of whether they are indigenous or not. The means test requires consideration of the financial hardship to the applicant and the focus is whether the applicant could meet the costs of the matter without getting into serious financial difficulty. Applicants are required to provide extensive financial information about themselves as well as full details of the case to enable a proper assessment of the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General's Department has prepared tables which set out the number of individuals, groups or corporate bodies&mdash;both indigenous and non-indigenous&mdash;who have been assisted to May 1997 under the native title assistance schemes. The rates at which assistance is provided is also set out in the material prepared by the department. There are two different rates. For standard matters, the rate is 80 per cent of the Federal Court scale, and for cases determined by the department as test cases, the rate is 100 per cent of the Federal Court scale. Standard conditions are contained in the guidelines. Senators should of course note that where a particular applicant is assessed as being able to make some payment towards the cost of the case, a contribution is required as a matter of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government is prepared to provide information which is statistical or general in nature, to the extent that the senator's motion requires tabling in parliament of material which identifies individuals&mdash;whether they are corporate bodies or natural persons&mdash;or would involve disclosure of their financial
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or other circumstances, the government is not prepared to breach applicant confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There exists a longstanding practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence. This practice extends to neither confirming nor denying that particular applications have been received. The practice accords with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 in relation to information provided by natural persons and the general law of breach of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the information in the present circumstance was supplied to the government for the purpose of the administration of section 183 of the Native Title Act. Noting that one of the criteria under section 183 for granting assistance is hardship to the applicant, it is obviously necessary, for the administration of section 183, that applicants disclose full details of their financial circumstances. The balance of the information in this matter was supplied to the government for the purpose of the administration of the non&hyphen;statutory special circumstances scheme&mdash;for provision of financial assistance prior to the inquiry stage of native title proceedings and also to assist persons involved in common law native title claims. Again, one of the criteria for granting assistance under this scheme is hardship to the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To demonstrate hardship, it is required that applicants disclose their financial circumstances. If the confidentiality of such information could not be maintained, there would be a substantial risk that persons having legitimate applications for assistance would be dissuaded from making such applications. This would prejudice the proper operation of the assistance scheme established by section 183 of the act and of the special circumstances scheme. That would be contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title financial assistance schemes are a form of legal aid provided directly by the Commonwealth. The vast majority of legal aid in Australia is provided through state and territory legal aid commissions. Senators should note that in New South Wales, for instance, there is not only a longstanding
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4511"> convention that successive Attorneys&hyphen;General do not release confidential information about individual applicants; there is also a statutory prohibition on disclosure. Similar secrecy requirements are imposed in Senator Murray's home state of Western Australia. He could not obtain from legal aid in Western Australia the kind of information that he is asking the Commonwealth to disclose in relation to applications that are made to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the government resists those aspects of the motion which would identify successful applicants who are non&hyphen;natural persons, on the basis that this would be contrary to the principles of the general law of breach of confidence and contrary to the public interest. Had the senator continued to seek the tabling of material which identifies natural persons, this would have been further resisted, on the basis that it would be contrary to the principles established by the Privacy Act. I am sure the Australian public would expect that information provided in confidence to government would not be released or used for purposes other than those for which it was originally provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only one other point to add, Senator Murray. You indicate that you believe that there are only 30 of these. That may be the case, but the point of the confidentiality of someone's financial circumstances relates to that person. It is their financial circumstances that they are entitled not to have displayed before the world simply because they are an applicant for legal assistance. Whether there is one of them or there are 30 makes little difference; the sin committed is the same. The government is not persuaded by the fact that you seek it for only this or that number. The point is that there is a longstanding practice&mdash;for the purposes I have outlined&mdash;of not revealing the details of individual applicants. The government believes that is an appropriate practice which it intends to maintain.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are guidelines in relation to such things as in confidence and commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence. In many cases, what happens with governments and government departments is that the actual reality of the confidence is hidden in other issues. The
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> names of people who, for instance, apply for legal aid would hardly be secret in the end. Court lists are not secret. It is possible to find  out that a person has been represented by a legal aid lawyer. You might find out that some people may have requested legal aid and got it knocked back. In some cases, that might be thought of as a secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The confidential information about a person's private financial situation can be argued in various ways. If that is what the guidelines say, those elements can be removed from the information that is sought. The fact that various Attorneys&hyphen;General, under freedom of information or requests from the Senate, have very frequently used the issue of confidentiality&mdash;and especially commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence&mdash;does not necessarily mean that it is right. The very recent AAT ruling, which I mentioned in the Senate just the other day&mdash;that ruling was in May&mdash;would indicate that the range of what commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence comprises is actually very narrow, even under AAT rulings. It looks at the books and the specific financial situation of a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be possible that departments can provide information without providing anything that will specifically damage the business of any individual. That is quite possible in a grown&hyphen;up world. It is time for governments of all colours to stop hiding behind a very broad concept of secret&mdash;and commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and confidentiality&mdash;and to start looking at the fact that there are issues which people deserve to know. There are issues where any relatively competent department can provide information without damaging anything of a commercial nature for the people involved&mdash;or their confidences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, you do not have to come into court with a bag over your head. People do know who it is that is standing up in court, unless you are a minor, and it is easy to find out whether a person is represented by a legal aid lawyer. So I do not think the argument holds water. There are guidelines, and it is possible to protect specific information about a person's wherewithal. I do not think what is being asked here is unreasonable.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various provisions of the bill should be seen in the context of the government's on&hyphen;going commitment to quality, diversity, equity and innovative change in the higher education sector. It strengthens the framework, initiated by this government last year, on which the sector can build for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides supplementation for price movements, covering items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, grants to open learning
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> organisations and the total limit for certain grants. The total increase in 1998 will be $9,658,000.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides $26 million over the next four years to fund the rationalisation and restructuring programme, as announced in the budget. This programme complements the existing provision that allows institutions to receive an advance of operating grant to assist with the cashflow implications of restructuring. The programme will assist institutions with restructuring and rationalisation activities that will lead to permanent benefits, and which are beyond the funding capacity of the institution involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funds will be used to support a variety of proposals including: rationalisation of programmes; the joint development of infrastructure, including electronic infrastructure; and the collaborative use of shared activities and resources with other institutions. Assistance provided under the programme is anticipated to be of particular benefit to regional institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through this bill, the government is furthering equitable access to higher education by introducing a 25 per cent discount for partial up&hyphen;front Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) payments of $500 or more. This will benefit students who have been unable to access the previous 25 per cent discount, available only to those students who were able to pay their full hecs contribution up&hyphen;front.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure also redresses the existing inequity between an arts student receiving a 25 per cent discount on an up&hyphen;front payment of their full hecs contribution of $3,300 and a law student who might wish to pay the same amount, but would not be eligible for any discount unless they could pay their full up&hyphen;front HECS charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure provides an incentive for students to partially pay their hecs contribution up&hyphen;front, and will be of real benefit to HECS liable students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements build on and strengthen the essential features of HECS, to continue to ensure that no qualified student is prevented from entering higher education because of an inability to pay at the time of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for streamlining of the application arrangements for remission of student debts incurred under HECS and the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS). This measure will make the remission arrangements simpler and more accessible to students, by replacing the complex two&hyphen;tiered application process with a more generous set 12 month timeframe for all remission applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this measure, most students will actually have longer to seek remission of their debt. Students will no longer have to apply within a set 3 month period, which has been an artificial barrier for students seeking to have their debt remitted. The new arrangements make the application process more transparent and accessible to students, and are less cumbersome to administer.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4514"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, this government has moved quickly to address concerns expressed by the administrative appeals tribunal about the legal limitations of the guidelines that have applied to the remission of debts. The bill will now give legislative force to the administrative guidelines on remission of debts by providing for them to be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 to tighten the arrangements relating to the early release of monies held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve, or SHAR. These amendments are consistent with measures announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget reforming current arrangements for the early release of superannuation benefits to members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget reforms will apply to savings in superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts and will largely be implemented through amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations and the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations. However, to ensure complete coverage of all superannuation savings arrangements, the government has decided to extend the reforms to SHAR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SHAR was established to accept superannuation contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's superannuation fund will not accept a particular contribution because of requirements that fees and charges not exceed the interest earned on such amounts.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the government's retirement incomes policy that superannuation savings should be preserved for retirement, SHAR only permits contributions to be accessed by the individual for whose benefit they are held, in the following circumstances:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Before lunch I was suggesting that we move to clause 68, but I gather the government would rather move to the next set of amendments on the schedule. Those amendments are in our name, but identical amendments are to be moved by the Democrats and the Greens. In a sense, they go to matters that relate to whether the ballot should be a postal ballot. We have already resolved within the opinion of the Senate that the ballot should be compulsory, that it should not be voluntary. This set of amendments goes to about seven or eight different issues which provide for a postal ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the government has made a decision to try the option of a compulsory postal ballot but, if the opposition, Democrat and Green amendments do not get up at this stage, then we will be in a position where the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 will reflect support for a  compulsory postal ballot. That would raise all sorts of problems, some of which the government may have considered but the total implications of which the government may not have considered. The concept of a compulsory postal ballot is one which, it could be agreed overwhelmingly, would be very hard to implement and administer. For that reason, we are moving amendments Nos 5 to 7, 10, 21, 33, 39, 41, 43, 76, 77 and 79 which do,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in fact, reject the concept of a compulsory postal ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said in the earlier debate&mdash;there is probably no need to revisit all those arguments&mdash;the attendance ballot is the most appropriate one to pursue, and we do pursue it, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. In terms of the practical problems with a compulsory postal ballot, one does not have to apply their minds too much and too hard to realise that it is almost an impossibility to provide in law for a situation where people would have to mail back the ballot slip and envelope, or whatever. I think you will find a compulsion in terms of a postal ballot is something which is very hard to apply. We want to move on to consideration of an attendance day ballot and in some senses see these amendments as somewhat consequential to the decision taken by the Senate before lunch.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing these amendments. I note Senator Bolkus's comments. I did not realise there were difficulties with compulsory elections. I thought compulsory elections were good all the time. I note with interest that compulsion and postal do not go together. Perhaps the opposition should have thought of that when they decided to make this bill compulsory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I deal with the reasons why the government does believe it is appropriate in this case for this election to be a postal ballot. There were a whole lot of reasons why we thought it should be postal, but, given our primary decision in relation to it being voluntary, there were and still are good reasons for it to be postal. It is quite clear&mdash;and I do not think the opposition would contend the argument&mdash;that a postal ballot does generally result in a higher turnout than an attendance ballot, when it is voluntary. That has been well proven in many elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what the opposition have said, we are interested in a high turnout for this election. We are just not prepared to force people to do so. We would rather use the carrot than the stick. So there is a linkage, but not a fatal
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4516"> linkage, in the sense that without voluntary voting we would walk away from postal voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An attendance ballot, it must be said, would cost around $50 million compared with the estimate for a postal ballot of $35 or $36 million. So if we are just talking about whether it is postal or attendance, we are talking about a difference of a considerable amount of money. That is a consideration in this case for a government which, as you all know, has had to contend with a significant problem in the government's finances. While we are prepared to commit some $36 million to an election, we think that is an amount that is warranted. But to go to a compulsory attendance ballot, you are talking up to $20 million extra to elect delegates to attend a 10&hyphen;day convention. Of course, the convention will cost some millions to run so we drew a line at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do believe that it is appropriate to have a postal vote. They are now very widely held in the community in a range of organisations&mdash;at local government level, in a number of civil organisations and in the trade union movement&mdash;and it is a growing feature of state and federal elections that people cast their vote by post. We are not, as a government, advocating any greater postal voting in parliamentary elections. But this is not a parliamentary election, as we have to keep reminding the Senate. It is an election for delegates, elected state wide, to a 10&hyphen;day convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe there is either the incentive or the opportunity for any fraudulent activity. There are a number of quite appropriate security measures built into the bill to minimise the extent to which there is any electoral fraud. I find it a bit rich to hear arguments about electoral fraud, given the  opposition's constant statements when in government that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that there is any disenfranchising. The argument about millions of people not having the opportunity to vote is based on a slightly misleading perception about statistics in this area. There are about
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two million voters, I gather, who change their enrolment throughout the course of any one year. So there is a 20 per cent turnover in the roll in any one year. That does not mean that at any one time on any one day there are two million people incorrectly enrolled. If that were the case, I think we would have a very significant problem with our electoral system. That is simply not the case. There are far fewer than that who at any one time are not enrolled correctly. There will, of course, be the normal period between the calling of the election and the closing of the rolls, and that always results in increased activity from electors to correct their enrolments. That same opportunity will apply in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who do not receive ballot papers because they are incorrectly enrolled will be able to obtain them. So that is being allowed for. There is sufficient time, because we are allowing three to four weeks from the dispatch of the postal ballot material to the time they have to be returned. So anyone who genuinely wants to vote but is not properly enrolled&mdash;and, as I said, we do want people to vote&mdash;will have that opportunity to get their ballot paper. There should not be all that many people in that situation. The other argument raised in this area is about Australian citizens from non-English speaking backgrounds. Again, as outlined to the Senate committee that inquired into this bill&mdash;and we should not forget there has been a full Senate inquiry into this bill&mdash;there are adequate measures in the bill to deal with that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that it was not incidental to the government's consideration of this matter that this is a unique election. It will not involve the normal political parties and it will not involve the normal issues. There has not been anything like this for Australians before. There will be different candidates, different parties and different groups all discussing the one issue of whether or not Australia becomes a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think there will be some advantage in voters receiving, some three to four weeks before they finally have to vote, all the relevant voting material indicating who all the candidates are, what their objectives are, what they stand for, how to contact them and a lot
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4517"> of information on how to vote. They will have sufficient time&mdash;as I say, three to four weeks&mdash;to give a lot of thought to how they want to vote through this postal voting process. I think it has those advantages. So we do believe that, on balance, this election ought to be conducted by post.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a couple of points that Senator Minchin made. I say at the outset that this debate will be a lot shorter if we are not going to be in the business of distortion. You know full well, Senator Minchin, that our position has consistently been that we believe in compulsory attendance ballots. That is the cleanest, fairest and most democratic way to go. To argue that I might, in the language you used, have some problems with the compulsory election denies the fact that I have made it very clear that the concept of a compulsory attendance ballot is the right way to go and the most democratic way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To argue that postal ballots are conducted elsewhere and widely held denies the fact that this is the first time that we are talking about a postal ballot of some 11.7 million people. Local council ballots are small in number. Trade union ballots are small in number. We are talking here of a nationwide&mdash;11.7 million people, maybe 12 million people&mdash;postal ballot. We think that in those circumstances there is increased capacity for fraud. We are concerned about fraud in postal ballots. Nothing we have said in the past would go to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the roll and the elections, as they are currently run, we reckon we have one of the fairest and cleanest systems you can find, if not the fairest and the cleanest. Evidence after evidence adduced to parliamentary committees supports that position. But, when you talk about some 12 million voting envelopes going out to the electorate,  with no extra resources to ensure the security of that delivery and very little security in terms of who votes for whom, you have to be concerned about fraud in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may not be a parliamentary election; but this goes to the heart of the Australian constitution. As such, it needs to be treated as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> importantly, if not more importantly, than an election for the parliament every three years. We are talking here of a fundamental step. If you take the government's word seriously in this proposition, then this is an important step towards constitutional reform. If it is an important step towards constitutional reform, then it needs to be treated as seriously as a normal ballot. That is why we say that a postal ballot is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always said that two million people move each year and that some re&hyphen;register. We also said at the same time as that that no information will be provided in the voting envelopes to families of non-English speaking background and there will be no normal assistance for the aged, the frail, those who are not literate and so on. There are hundreds of thousands of those people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect that needs to be responded to is the capacity for people to change their enrolment, to re&hyphen;enrol. Senator Minchin might say, `It's a four&hyphen;week election campaign and people will have a chance to consider their vote.' But you are providing for one week from the close of nominations to the close of the rolls. When you are talking about a desensitised community to this issue, when you are talking about an election that in many ways will come upon them as a surprise, then you should realise that allowing so many people seven days, in the absence of a habitation review for some two years, is nowhere near good enough. How many slices of the democratic salami are you going to indulge in to ensure that people do not participate in this? We think a compulsory attendance vote is the only democratic way to go. This particular fall back position is one that is in many ways the worst of all worlds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, I have just a couple of questions. How much would it cost to run a compulsory postal ballot? How much would it cost to run a postal ballot&mdash;compulsory or voluntary&mdash;if you had to use the next size up in envelopes or use a tax pack for the three major states? Isn't it a fact that your constitutional convention is going to cost $4 million?</PARA></SPEECH>

As I say, we are not expecting a need for the envelope the next size up, but whether we will need it is entirely dependent on the number of people who do nominate. If there were a lot of nominations in the biggest state of New South Wales and we had to use that envelope, as you know from evidence&mdash;I think this was all discussed in the original committee, so I am not sure why we are going over it all again&mdash;it would be 75c per item in New South Wales, so you would add that times the number of voters, which is $1&half; million to $2 million, I guess.

We are budgeting for up to $4 million to conduct that convention. We will be meeting the expenses of all delegates in terms of airfares, accommodation and allowances. We will not be paying any sitting fees or anything like that, but to run this thing and pay for delegates' expenses we have budgeted for up to $4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say also, because I think this gets a bit lost in the ether, that of course any change to our constitution would require under current law, which we have no proposal to change, a compulsory attendance ballot at a referendum.

This is an ancillary stage, a preliminary stage, commensurate with our election policy, which was that we have this national discussion in the forum of a convention to which half the delegates would be elected.

I again ask the parliamentary secretary: isn't it the case that there are many people who are enrolled according to a residential address and the electoral office does not know their postal address? I suggest that, if the electoral office is saying it does know both of those things all the way down the line, it is out of touch with how rapidly people are moving in Australia&mdash;I think Senator Bolkus said some two million people move a year&mdash;and how many people have different residential and postal addresses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong this debate. To be correctly enrolled is a matter of law. You must give an address to the Electoral Commission  in the electorate you care to be enrolled in. You must state a residential address. If you want to have material mailed to you at a different address, you can give a postal address, but you have to show an address or you cannot be correctly enrolled. It is a matter of law. We have a compulsory enrolment system. You have to be enrolled and, if you move, you must by law notify the Electoral Commission of your change of address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already said in response to Senator Bolkus that there are nothing like two million people at any one time who are incorrectly addressed. The Electoral Commission cannot, by definition, give you an answer as to how many people on any one day are not living at the address at which they are enrolled. If they do move, they only have 30 days, I think, as a matter of law to correct the enrolment or they are in breach of the Electoral Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You cannot duck this. The point is that the government is instituting a postal election process for the first time. Our names on the electoral roll have always been based on our residential address. In fact, electoral authorities come around and strike you off the roll if they find you are not at that electoral address. It is not postal addresses; it is residential addresses. That is because we have always had voting at the polling booth. You go along to the polling booth and state your name and address and a line gets put through your name if the two match. But never have people been required by law to give their postal address in anticipation of a postal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that people have not necessarily recorded their postal address with the electoral office. They have not been required to. Suddenly, out of the blue, we are having this proposal for an election based on postal addresses, but there has been no provision in the existing laws when people have enrolled up to now to ensure they give their postal address. Sure, the electoral office sends out postal material, but it is doing so to inform people of an election, without there being a legal requirement on the electoral office that a ballot slip goes to everybody on the role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that many people have a different postal address to their residential address, and you do not have the provision to pick up those people and ensure they get their ballot slips under present laws.

That is it; pure and simple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ought to recognise, Senator Minchin, that many Australians do not receive mail at their residential address. It may be that they move a lot. It may be that they get it at their business. Everybody else knows their postal address, but the electoral office does not know where to mail information to those people because it has not recorded it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two issues which need to be noted by the House of Representatives are to do with the question of compulsion. If you have compulsory postal voting, you have two possibilities. The first is that, on Senator Brown's example, substantial numbers of persons who should have received postal ballots will not. They could therefore claim that they could not be subject to compulsion or, alternatively, that they were deliberately excluded from an election to which they should have been allowed access. I can see you would have the prospects of High Court challenges as to the validity of the outcome of such an election where persons do not receive the postal voting ballots and are excluded one way or the other.</PARA>

Further, if they do not receive any postal ballot material because they come within Senator Brown's case&mdash;that it cannot be delivered&mdash;they can obtain that material from the Electoral Commission.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We are dealing with clause 65 and opposition amendment No. 24, Democrats amendment No. 19 and Greens amendment No. 26. Democrats amendment 19 and Greens amendment 26 are identical. The opposition have kindly indicated to me that they would prefer that I led. This clause relates to the issue of candidate statements. We believe that, given the unique nature of this election, candidate statements should be made available to voters as there may be so many groups and individuals that will run on a republican or monarchist ticket, or individually, without identifying their position in detail. That is a feature of this election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the true statements that Senator Minchin has made is that this is not a typical election. This is an election where bodies which do not normally participate will be participating, and their policies and positions will not be clearly identified. Many voters in a normal election attach an automatic significance to the title `Democrat', `Liberal', `Labor', `National' or `Green'. In this situation, they are likely to need more guidance.  Therefore, voters need to be able to assess the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arguments the candidates are putting forward and judge which accords most closely with their own view. As there is no public funding in this election, we believe the AEC should take responsibility for distribution and printing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment differs with the ALP amendment, which is why they have deferred to us in this instance, in that it adds paragraph (d), re availability in post offices, a place which is more often frequented&mdash;although some of us wish it was not so&mdash;than public libraries or divisional returning offices. We think this improves the position. I commend my amendment to the chamber accordingly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment really is consequential upon the Senate's insistence that we spend up to another $20 million on this election to make it a compulsory attendance ballot. The government had provided in its legislation for candidate statements to be received from candidates and to be printed in a booklet so that, in our system, every single Australian elector would receive in the mail, with their ballot material, statements from all the candidates indicating their positions on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, because the Senate is insisting it be a compulsory attendance ballot, that will not be possible, because they will not be receiving anything in the mail. This is partly the farcical situation in which we now find ourselves. So opposition parties have had to scramble together and put in an amendment to try to overcome that situation, to ensure that there is some access to information. Of course, it will not be as good a mechanism as our system for getting information to candidates, which would have ensured that every single Australian elector received information about candidates&mdash;in an election which is unique and will be different&mdash;and about issues they have not faced before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have a situation where that will not be possible and people are going to have to run off to post offices or libraries or something. Senator Brown complained that what we are proposing puts the onus on the elector. This puts a huge onus on electors to find out
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4524"> something about the candidates they are going to vote for. They have to go to libraries or post offices, or somewhere, to find out who on earth are all these candidates, whom they have never heard of. This is part of the stupidity of what the Senate has now done. The government's attitude is that these amendments are all really connected with amendments designed to make it an attendance ballot, to which we are opposed. Therefore, we oppose these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support these amendments. We do not think this is an act of stupidity. We think this is an act to supplement the normal election process. It is an act that appeals to us because it gives another avenue of information to electors, an avenue which otherwise would not be there in the conduct of an ordinary ballot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are suggestions that we should provide resources, through public funding, to ensure that the information gets out through the organisations that will be running candidates. But we have decided not to support that concept in the context of this legislation. So, in the absence of making the demand on government for public funding for this election, we think that this is, in essence, the least we could do to ensure public dissemination of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very inexpensive approach that has been proposed by the Democrats. It is one that will provide people with another avenue of receiving information over and above avenues available to them through the media and avenues available to them through the propagation of information by candidates and their groups. Particularly in the context of not supporting public funding for this proposal, we think that this is a very cost&hyphen;effective approach and one that should be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the restriction on the number of words to be included in information booklets is too tight. It is very difficult to have a group of candidates sum up in 50 words what their position is on the constitution and the need for change&mdash;and indeed on having an Australian as head of state. We want to increase the number of words available from 50 words for the group and 25 per individual candidate to 150 for the group and 50 per candidate. That is still very restrictive on the ability of candidates to account for themselves in putting themselves forward to the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, we are going to have candidates here putting themselves before the people, with very little opportunity, except in this booklet going out to voters, to be able to say where they stand. We can expect that voters
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are going to read that booklet very carefully and they are going to weigh up on the basis of just 50 words per candidate, even if this amendment succeeds, whether or not they are going to vote for that person. Twenty&hyphen;five words is totally inadequate. Fifty words is inadequate but at least it gives some opportunity for people to say a little about why she or he is standing and what they stand for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also gives the opportunity for people whose first language is not English to understand what the candidates stand for, because there is provision here that, in districts where statistically more than five per cent of the people speak as their first language a language other than English, the candidates' words will be translated into that language for that area. So, if people have as their first language Japanese, Vietnamese, Italian, Spanish, Greek or whatever, they will be able to read, in their own first language, before they go to vote, what the candidates are saying to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important in this multicultural society that we provide for those people, at least in those areas where five per cent of people have a language other than English as their first language, to enable them to understand the case being put by candidates every bit as clearly as for the other 95 per cent of the electorate who have English as their first language. I commend these amendments to the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not inclined to support this. The proposition that has been put forward is to increase the number of words that can be used by individuals and groups. As far as the groups are concerned, this appears to me to give them an extra advantage through additional words. That to me is a very strange thing, given the basis of all of this. Under the proposal by the government, which I am not sure that I like anyhow, the maximum number of words in a group statement is the number of words worked out as follows: 50 words plus 25 times the number of candidates for the group.</PARA></TALK.START>

Frankly, that is giving a greater advantage to the groups over the individual candidates than the government is proposing. I would have thought that was something that we should be rather concerned about. Obviously there will be individuals who will seek to get elected to the Constitutional Convention and those individuals no doubt will have something to say to the electorate, but they should not be swamped out by the groups.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just on behalf of the government, can I indicate that we are opposed to these not just for the sake of it but because we do think they raise significant practical problems. That is why in the context of our voluntary postal ballot we were not prepared to accept these. I am grateful to see a dose of reality evident in the chamber. While I accept the bona fides and good intentions of Senator Brown, I am advised that, particularly in relation to the translations he is proposing, it would be not only potentially quite expensive but logistically extremely difficult to implement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might find there are areas where there might be five or 10 languages that meet the criteria where translations to that extent have to be made, printed, checked and everything else. To do it in the time frame in which this would have to be conducted would probably be logistically and extremely difficult. So we do join the other parties in opposing these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Greens are not going to get support on this amendment from elsewhere in the committee, but I hear some support for this idea being entertained further down the line. We have to think about those people who have the greatest difficulty with elections; otherwise, we inadvertently move towards disenfranchising them. This is a very simple matter to attend to. It is not hard. Gracious, the government has very skilled linguists who would be able to translate 50 words in no time at all in those few areas where it would be required!

<PARA STYLE="Para">It may be appropriate at this point to put the government's position in relation to the Senate style voting system which we have proposed and to which there are a couple of amendments&mdash;government amendment No. 3 is one of them. We understand that the opposition parties want the electoral system to be purely as it is for the Senate. The government approached this question in good faith, believing that would be the case, prima facie. When we decided that it would be a Senate style election, we moved into the area on the basis that we would have an actual Senate system, with a ballot paper and a system exactly the same as the one the Senate operates. It soon became apparent, after a thorough discussion with the Electoral Commission and an examination of what was likely to occur in such a ballot, that that was going to prove to be highly impractical&mdash;and probably impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a half Senate election, which is our norm, where you have six candidates up&mdash;and four or five of them are probably pre&hyphen;ordained&mdash;and there are existing and traditional parties contesting those elections, it is a recognised and familiar format. Even in a double dissolution, you have only 12 in every state. In this situation, our proposition&mdash;and you might want to increase it&mdash;was to have 20 positions available in New South Wales, 16 in Victoria and 13 in Queensland. So all those states would have more delegates' positions available than in a double dissolution Senate election. You also have a situation where you are not asking people to commit six years of their lives to this chamber; you are asking them to set aside 10 days in December&mdash;Senator Faulkner has already indicated to me that he is not all that enthusi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> astic about that, and I am sure there are others in that boat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a completely different situation from a Senate election. There could well be many hundreds of Australians who decide, in the circumstances, that they wish to nominate for election to attend what will be a unique event&mdash;a 10&hyphen;day convention to discuss, along with state, federal and territory parliamentarians, the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had to work as a government on the basis of a worst case scenario. In New South Wales, where we would all agree this issue is discussed and debated more than anywhere else&mdash;there is a lot more interest in this issue in New South Wales and you have 20 positions available&mdash;it is reasonable for us to assert that there could well be 400 or 500 candidates wishing to present themselves for election in a method of election that is meant to be based on the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, the Electoral Commission convinced us&mdash;we came to this on the basis that there would be an election exactly the same as the Senate&mdash;that that would practically be impossible, and it would lead to a ballot paper the size of which we had never seen before as to be almost unworkable and a list of candidates the like of which we had never seen before. You would all recall the sort of ridicule that was heaped upon the ACT when it had its first Hare-Clark election and the size of its ballot paper. I think this could leave that in the shade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also evident that if you followed the Senate system exactly, you could be spending two months or more before you knew who had actually been elected. Our plan was for the Constitutional Convention to be sitting in December. In the time frame that we have available to us, that, again, would be an impossible situation. We would all look silly if, on the first day of the convention, we had not yet had a declaration of who was elected to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the advice of the Electoral Commission, we then said, `How can we make it most like a Senate election but do something slightly different to accommodate those difficulties?' On the advice of the commission, we came up
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4531"> with the system that we have. There was some inclination in our party to say, `Let's just make it one&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;box.' I think it was a Labor initiative to bring in one&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;box voting, and 95 per cent of people do vote one&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;box. It was discussed internally. We said that we could solve this problem by having one&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;box voting, as 95 per cent of people now do for the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A consensus was reached within the government that we ought to give people the opportunity to vote `below the line' and to indicate their own order of preferences. That is why we came up with this system of boxes below the line. If voters did not wish to vote one&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;box above the line, either for the group or candidate of their choice and have their preferences distributed according to the registered how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards of the group or candidate, they could vote below the line by putting their preferences in boxes below the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To enable voters to do that sensibly and in a way that could be counted by the Electoral Commission, we decided that every candidate who nominated would have a discrete number. This is in the context of postal voting, where they would have plenty of time. All the elector has to do is determine the order of candidates they want&mdash;they do not have to vote for all of them; it can be any number of candidates they like, option or preferential, but in New South Wales it is up to 20&mdash;and they could put the 20 candidates of their choice in the order of their choice in the boxes below the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did seem to us to be a reasonable compromise. We endorsed the Senate system as it is for Senate elections. I think we all support that. It was just our view, based on Electoral Commission advice, that that was simply not going to work in this case in the unique situation we have before us. Therefore, we have proposed the system that we put before you. I counsel you to think carefully about it and the practicality of having a normal Senate election in these circumstances based on what I have alluded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government amendment No. 3 takes on board the recommendation of the Senate committee&mdash;I think motivated by a recom
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mendation of Malcolm Mackerras&mdash;that in the smaller states we have a minimum number of boxes. I think it is up to nine boxes, which is the number of boxes in Western Australia, so that South Australia, Tasmania and the territories do have that number of boxes. So if they want to indicate more preferences than the seats available from those states, they can do so. We have no objection to that. Therefore, we have taken on board that Senate committee recommendation in the context of the Senate&hyphen;style voting system we have proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do appreciate that explanation from Senator Minchin. I say to Senator Minchin, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that a small part of it makes some sense. I would see in this particular proposal of the government&mdash;in effect, in those states and territories where fewer than nine delegates are to be elected to the convention&mdash;a capacity for voters to choose candidates of their choice up to a number of nine candidates. I say through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Minchin, that I acknowledge that it is a small improvement on a very poor voting system. I do acknowledge that. It means, effectively, that, in those states and territories where there are fewer than nine delegates to be elected, there is more choice for voters. This is one of the very serious concerns that the opposition has with what the government is proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we effectively have before us now is a debate about a completely new ballot paper in the Australian political system. This will be a ballot paper that Australians simply are not used to. It is described by Senator Minchin as a Senate style ballot paper. Apart from the fact that it has a thick black line on the ballot paper, it bears no resemblance to a Senate ballot paper and it certainly bears little resemblance to a Senate voting system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real concern with this&mdash;I would like those senators who are considering their vote on this particular matter to take what I say in relation to below&hyphen;the&hyphen;line voting into consideration&mdash;is that this is extraordinarily complex. It is going to be very hard work for enrolled voters to make a formal ballot if you
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4532"> decide to take the option that many Australian electors do to vote for a number of candidates of your choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to place the candidate number of your preferred candidate into the first preference box; and you find that number in the guide to the Constitutional Convention election booklet. In this case, one assumes that they will not already have it, but it will be available&mdash;correct me if I am wrong, Senator Minchin&mdash;to electors either in booklet form or poster. You then have to get the number next to your preferred candidate name and insert that number in a box on the ballot paper. Then, if you want to extend your vote, you find the next candidate of your choice, you find the candidate number next to that candidate's name and you put that in the box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It looks less complex, I suppose, on this mock&hyphen;up ballot paper. I appreciate that we have received these from the Australian Electoral Commission. It does not look so complex when you get to the state of Tasmania, but when you start to look at the mock&hyphen;up ballot paper for the state of New South Wales you can see what an extraordinary task this is. In the state of New South Wales you may choose to vote for 20 individual candidates in order of your preference. That means on 20 occasions you have to go to a group voting ticket or to a small booklet, find numbers next to candidates' names and insert those numbers on the ballot paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a voting system that is foreign to all Australians. It is something that Australians have never had to do in a ballot of any form at any time in our history. It is extraordinarily complex and I really do think that one can only come to the conclusion&mdash;I hope it is not an accurate conclusion, but it is very hard to come to any other conclusion&mdash;that the government is trying to make this as difficult as possible for people to cast a formal vote. Of course, in all states and territories, if you wish to vote for candidates of your choice&mdash;below the line&mdash;we have a situation for, again, the first time in our federal electoral history, whether it be at a Commonwealth election, a plebiscite or a federal referendum, of optional preferential voting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a massive change to our voting system and something that will be foreign to everyone, even though I know the Electoral Commissioner said in evidence, `Some Australians will be used to it because it is a bit like filling out a betting slip at the TAB.' Some Australians do not fill out betting slips at the TAB.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not realise you had a phone account, Senator Harradine. Good luck to you. If you have a phone account, you would be better off than voters here because there is no suggestion that we are going to have a hotline funded for electors to be able to receive this sort of information in this ballot. Filling out a ballot paper like this, with a complex, completely untried and completely new voting system, will be harder than backing winners at Randwick, and all Australians will have to fill it out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above the line there is a capacity for group voting in the sense that you can vote for the lodged voting ticket of groups or ungrouped candidates, as Senator Minchin has correctly indicated. But again, it is a very different ballot paper design from the Senate ballot paper which Australians are used to. I really think in this situation what governments and parliaments have a responsibility to do is to try to ensure that our electoral process is as reasonably accessible and simple as possible. There is no advantage to anyone in making this a complex exercise to cast a formal vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the concern I have with Senator Minchin's amendment, but I want to come back to where I started my contribution and say this to Senator Minchin. If, indeed, you are successful in your other amendments, and your preferred voting system and ballot paper design is the will of the Senate and the parliament, then I certainly would accept that the amendment that is before the chair at the moment is a small improvement on the government's proposed ballot paper layout. I hope, Senator Minchin, you take my comments in the spirit in which they are intended. They are a small improvement because it does allow people in those states and territories
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4533"> where there are fewer than nine delegates to have more options in extending their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that but I say very clearly to the Senate that it is only a small improvement on what I believe is a totally inappropriate, totally inadequate, ludicrously complex ballot paper layout and voting system, and it is for those reasons that the opposition will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Minchin on behalf of the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak generally to the amendments before us which relate to the conduct of a Senate style voting system. We are all aware, of course, that our Senate style voting system is an open access one. In other words, the number of candidates who get nominated and accepted by the AEC and pay their nomination fee can, in theory, overwhelm our system, but do not. So some of the bogies that we put up may not be true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments relate to the implementation of provisions for the conduct of a Senate style ballot at the election. We prefer, as we have said before, to keep this election as close as possible to that which Australians are familiar with. I think we should accept and recognise that at every election and between elections the AEC does in fact spend substantial sums of money in trying to educate, inform and develop Australians' understanding of the voting system. In that respect, we should not attempt to change the voting system in a way which would undo the value of all those years and dollars in educating Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This election to decide on the shape of Australia's future and its relationship with the world&mdash;of all elections, in our view&mdash;needs to be consistent with other elections that have been held federally. We agree with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). The ballot paper and the system of voting proposed is very  confusing and we believe that that will result in people being turned off by the complexity. We do not accept the government's argument&mdash;at least in relation to New South Wales, not necessarily in relation to the other states&mdash;that there will be so many candidates the ballot paper will be a metre square.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is essential that all candidates' names appear on the ballot paper so that people have before them the names of those they will be voting for. I indicate to you, Senator Minchin, that, like the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, we do think your amendment No. 3 is an advance on your previous position. However, in the event of the identical amendments of the opposition, Australian Democrats and Greens getting up, amendment No. 3 should fall away. I suggest that we deal with those amendments prior to amendment No. 3, otherwise the debate will be aboutface.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussions with the opposition, Senator Murray, it was agreed that we pass amendment No. 3.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk generally about what we have proposed. I hope you accept our bona fides when we say that it was not out of some desire to experiment with the electoral system that we proposed this. It was a desire to have something that would actually work. We are a practical, pragmatic government. We are not proposing any changes to the electoral system as such or to the way in which the Senate is elected. We have operated on the advice of the Electoral Commission. You will note from their public comments and the evidence before the Senate committee that the only two independent electoral experts to have engaged in this debate&mdash;Malcolm Mackerras and the electoral reform society&mdash;both, in principle, endorsed this approach and commended the government on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think, frankly, that it is a little patronising to say to Australians that they are too stupid to work out the electoral system we have proposed. I am not going to get unduly rhetorical about that, but I do think it is a little demeaning of the Australian people to suggest that they are incapable of filling in 20 squares. Anyone who does not want to do that of course has the option of putting the No. 1
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4534"> in the box above the line. As we know in the Senate, 95 per cent of voters do that. If they do not want to fill in the boxes, they can do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, Senator Minchin may have had a big sheet of paper before us; but, if the same number of candidates appeared for a postal ballot that he is proposing and we had the same proportion of ungrouped candidates, those ungrouped candidates would also have their names individually on the ballot slip. The paper he presents to us with 300 names is barely twice bigger than the paper with 140 names prepared for us by the Electoral Commission. I do not know what point he is trying to make, other than the fact that more and more we come back to the point of wondering why we have embarked upon this

<PARA STYLE="Para">We have had a substantive debate on this issue regarding government amendment No. 3, but I would like to respond to the suggestion that Senator Minchin made in his contribution&mdash;an unfortunate comment, I thought&mdash;when he indicated that I had put the view that I did not have adequate faith in Australian electors to be able to fight their way through what is an extraordinarily complex ballot system. That is an unreasonable comment for Senator Minchin to make, and I think he probably understands that it was not the force of my comments at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I was saying is that this is a voting system of which no Australian has had any experience. I do not think even Senator Minchin could argue against that. It is new.  It is untried. It is complex. It is difficult. That is not in any sense a put&hyphen;down of those Australians who have demonstrated in very many federal elections over very many years a capacity to cast formal ballots, but most governments have approached electoral law in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the spirit that we ought to make voting as easy and as accessible as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now most major political parties have approached the Commonwealth electoral law in that spirit. I am doubtful that that same spirit is afoot in the government in relation to the Constitutional Convention. I do not resile from that. I do not resile from the fact that I believe that this is a politically motivated exercise. Voting is being made as hard as possible. This is a new system that happens to, in the view of some Liberal Party apparatchiks, suit the Liberal Party; that is, a voluntary postal ballot. This is all foreign to Australians, who do have a tradition of taking seriously the exercise of their civic responsibility of voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the point that needs to be made. What Senator Minchin is proposing here is not the Australian way of voting. It is not the Australian way that ballot papers have been designed and developed. It is not what Australians are used to. I am sure that is going to cause a very significant amount of confusion in the electorate, particularly when the government is doing nothing to assist those people who might require information and help with voting. That is the point I am trying to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept any comment that the parliamentary secretary might make suggesting that this is a put-down of Australian electors. It is not a put-down. We in this place have a responsibility to assist Australians to cast a formal ballot, to make this process relevant. One way we do that is by ensuring that we do not have an incredibly cumbersome ballot paper which is part of a voting system that no Australian has any familiarity with. That is, in my view, a very retrograde and irresponsible step. That is the spirit of the comments that I made. Senator Minchin probably knows that, and I think he only tries to make a crass political point opportunistically in this debate, and I will not let it go without remarking on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that what we are about is ensuring that we have a voting system, ballot papers, for this Constitutional Convention that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4537"> Australians have knowledge of and familiarity with and that we have a ballot that is in the tried and true Australian mould. What Senator Minchin is putting up, as I have said before, is not the way we do things in this country. I might be being unfair to Senator Minchin, although I do not think so, when I say he and some other apparatchiks from the Liberal Party machine&mdash;of course, I am one of those who admire people who have come from the machines of political parties, and I accept that they make a very positive contribution to parliament&hyphen; I had better say this because I would be in trouble if I did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin brings great expertise in this area, great expertise to the parliament, and this could benefit the parliament, I am sure, if it were applied in a proper and positive way. It is not. It is being applied from someone who is being partisan and politically opportunistic. Those opposite are not well motivated in this. This is a Liberal Party scam, and it is disappointing to see this convention and its voting procedures being used as the thin end of the wedge for the obsession of some in relation to voluntary voting and changing our electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make it accessible to all Australians. We have always understood the importance of our electoral system. We have always embraced compulsory attendance ballots because it is the Australian way of doing things. We have always considered it a civic obligation, an obligation of Australian citizens, to vote in elections, and it is in that spirit that I made the comments I did. So let the record stand corrected.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have considerable sympathy with the proposition put by Senator Brown. However, we think that the time frame and the processes that we are in have gone too far&mdash;that the process of appointing delegates, advising them and progressing it is too far advanced. Right from the start, our preference was for a fully elected convention. However, that is not to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I must acknowledge some of the sense of the government's argument in making appointments in that they have recognised the reality of election processes to date. It does not mean that those election processes would not change in forthcoming elections. But the fact is that, to date, women have not been properly represented in our parliaments, indigenous people are not properly represented in our parliaments, ethnic people are not properly represented in our parliaments and neither are young people. On the current statistics of the federal parliament, without appointments there would be only 20 per cent or less women, no Aboriginal people and no&hyphen;one between the ages of 18 and 25. I am aware from what the government have said that they intend to redress that situation through the appointments process&mdash;and I welcome that. I think that is a useful advance.</PARA>

We went to the last election with that as our promise as to the constitution of the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a mandate for it and for a very good reason. As Senator Murray has explained, the fact is, regrettably, that Australian elections do not produce outcomes that adequately and properly reflect the composition of the Australian population in relation to women, Aborigines and young people in particular. We believe that there should be a component of delegates appointed to the convention to ensure adequate representation of those groups. We also believe that parliamentarians should be involved. One of the beauties of the model which we have proposed is that we will have elected community delegates, parliamentarians and particular appointed delegates to take account of certain groups which are not adequately represented in the electoral process, so that together we can discuss this very important question of whether or not Australia should become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to eight of the 36 appointed delegates being between 18 and 25 years old&mdash;that is just over 10 per cent of the 76 appointed delegates&mdash;as well as to ad equate representation from Aboriginal and

<PARA STYLE="Para">The driving force for this amendment is not numbers but principle. The principle is based on the convention that has been applied to constitutional reform conventions over the last 20 to 30 years. That convention has been that both sides of parliament, either side of parliament, including minor parties, have fair representation. If we look at conventions in the 1970s and 1980s, we would find, for instance, from state representation, that there would be equal numbers from the government side, the coalition, and opposition side of parliament. If one was to look at the federal parliament's representation at conventions in this period of some 25 to 30 years, the same principle has applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the principle that has applied for a long time that we now wish to apply here. We think it is appropriate to do so. No case has been put forward to come up with a proposal whereby, for instance, the federal government has an overbearing majority or state governments have a two to one majority over other parties represented, particularly the opposition, in those states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the principle should be maintained. With that driving force, we realised that the only way we could do that was to somehow get the numbers right by ensuring, as a starting point, that state representation went from three to four and that territory representation went from one to two. We felt that to accommodate that there should be a decrease in federal parliamentary representation from 20 to 16 and such representation to accommodate minor parties as well as give government and opposition fair balance. We also felt that we should not decrease the number of nominated appointed delegates by the parliament. To get the numbers right we felt it needed to come up to 80. We felt to abide by the government's imperative of having half elected and half appointed, then the numbers for those to be elected should go from 76 to 80.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential changes reflected in opposition amendment No. 3 are based on the government's formula for working out how many delegates are appropriate from each state. They do reflect the fact that we have gone from 76 to 80 to ensure an equal number are appointed as opposed to elected.</PARA>

In the context of constitutional change, it has always been an imperative that there be fair representation of the parliament. Over that almost 25-year period that I have referred to, that has been recognised by parliaments of all persuasions. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, on such a critical issue, the government once again has sought to play politics. It is this sort of playing of politics that we seek to redress by amendment No. 3.</PARA></SPEECH>

I wish to address that assertion in my remarks this evening, but before embarking upon those comments I want to pay tribute to the tremendous amount of work and hours which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission spent in providing a vehicle for those affected by the misguided policies of the past in order to give expression to the hurt that was occasioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from what is otherwise a very illuminating report. At page 266 we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genocide was declared to be a crime against humanity by a United Nations Resolution of 1946, followed by the adoption of a Convention in 1948. The Australian practice of Indigenous child removal involved both systematic racial discrimination and genocide as defined by international law. Yet it continued to be practised as official policy long after being clearly prohibited by treaties to which Australia had voluntarily subscribed.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Most Australians, when confronted with the term `genocide', think of national socialism, the Holocaust or events in Africa of late. They do not think of happenings in their own country. Indeed, many Australians would be quite upset at the allegation that their relatives&mdash;that is, those nurses, police, public servants, welfare officers, missionaries and politicians of the time&mdash;were involved in acts of genocide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Genocide is an internationally recognised crime. Article 2 of the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">these are the important words: `with intent to destroy'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it goes through a number of clauses. For the purposes of this contribution, the relevant clause is, `forcibly transferring children of the group to another group'. We are then told in Article 3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Article 4 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons committing genocide shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If genocide did take place, as asserted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, then the corollary is that those responsible ought be charged with committing the crime of genocide. The convention is prescriptive. It says, `Those involved shall be punished.' Those to be punished include constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals. Would it  therefore not stand to reason that those re
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4552"> sponsible be tried for this crime of genocide? That question was indeed put to Mr Sidoti of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission at estimates. His response, on page 110 of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 10 June, is somewhat illuminating. The comment was made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think some of these people may well have been very well motivated and would be horrified to think&mdash;most of them posthumously now&mdash;that they were somewhat engaged in an activity of genocide. I think the vast majority of them would feel absolutely horrified by that assertion, by that finding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Sidoti said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe it is in that area that the question of intention does become relevant . . . intention will go to the issue of criminal liability . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have left out a few words. The questioner continues to ask about the international treaty on genocide and says that it has its basis in criminality. Mr Sidoti then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is that they would be able to successfully defend such a charge if they pleaded intention and could demonstrate intention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting. Perhaps as a last comment I can assure you that there was no single issue in this process that we argued more and longer about ourselves than this issue before we finally came to that conclusion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, that genocide had been committed. So it is quite clear that that caused some considerable debate within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and so it should have done. Unfortunately, I submit that they came to the wrong conclusion. If what Mr Sidoti says in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  is right, then it is an interesting approach to the crime of genocide. The convention clearly says that you need to have the intention to destroy. So, if Mr Sidoti is prepared to admit that the intention is absent, you do not have the crime of genocide. But the consequence of that is, of course, as I have just said, that if there is no intention to destroy there is no genocide. As a result, the whole assertion of genocide comes crashing down. It is clearly unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is sustained, it then needs a perpetrator. Who was the perpetrator? It appears that the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would have us believe that there is such a thing as a crime without a perpetrator&mdash;a perpetratorless crime. If the crime was committed, the perpetrators ought be identified and charged. If you identify them and then say that they are all not guilty, then of course the crime was not committed. But the logical consequence is this: all our former Prime Ministers, as constitutional rulers, all our former Governors-General who are still alive today and&mdash;if you listen to Mr Mick Dodson, who believes genocide is still occurring in Australia today&mdash;the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the current Governor-General and all the other officials should be publicly identified and charged with this international crime of genocide; indeed, so should all the welfare workers and others involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is short. The fact is that the assertion of genocide has been specifically rejected in the past by Commissioner Elliott Johnston in the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I submit that it is still unsustainable today. The use of hyperbole and overpleading the case, I think, has unfortunately done a great disservice to the Aborigines who, through misguided policies, were taken from their parents. Unfortunately, if you overstate the case by claiming genocide, a lot of otherwise sympathetic people will become alienated.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to raise two matters which this government may have thought had gone away but have not. Firstly, I would like to deal with the removal of funds for the Commonwealth dental health program. Senators might remember that in the budget before the most recent one this government saw fit to stop funding under the Commonwealth dental health program, which substantially reduced the funding available to dental health clinics across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These dental health clinics catered for particular groups which were badly off in our community: pensioners, the elderly and also those with health cards who are not in the financial position to be able to provide for their own dental care. These clinics provided that care at absolutely no cost to the recipients. I think they provided a very good service and a service very much appreciated by those who enjoyed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1994, when Labor was in government, a decision was made to provide this additional funding because the clinics as they then operated had insufficient funding and patients were waiting for long periods to have their dental needs dealt with. Certainly it was very successful and it reduced the waiting time to a reasonable period. By the time the scheme was operating at its maximum, people were having to wait for only a few days for emergency treatment and about only eight weeks for regular checkups, which most of us who are better off enjoy having when we choose, which was pretty good.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elderly people are now not getting access to dental care. The funds are limited, and they can get dental care only in an emergency. If they have an ulcer or are in major pain, they can get in within about seven days&mdash;if you are in severe pain, seven days is a very long time&mdash;for some emergency treatment. But, with the limited funds, emergency treatment does not mean what it used to mean. Now it means in many cases just pulling out the tooth concerned. Without those Commonwealth funds, that is all that is allowed for in relation to time and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that in this day and age even those people who are not very well off in our community are entitled to a decent level of dental care, and to me that means a bit more than just yanking out a tooth so that they are not in pain. The elderly and those people on social security with health cards are being treated in that way because of what this government has done to this funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, regular checkups, which I think should be a normal part of people's health care, are not being provided because, once those emergency cases have been dealt with, no time or resources are left to deal with that type of preventative care, which I think is a fundamental part of health care. Postcards like the ones I have here have been distributed from my office and sent directly back to the minister. I do not know the total number which have been sent back, but 192 people have provided them to me first&mdash;I have already tabled one lot; this is the second lot&mdash;and they are then sent on to the minister. I suggest to the Senate that that is just a small token of the number of people who are upset by this decision&mdash;and they come from only the area that I reside in, which is the central coast. I want to express very strongly to this government that a lot of pain and suffering is still being caused by that decision and a lot of people are extraordinarily angry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I want to raise this evening is the importation of cooked chicken meat. This issue has been boiling over since before the election but, in terms of this government's treatment of it, it has been boiling over since the election last year. There has been no adequate response to the whole issue. In May
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4554"> last year there was some disarray when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said that no decision had been made about the importation of cooked chicken meat while at the same time Senator Parer had said in this chamber that the decision had been made and AQIS was finalising the basis upon which cooked chicken meat could be imported from Denmark, the USA and Thailand, but that was finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks goodness the government saw fit to pull back from that decision, but I am fearful, as many people in the chicken industry are, that that was not really a change of position. It was merely a tactical delay in order to disguise the true effect of the government's decision, and I want to remind people of the true impact that the importation of cooked chicken meat could have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of jobs would be affected. About 900 families and 17,000 jobs Australia wide would be affected by the importation of cooked chicken meat. But, more importantly in my view, we will endanger both the purity of our food and our environment if we give up protecting Australia in these two areas by importing cooked chicken meat and we will never return to our original position. We are one of the few countries in the world that are not infested with newcastle disease. That may not seem like much to some people, but newcastle disease is an epidemic in many other countries and, once it gets into chicken stocks, it is almost impossible to remove. Secondly, not only does it affect domestic fowls but it can also infect bird life, particularly our native bird life, which has been protected for many years by our geographical isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel very strongly that the importation of cooked chicken meat into this area does not provide us with an opportunity which is valuable enough to give up one of our disease free livestock for, particularly poultry. Nor does it provide us with a valuable enough opportunity to give up our protected and disease free native birds. I would like to remind the Senate of that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the final decision on the Nairn report, the Senate Rural and Regional
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on cooked chicken meat and the report of the National Task Force on Imported Fish and Fish Products is to come down sometime in the next few weeks, although the government has not been exactly clear when. I would hope that, when that occurs, the firm decision of this government will be that they will not allow the importation of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a meeting just last month on the Central Coast, an area where probably 1,000 people are employed in the chicken industry. Five hundred people attended that rally. I have to say there was a lot of anger and a lot of upset people involved there. They wanted me very strongly to bring back the message to this Senate, the parliament and the government that they will not stand for the importation of chicken meat and that they will all be ensuring that the marginal seat of Robertson, which is now held by Jim Lloyd, will be held by the Labor Party after the next election if the government's decision on this issue is not changed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4554"><TITLE>Dental Health Program</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about one of the important issues that Senator Neal just touched on&mdash;a matter of grave concern to many thousands of low income families and indeed, in many instances, to employers of people who are not able now to access dental health programs. The axing of the Commonwealth dental health program, which was set up in 1994, is already having a very significant and very serious effect in all states where we have been able to get statistics and look at the lengthening of the queues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program was set up in 1994 with the aim of reducing the geographic and financial barriers that prevented low income earners from receiving dental care, in some cases totally. The program injected additional funds into publicly funded dental services that were provided by the states and territories, and there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that it was a highly successful program. It was  well targeted and it was very, very cost-effective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4555">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's evaluation report on the Commonwealth dental health program by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's Dental Statistics and Research Unit makes it very clear just how important and how valuable that program was. They found that, in the two years after the introduction of the Commonwealth dental health program, low income earners who received publicly funded dental care benefited in the following ways: firstly, they had a decreased need for extractions and fillings; secondly, they reported less frequent experiences of toothache; thirdly, they visited more often to actually get dental care; fourthly, they waited shorter times for their check&hyphen;ups; and, fifthly, they were more satisfied with the dental treatment they received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIHW also identified some important flow on benefits, including the development of an oral health and dental policy focus at the Commonwealth level; an improvement in the monitoring and evaluation of adult access to dental care; and the support of a number of much needed ancillary projects, such as the remote and Aboriginal dental care demonstration projects and rural dental projects under the National Oral Health Advisory Committee. The AIHW concluded that, despite the Commonwealth dental health program resulting in improved dental care for card holders and low income earners, they still remained disadvantaged in terms of their oral health and their access to dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the abolition of the Commonwealth program has served to further increase that disadvantage. Indeed, I would argue it has been at a considerable long&hyphen;term cost to the entire Australian community. It was a short-sighted and ill&hyphen;considered move, and I note that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) himself said that he did not enjoy doing it. I suspect that the decision made by Dr Wooldridge was an uncomfortable one for him because he knew how successful that program was. He knew that he was party to actually scrapping one of the most successful health programs. It was a program delivering real and practical health benefits to a group of Australians who now
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> face the loss of teeth as a direct consequence of their inability to pay for dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just take a quick look at who these people are. These are taken from some case studies that have been passed onto us by various public dental health services around the country. A woman in her 40s whose husband died several years ago and who is bringing up four children under 15 had been in pain for weeks before a neighbour told her about the free dental health service at her local community health centre. She needed several fillings. She needed two extractions. There was no way she could afford any of that in the private system. If she had not seen the community health centre's dentists at that time, she would have most certainly lost more teeth and, indeed, had serious problems as a consequence of gum disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A pensioner in his late 60s had a serious gum infection which had gone untreated for several weeks because he could not afford private dental care. When the public service treated him, they also noticed that his existing denture did not fit properly and were able to put him on the priority list for new dentures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 16-year-old homeless boy needed four teeth extracted because he had not been looking after his teeth. He had a drug problem and had not been to see a dentist in a long time. An unemployed sole parent had a 14-year-old daughter who had severe dental pain caused by a broken tooth which had remained untreated for days. The girl's mother was extremely distressed because she had no money to pay for dental treatment and had not known about the public dental service until referred by her general practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I have just one more example. A young man in his 20s with mental illness had been beaten up on the street and left with three broken teeth. He had actually asked a private dental clinic for help but, when they did the assessment and told him how much it was going to cost, he simply could not afford to pay. He was eventually treated as an emergency patient at a local community health centre after being directed there by the casualty department of a large hospital.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4556">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just a few case studies. Indeed, there are many case studies. There are people who have come into this country after surviving horrific dental torture. There are street kids, pensioners, unemployed people, veterans and people with disabilities. There are now people in remote and rural areas who have no access to dental care whatsoever. Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of Australians on low income who now do not have access to proper dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who have suffered from the Commonwealth government's decision to abandon the Commonwealth dental health program. These are the people who now are waiting for years to receive dental treatment. The waiting lists in most states have at least doubled, if not expanded further, and I think one of the hardest hit has been Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at this government's lack of interest and lack of any support in this budget, I would suggest that we are going to see the waiting lists increase. It is going to be this government that is responsible for considerable pain and suffering and, I would suspect, additional treatments in the public hospital system, which in the end is far more expensive for government, as a result of this very poor decision.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4556"><TITLE>Judicial Independence</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment tonight on the almost unprecedented attention given lately to the role of the judiciary, to what are the proper limits to judicial law making and to what are the proper restraints to be observed by judges in making public comments about non&hyphen;judicial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question has arisen against the background of what has been widely regarded as judicial trespass on the role of the legislature and parliament in decisions such as the Mabo judgment in 1992, the recent Wik case on pastoral leases and native title and the free speech cases&mdash;all of which have, to a significant degree, shifted political responsibility from the parliament to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Widespread criticism of this sort of judicial activism led to the unprecedented move by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the judges to declare their judicial independence this year and to set up their own advocate, the Judicial Conference of Australia, a national watchdog to safeguard judicial independence. I might add that the government has provided $60,000 funding to establish the secretariat and $40,000 to enable research to be carried out on judicial independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The doctrine of separation of powers is, of course, an issue of fundamental importance to the proper functioning of our democratic institutions. It is timely that we consider the sorts of issues aired recently in a speech by High Court Justice Michael Kirby, recognising the need to redefine the judicial function to prevent what he has described as `the uncontrolled idiosyncratic opinions of unelected judges'. His Honour's statement calls for a consideration of the proper boundaries between a reformist approach to the law, where legislation is ambiguous or where authority is simply outmoded or an inappropriate expression of contemporary standards on the one hand, and usurping the role of a democratically elected parliament to develop policy and pass laws on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While recognising that there is a role for judges in reforming the law, the difficulty is that in the current adversarial system not only are judges not infallible, they do not and cannot adequately inform themselves of community values or the social and economic impact of decisions beyond the narrow confines of the particular case and the evidence the parties choose to put before the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, we have not developed in our judicial  system a mechanism such as the Brandeis brief, named after the famous Justice Brandeis of the US Supreme Court, who introduced the concept of the broad ranging impact statement able to be filed by third parties to a dispute. We can only wonder what might have been the effect on the court of an economic and social impact statement as to the likely consequences of finding that native title may coexist with pastoral leases or, for example, on the impact on legal aid resources of the High Court decision in Dietrich, where in practice prosecutions, especially for lengthy retrials, can be put  seriously at risk by the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4557"> requirement to provide legal representation at taxpayers' expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This said, there is a crucial role for judges of the High Court to question the appropriateness of rules that were apt for earlier generations and to interpret and develop the law within proper judicial constraints free from political interference. It is an entirely different matter when a judge ventures into the political arena in areas unconnected with the discharge of judicial responsibilities and comments publicly as a judge on controversial political issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been, of course, much quoted recent examples, including that of Mr Justice Nicholson, Chief Judge of the Family Court of Australia, commenting in an overseas forum on the stolen children report. The judge is reported as having claimed to have made his comments as chair of a convention on the rights of children and young people and not in his judicial role. He is reported as having said in an interview that he believed an apology on behalf of the Australian government would be an appropriate response and that there should be no legal reason why such an apology should not be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And herein lies the problem. Whatever personal views one might hold on the matter, it must be said that there are different points of view across the political spectrum about what might be an appropriate response to the stolen children report, and we have yet to see what the government's considered response will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is whether by engaging publicly in matters of political controversy a judge thereby undermines confidence in the administration of justice&mdash;that it will be impartial, fair and untainted by political controversy or bias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the community to make of a judge who has made his or her views publicly known on controversial political matters under active policy consideration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judiciary in Australia has, I hasten to say, a proud record of impartiality. Not for one moment am I suggesting that any actual bias would follow from judges holding private views on contentious matters. But it is also
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the appearance of impartiality that underpins confidence in the administration of justice. Can the community be confident that a judge who has entered the political fray will act impartially if confronted with ideas or propositions he or she does not like?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put it another way. The High Court has consistently refused to entertain applications for advisory judgments, no doubt because such a procedure is not within Commonwealth power. But if it were possible, the court would be constrained to act judicially to hear and consider arguments and to test propositions before coming to a considered view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, for instance, the court were asked to give an advisory opinion in respect of legal problems, if any, with respect to the 10&hyphen;point Wik plan, it would be done as an exercise of judicial power and not as a quasi&hyphen;political statement. There is a stark distinction, I suggest, between a judge weighing up evidence and commenting upon policy considerations as may impact on a case before him or her in the exercise of judicial function on the one hand and, on the other hand, making non&hyphen;judicial public statements about controversial political matters when clothed with judicial office. A judge still speaks with the authority and status conferred by judicial office whether chairing a convention or presiding in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be difficult for some to see the distinction and no doubt difficult for some judges to contain their non&hyphen;judicial utterances. These restraints on free speech might be regarded as but another personal cost of accepting a judicial appointment and making the splendid public contribution that judges usually make. Such restraints are, however, an essential safeguard in avoiding potential abuses of power and in maintaining public confidence in the courts and the independence of the judiciary.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4557"><TITLE>High Court of Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly, given the time remaining, on another issue that is affecting the Australian Capital Territory. I refer to the closure of the High Court on weekends and public holidays as a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4558"> result of budgetary decisions, and would like to put my views on the record with respect to this particular course of events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become quite clear since the budget that the process for the decision making regarding the closure of the High Court is one that is quite complex and rests perhaps not with the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) but with the processes within the High Court to close it. Nonetheless, this government must still bear the responsibility of the consequence of its budget cuts that have led to the closure of the High Court to the public on weekends and public holidays. It is on this basis that I wrote to the minister for territories as opposed to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to ask him to intervene on behalf of the ACT to make representations to ensure that this facility&mdash;this national institution&mdash;does indeed remain open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find myself doing this not from a party political point of view&mdash;a partisan point of view&mdash;but collectively with my colleagues who are representatives from all sides of the political spectrum. I do not think that comes about by any accident. It comes about because we all recognise the injustice of this closure and we all recognise that the implications of this decision could flow on to other national institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is it important? The ACT at the moment is suffering a bit of a beating. I have spoken about that many times in this place. One of the planks in our economic platform here is, of course, tourism. And one of Canberra's great strengths as an economy is our role as the nation's capital. Within that role we are very proud to house the parliamentary triangle and the national treasures that are contained within the parliamentary triangle. The High Court is one such institution that falls within that definition. To close one national institution in that parliamentary triangle will detrimentally affect the ability of the ACT, the nation's capital, to sell itself and promote these national attractions as part of both our status as a national capital and our tourism potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a number of arguments with various people with respect to this: will it
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make a difference whether or not the High Court is open? I believe it will, because of the symbolism of the message that it sends. Already I have had feedback from members of the Tourism Council who were visiting the region recently and who had heard on the national media that the High Court was, indeed, going to be closed to the public on weekends and public holidays. Their response was, `Well, Canberra's really shutting down, isn't it? This is just another nail in the coffin for you guys.' Already, at a national level, it is being perceived as yet another negative impact, another indictment on this government and its regard for the nation's capital. This can seriously damage our role and our ability to promote ourselves as a destination for both Australian and international travellers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the record tonight a bipartisan plea, if you like, for this government to take whatever action is necessary to reverse this decision. I do not really care whether it is the minister for territories or the Attorney&hyphen;General who takes the decision&mdash;or how the process is reached&mdash;but someone needs to take all action possible to reverse this decision to ensure that Australians not only have access to this national institution, but have access to a crucial institution which symbolises Australians' access to justice.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.59 p.m." PAGE="4558"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.59 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The amount of money available for farm forestry activities is still the subject of discussion between myself and Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The National Partnership Arrangements 1997-98 outline the purposes for which funds under the Farm Forestry Program will be made available. In relation to tree planting, funds will be provided for establishing and managing strategic regional plantation and farm forestry

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Forestry Program aims to foster a regionally integrated approach to farm forestry by working in partnership with the States, local government, regional development organisations, industry, landholders and Landcare and community groups.
