<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President this bill implements the government's election commitment to provide rollover relief for the disposal of active assets used by small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rollover relief has been eagerly awaited by thousands of small business operators that potentially faced a capital gains tax bill when they sold an asset and sought to invest the capital in a new one. The CGT acted as an impediment to small business growth and jobs in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill demonstrates this government's strong commitment to small business. This measure provides small business with a boost of $200 million per year. The removal of the "like kind" business test and the extension of time for the acquisition of replacement assets further demonstrates our commitment to listening to the concerns of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayer's eligible for the rollover relief are individuals, partners, companies and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures will apply to disposals of assets on or after 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the bill also implements the government's election commitment to inject $15 million per year to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes in recognition of the role of employee share schemes in strengthening employee participation in Australian business. The bill will double the income tax exemption from $500 to $1000 per employee per year, with a matching increase in the deduction available to employers. This bonus to employees will be available for shares or rights acquired on or after 1 July 1996. The bill also eases the employee participation condition for employee share schemes to qualify for concessional tax treatment from 75 per cent to two thirds of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the employee share scheme provisions announced in the budget are also being made together with a number of technical amendments raised in submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also implements the election commitment to bring an end to the concessional 20 per cent prime cost depreciation rate for trading ships. Transitional arrangements will enable ships that already qualify for the concession to remain eligible, as will as ships in respect of which a purchase or construction contract was signed before 1 May 1996 provided the ship is delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1528">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to section 160ZZS of the Income Tax Assessment Act announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget are also contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend section 160ZZS to require public entities&mdash;that is, public companies, publicly traded unit trusts and mutual insurance organisations&mdash;to test for changes in the majority underlying interests in the assets of the public entity every 5 years from 20 January 1997 or where there is abnormal trading. To assist public entities to undertake these tests, streamlined rules for determining majority underlying interests will be able to be used by public entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers other than public entities will not be affected by the amendment of section 160ZZS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn provisions, and certain rebate and exemption provisions of the income tax law will be amended to replace the current references to Commonwealth education or training programs with a generic term, Commonwealth education or training payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the general expression in the tax law to describe the Commonwealth education or training scheme payments administered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and some other Commonwealth agencies will ensure the taxation result intended to apply to such payments is consistently achieved even when changes are made to those schemes or schemes are deleted or added.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1995 to allow companies the option to defer conversion to the class C franking account after they are paid a class C franked dividend or a trust or partnership amount with class C franking credits attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend that act to eliminate an unintended dual liability to class A franking deficit tax or franking additional tax which may arise in certain situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical amendments will also be made to the foreign source income regime, commercial debt forgiveness provisions, tax file number provisions and provisions relating to equity investments in small and medium enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends three Bounty Acts to achieve savings announced by the government in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. The savings are to be achieved by the termination of the Computers Bounty and the Books Bounty with effect from 30 June 1997 and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Machine Tools and Robots Bounty with effect from 20 August 1996. The bill also extends the ships Bounty to 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is abolishing the Computers, Books and Machine Tools and Robots bounty schemes as they have run their course and are no longer considered to be an appropriate or cost effective means of industry assistance. Recent Industry Commission reports have recommended that each of the bounty schemes be allowed to lapse on their scheduled statutory termination dates. The government has decided to terminate the schemes ahead of their scheduled dates (9 months early for the Machine Tools and Robots Bounty, 6 months for the Books Bounty and 3 and a half years for the Computers Bounty) to assist in eliminating the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Bounties are being paid at declining rates of support, in line with the reduction of general tariff levels, their impact on industry development objectives is declining in importance. The declining rates of assistance also mean that an ever increasing percentage of the total cost to the Commonwealth of each of these bounties is represented by administration and compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to considerations in respect of each of the affected Bounties which the government took into account in making the decision to bring them to an early end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to abolish the Computers Bounty was made because, in the government's view, there are more important factors than the bounty in determining the continuing profitability of Australia's information technology and telecommunications industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These factors include the fundamentals of Australia's broad economic environment, the sophistication of the Australian market place and the enormous opportunities for trade in information technology and telecommunications products and services within our region. Therefore, considering the government's need to address the budget deficit problem, it is not possible to maintain the Computers Bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, I should note that following the budget announcement concerning the cessation of the Computers Bounty, the government has honoured its commitment to convene an Information Industries Taskforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taskforce, the membership of which has largely been drawn from industry, has been asked to provide advice on any alternative measures that might be pursued to ensure that the information industries are able to take advantage of emerging opportunities. In particular, in the light of the termination of the Computers Bounty from 30 June 1997, the Taskforce has been asked to consider whether, and in what form, the information technol 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1529"> ogy and telecommunications industries might require industry assistance from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bounty assistance for the production of books has been in place since 1969 with the current scheme operating since 1987. The Bounty was introduced to offset duties on manufacturing inputs and to enable printing companies to remain internationally competitive. The rate of bounty has declined from 20% in 1987 to its current level of 4.5%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission has recently reviewed assistance for book production. In its draft report, released prior to the budget, the Commission recommended abolition of the Books Bounty when the current scheme expires on 31 December 1997. It noted that industry has improved efficiency despite reducing levels of assistance and this would be expected to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to terminate the Books Bounty from 30 June 1997, rather than budget night as originally announced, has provided industry with 6 months notice of the government's intention to terminate the bounty. The decision speeds up the process recommended by the Industry Commission and yields a small contribution to the process of fiscal consolidation in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Machine Tools and Robots Bounty scheme, which has been in place since 1 July 1985, was also the subject of a recent Industry Commission inquiry. The Commission found that the scheme could not be considered a success as it had not effectively promoted production of metal working machines nor the development of machinery for working advanced materials. It also found that the scheme had not been a significant stimulus to the export of machine tools and robotics, nor had it been effective in encouraging Australian industry to invest in advanced technology machinery. The Commission recommended that the scheme be allowed to lapse on 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to terminate the Machine Tools and Robots Bounties from 20 August 1996 merely speeds up the process recommended by the Industry Commission and yields additional savings to help balance the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To minimise disruption to industry, the bill includes transitional arrangements for the Machine Tools and Robots bounty. The amendments will allow bounty to be paid on equipment already in production on budget night, or the subject of certain contracts entered into before budget night, provided that production is completed by 20 February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian shipbuilding industry has established itself as a world leader in the construction of small to medium lightweight vessels. The innovative use of technology and advanced materials by the Australian shipbuilders has meant a growing market for fast ferries, which are in operation in many countries providing new services as well as replac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing the more traditional ferries. The economies of travel time savings have provided the stimulus for ferry operators to buy Australian built fast ferries. The Australian industry's share of the world fast ferry market has ranged from 25 per cent to 30 per cent in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the shipbuilding industry was reported on by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) in its March 1995 report reviewing the Ships Bounty. One of the recommendations of that report was that it was now time to consider the termination of direct bounty assistance to the industry. In the context of competition from subsidised foreign shipbuilders, the government has therefore decided as an interim measure, to extend the operation of the Ships bounty to 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will review the need for any further extension of the bounty (beyond 31 December 1997) in the second half of 1997. The progress towards implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement (which provides for the cessation of official subsidies by major shipbuilders) is being closely monitored.</PARA>

I think it is more important to get the bill right. We will persist with the position which I outlined in the second reading speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the comments that you have made in relation to the tax law improvement project and the work of Mr Nolan. Some of that flavour may not have come through your remarks last time this bill was debated. I am sure that the officers in the advisory box listen carefully to your remarks and welcome them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to your amendment headed `Rewritten Act not to disadvantage taxpayer', the first point I make is that twice the JCPA has considered this matter. I stress that this bill has been subject to very long exposure, very long debate and analysis by the JCPA. This issue has been considered on two separate occasions. My advice is that, on both those occasions, they have rejected the approach which you were outlining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your idea, as I understand it, is to allow taxpayers to fall back on the 1936 act if they have been disadvantaged by the rewriting of the law. This departs from the normal approach in rewrites of Commonwealth law, which is that the meaning of the rewritten law is not changed merely because different words are used. This is detailed in section 15AC of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and is repeated as clause 1-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that what you have proposed would lead to unnecessary confusion for taxpayers preparing their own tax returns and will have a particularly heavy impact on small 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1532"> businesses and tax agents who have to prepare and weigh up two potential returns. I think that is what you are saying; that they have to have two potential returns before sending one in. I think tax law is complicated enough with one Income Tax Assessment Act. Having two acts to contend with would be even worse and would probably ultimately delay the transition to the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I stress that what you have proposed has been considered by the JCPA. This is part of what has been a very long public exposure of this bill. This issue has been well canvassed before. The government will not be accepting the amendment which you will move.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concur with Senator Kemp in the reasons that he has given for not supporting the amendments that Senator Harradine has indicated he will move. As Senator Kemp has highlighted&mdash;and as Senator Cook highlighted last week in the debate on this legislation&mdash;this is a rewrite and simplification in respect to income tax legislation. It commenced under the previous Labor government I think in 1994. It is a very solid and substantial attempt, which was begun by the Labor government and we are pleased to see concluded by this government, of a simplification and rewrite of the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I certainly would be tempted to support your provision if it were drawn to our attention any particular example of disadvantage. We have not had that drawn to our attention. I certainly will be tempted to support something like this next week when we debate the superannuation surcharge. That is another issue. I do not think Senator Kemp's advisers will be looking forward to that particular debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular no disadvantage clause reminds me of our industrial days, with a blanket no disadvantage provision. I think it is a sound principle.

Then, taken in conjunction with amendment 1, it will push the date out for a year, and it has already been deferred once.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that what your amendment is seeking to do will  effectively, I believe, leave two acts to contend with. I have made the point that the tax law is complicated enough without having two acts to contend with. Frankly, as I have said before, this would only delay the transition to the new law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Senator, I am not the only one saying this and it is not only the government saying this. The JCPA considered this very issue, and in report 345 the committee concluded that `tax law is complex enough' with one set of operative provisions and that having two sets of operative provisions to contend with `would be even worse'. And then they go on to repeat the words that I have just said. The reality is, Senator, that this is the problem that you have presented with your proposed amendment, which we are not disposed to support, and I think you really have very little support around the chamber for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You referred to clause 1&hyphen;3 of the bill quite appropriately, which tells you that if the same idea is being re&hyphen;enacted in different words you should not presume that a different meaning was intended. This clause is deliberately expressed in quite broad terms because it is a very general note of guidance on how the courts and others involved in interpreting the law should proceed. It tells them that they should put aside a presumption that there is a difference in meaning because an idea is expressed in simpler terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You raised the issue of why the word `just' is used with `because' in the clause. There will be times, Senator, when deliberate changes are also made. In fact, this bill does do some of that, but the intended changes are clear and expressed in the explanatory memorandum. So we believe that clause 1&hyphen;3 is sufficient. In the end, if people wish to take court action, they will decide to take court action and there is nothing that we can do in this chamber which will stop some determined people who rightly or wrongly may feel that they have been unjustly treated. We believe that clause 1&hyphen;3 is sufficient, and the reason for putting in the word `just', as I have set out, relates to the fact that there will be times when the deliberate changes are also made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are simplifications and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simplifications. I can think back a couple of years to the precursor of the simplification bills, when I spoke at length. What we saw at that stage was the previous government putting in simple terms more onerous requirements which in fact, at that stage, meant that fewer people would be eligible for legitimate tax deductions, because the amount of documentation was considerably increased as a result of this so-called simplification. We do have a situation where the devil is in the detail. There are two things here; there is the ability to look carefully at the implications of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that there must be a lot of tax lawyers rubbing their hands with glee. Why would they be doing that? They would be doing that because they would realise that we know that there will be a whole new set of test cases run on the new wording. We all know that. A number of case precedents have been set up to this point of time. My understanding is that Senator Harradine's proposed amendment, at this point of time, relates to the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996. Any changes that occur after that obviously amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1996. Therefore it does not mean that the tax law is set in concrete forever. It means that it is agreed that the history of case law to the point at which we are does not have to be totally redone. We do not have to go into this situation of totally rerunning test cases, which will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time if, for instance, the Australian Taxation Office were to see the ability to remove tax treatments and tax concessions and to reinterpret them at some stage someone would challenge that. People do not tend to go down with no comment if such reinterpretation takes place. Therefore, if you were going to get a complaint about complexity, you would probably get it from the tax professionals association, in terms of their job. But from what I hear it seems that they believe that it is going to be simpler for them to operate with the surety that that whole raft of case law does not have to be redone, does not have to be relooked at, does not have to be renegotiated, with the risk involved in rerunning test cases. In that way a lot of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1537"> cost involved with interpretation of tax law may well be kept down by the type of amendment that Senator Harradine is proposing to move.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the matters raised by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1538"> Senator Margetts, certainly in my time in this chamber&mdash;just over 6&half; years&mdash;it has always been my experience that tax and accounting professionals who are involved in the interpretation and the litigation surrounding tax law have done very well in terms of the cases that have been conducted since 1936. I have not done any particular study and I do not have any particular statistics on this, but I am sure that since 1936 the amount of litigation has generally been on the increase and will continue to increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have before us any specific case where an accountant or a lawyer&mdash;people who are experts in the tax field&mdash;has been able to identify a disadvantage that will flow from this particular legislation. Given that at least part of the reason for the increasing litigation that has generally occurred since 1936 is set against the general complaints from the industry itself that the 1936 act has grown enormously in complexity and size due to changing circumstances which are, in many ways, understandable, it is certainly our hope and I think there is a reasonable expectation that the amount of litigation arising from a rewrite in a considered way will decrease over time. This matter has not been rushed. It has been dealt with broadly in its consultative phase over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the reasons why Labor initiated the examination and simplification of the tax acts which, by general complaint from everyone involved in the field, were too complex. That is why this review was initiated. What we have before us is unquestionably a much simpler and more easily understood set of bills that will simplify the income tax laws in this country when they are ultimately passed and become law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, I think the reverse is true&mdash;from your assertion, Senator Margetts, that there will be a more complex set of litigation&mdash;I certainly hope it is the case. On the advice that I have had from people in the area, we believe it is the case. For that reason and the other reasons that we have debated, we do not believe it is appropriate to support Senator Harradine's amendments on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are back to the fact that this bill commences on 1 July 1997. Have a look at 995-1. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If clause 1&hyphen;2 is enacted, the effect is that the 1936 act commences on 1 July 1997. This odd result is apparently intended, as clauses 6&hyphen;3 and 8-3 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996 state that for the 1996&hyphen;97 income year or an earlier income year, assessable income and deductions will be determined under the 1936 act. These provisions in the transitional provisions bill would appear to displace the normal rule that legislation will not be retrospective and appear to have the effect that the 1936 act, which will now commence on 1 July 1997, will retro 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spectively apply to determine assessable income and deductions for the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are a number of obligations created under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which are apparently not dealt with under the transitional provisions bill. An example is the obligation to pay withholding tax, which is created by section 128C of the 1936 act. If you assume that income subject to withholding tax has been derived during June 1997, at present section 128C(1) creates the obligation to pay the withholding tax by 21 July 1997. If the 1936 act commences on 1 July 1997, it is possible that section 128C(1) will not create an obligation to pay withholding tax on income derived during June 1997, as this is income derived prior to the commencement of the legislation. This is very relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 6-3 of the transitional bill, which deals with assessable income for income years prior to 1997-98, does not cure the problem because section 128D states that income that is subject to withholding tax is not assessable income. Nor is there any provision within the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 which appears to be relevant to this problem. It is at least a potential problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister: can he point to any provisions in the transitional provisions bill which will authorise the determination of withholding tax unpaid as at 1 July 1997 and referable to income derived before that date?</PARA></SPEECH>

But I would like to respond to the minister's suggestion that this is somehow putting in place a parallel situation in that you will be referring to the 1936 act and this particular act when passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, everybody will be referring to this particular act as passed, except the Taxation Department, possibly a few accountants and, of course, the judiciary. The point I am making to you is: that is what you have done in the legislation itself. In 1.2, as we have said before, you have referred to the 1936 act. You have said that, just because there are different words in this piece of legislation, they should not be construed as meaning there are different ideas. You did not say it the other way around, but you should have. That is what you have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ipso facto, you have done precisely what you have accused me of doing&mdash;and that is, you have said that there has to be a comparison made at some stage in the event of a dispute. Can't you see that? That is what you have done in your own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you accuse me of setting up a parallel. Obviously you have to have a parallel, if you are rewriting a piece of legislation in a simplified form; some people have to compare it at a particular stage when there is a dispute. That is what I am saying here. But I am also saying that, in that comparison, there should be no disadvantage to the taxpayer; and, if there is any ambiguity, it should be resolved and construed in favour of the taxpayer. That is all I am saying. I thought that would be a most reasonable way of saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the minister comes back. He does not say that that is all very well, but he does say that what it then does is to say that this new act cannot then be amended in a way that would place a further burden on the taxpayer because of this piece of legislation. You have to compare that to the 1936 act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With due respect, that is a nonsense. The courts always take cognisance of when the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision was inserted; thus, they do not assume that it was intended to take in later amendments. That is made perfectly clear. `Rewritten act not to disadvantage the taxpayer'&mdash;that is in my amendment, for goodness sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement made by the minister in opposition to the amendment falls. All I ask, through you, Mr Chairman, is that the committee pass these amendments which ensure that there is no disadvantage to taxpayers and, in the interpretation of the act, any ambiguity must be construed in favour of the taxpayer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We discussed also the wording of your amendment, and it is our view and the advice I have, Senator&mdash;you say that this is not correct&mdash;is that your amendment would place an indefinite cap on the amount of tax a person has to pay under the new law so that it could never exceed the amount of tax payable under the old law, regardless of what changes are made to the new law. I am sure that lawyers will argue that debate, but I think you would have to agree, Senator, that your amendment did leave itself open to that interpretation. I know you assert that that is not the case, but that is the advice I have received and I put that on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the ambiguity issue, in this country specific rules have been introduced into the Acts Interpretation Act to assist judges in finding the meaning of ambiguous material. The central theme is that the parliamentary intention is the important factor to be applied and extrinsic material is available to assist. In this bill, Senator, we have a rewrite that reduces ambiguity and uncertainty. That is one of the objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one area in which I disagree with Senator Kemp. I would not go quite as far as he does in saying that there would be another parallel tax system created as a consequence of Senator Harradine's amendments if they were carried. But I would certainly contend that if they were carried, there would be ongoing and, I would suggest, very complex and costly comparisons made in a parallel way. I think that would be the view of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our great hope&mdash;on the evidence suggested and as part of the process in the rewrite of the income tax act&mdash;is that there will be less litigation. My great hope would be that there would be no litigation, but I accept that the reality of the commercial world is such that, regrettably, lawyers, tax experts and accountants in this area always seem to find some area of debate and contention. I think that is a consequence of our legislative process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the Senate's role, obviously, to try to minimise areas of doubt, particularly where there is major concern raised. But as I have said earlier on behalf of the Labor opposition, we have not had detailed, major concerns raised about this legislation. It has been through an exhaustive process which Labor began in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had concerns raised by a number of very important accountancy organisations. I do not question the validity of their raising their concerns but I do suspect that no matter how much consultation, how many years of rewriting and attempting to simplify, we would always have some concerned individuals and organisations in the community who would want something different.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Kemp and I have said, this has been through an exhaustive process, three years of rewrite, and I do not really think we can afford to put aside the process because I do not think we will satisfy all of the competing interests and totally satisfy them that legislation is perfect. It is a significant improvement on what we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I hope we do not have&mdash;and I believe we will not have&mdash;an increase in litigation resulting from it. Our fervent hope and belief is that there will be a reduction in litigation resulting from this comprehensive, wide ranging and extensively consultative approach in the rewriting of these tax bills that will lead to a greater simplification of the system&mdash;and, particularly importantly, not just greater simplification for the purposes of the tax accountants and the tax lawyers but for the community at large to have an improved faith in our tax system and particularly our income tax system. It is necessary that it is easier for members of the community to understand and read this legislation, and that is one of the by&hyphen;products of this legislation that I hope will occur.</PARA>

Frankly, as Senator Cook said, the principle underlying your amendment would undermine the enormous strides that the mining industry has made, for example, the enormous improvement in rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not perfect. I accept that. I have seen some startling examples of the lack of perfection in Tasmania in respect of Mt Lyell, for example. Nevertheless, I think it is very important that we do not undermine specific measures that encourage rehabilitation that do go to ensuring the maximum reasonable safety levels. The mining industry is not perfect. I would be the first to say that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Terrific. The time when one should speak up about concerns about a change to any legislation, one would think, is when that change is made or the first time you find the community expresses some concern about it. Sometimes it is too late once a measure is put into a bill because then you are dealing with retrospective legislation or you are dealing with changing a system which industry then got used to and then you have a huge amount of pressure from industry not to take away something which has gained them benefit in the meantime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriate time, the right time, is to speak up when a change, which seems to have no rationale, is mooted. The government could give us no clear indications of what kind of revenue is involved. They seem to indicate there would be almost no revenue involved. That still left us in a position of not knowing what the heck they were doing putting it in in the first place. It is not about removing something that exists. Given that you have given us almost no explanation of why it is here, it is probably not appropriate to be put in because it may lead in the future to extra pressure put on to cause the construction of tailings dams of any sort to be considered as rehabilitation, which in my view, and in the view of a lot of other people in the community, is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you construct a tailings dam it is generally not about rehabilitation. It is not about environmental standards.

That is partly because of the pressure people are putting on them to make them achieve better standards. But building tailings dams is not and never was rehabilitation. Building wetlands after a mine site might potentially increase the environmental benefits, but there are also lots of areas where the digging of a hole or the building of a tailings dam is going to mean huge problems into the future&mdash;unsolved and unsolvable problems in many instances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that having a go at rehabilitation should not be fully rewarded. Near enough is not good enough. I think there is a reasonable expectation that people achieve a good standard or as best possible standard. It would be a good thing to add to their licence conditions.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, with a long mine where the income is occurring over a certain amount of time, the rehabilitation effort often occurs after that income comes through. If the bond is not sufficient&mdash;there are often very plaintive cries from mining companies as to why the bond is set at an unfair level&mdash;and problems occur later, which were not foreseen in relation to the outcomes of proposals for rehabilitation, we may well end up with a partially completed, a half completed or even an inadequate rehabilitation job. Why should a company be rewarded for such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree with Senator Kernot that the correct prospect under ecologically sustainable development is that companies pay sufficient bond so that that rehabilitation is covered by the company&mdash;and that is the real cost. The real cost of producing minerals must include the rehabilitation and environmental standards; if not, the community and the environment are being asked to shoulder the bill, which they been asked to do on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree that the reality is many people in the community think that mining companies should shoulder fair cost. But to suggest that companies should get rewarded for missing the boat, for doing a little tiny bit or for going out of business and they still get the money back would indicate very poor process. I hardly think it would be acceptable in any other kind of deductible business expenditure. Funnily enough, the environment once again loses out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I would like to say a few words about this bill. The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 implements yet another broken promise by the Howard government. In the budget, the government said it would be implementing a $40 per hour fee for voluntary mediation and counselling provided by the Family Court. This fee was due to commence on 1 January 1997 but now has been delayed. It was estimated to raise some $835,000 in 1996-97, rising to $1.9 million by 1998-99. This bill provides the mechanism to implement these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that this bill does not of itself introduce this fee. Rather, it amends the Family Law Act 1975 to permit the making of regulations that will allow the Family Court to charge the fees. It also allows for the making of regulations to provide exemptions from those fees. I understand that the proposed regulations will contain exemption provisions similar to those that apply to other fees in Commonwealth courts and tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern that the Labor Party has about the introduction of these fees is twofold. Firstly, there are the access to justice implications of slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of a service which, in fact, ultimately saves the government money because it helps to reduce the rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned at the long-term objectives underlying this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995-96 annual report of the Family Court shows that the court's counselling and mediation service dealt with 31,147 counselling and 416 mediation cases last financial year. About 60 per cent of the clients of the counselling service and 83 per cent of the mediation clients approached this service on a voluntary basis. In estimates it was revealed that 75 per cent of those cases were successfully resolved by the counselling and medi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ation service. Were it not for the provision of these services, one can only wonder how many more divorces we might have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By comparison&mdash;quite regrettably, I might say&mdash;there were 49,700 divorces in the last year alone. I do not want to suggest that any number of divorces is desirable but, clearly, the number is too high. We need to find ways of reducing the number of divorces in this country. It is in this context that the imposing of cost recovery on this service is simply bad policy. Despite the fee waiver and refund provisions, which will protect the poorest in our society, most Australians who access this service will have to incur this fee. To place a barrier to accessing a service that helps keep families together and reduces the number of cases in the Family Court is simply not good policy. Not only is there the very real personal pain and financial cost of divorce, but our entire society suffers when families come asunder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Mr Kevin Andrews, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, has suggested that all new couples should be given a voucher that would provide free marriage/relationship education. Why? Because, as he rightly asserts, this will build and strengthen more successful relationships. Surely the process of helping keep families together is just as worthy of such a sentiment. Or does the government believe that families in crisis should be treated differently&mdash;that they should be punished in some way for the failings of their relationships? I submit that they should not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to introduce these fees is a clear breach of the government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to `support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for the resolution of disputes'. A measure such as this one, which makes it harder to access mediation and counselling services, hardly `supports' or increases the options that are available to families in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech on the bill, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sought to defend the government's introduction of these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1554"> fees on three bases. The first was by reference to the need for fiscal consolidation&mdash;a problem that exists largely in the government's mind alone, with the exception, of course, of the $3 billion hole that their bungling of the economy has cost us. The second was by claiming that the previous Labor government had foreshadowed that it might consider such a proposal in the 1995-96 budget  statements. Indeed, the portfolio budget statements for that year did state that the review of court and tribunal fees was initiated by the previous government and would examine the suitability of `fee regimes for voluntary or optional services which a court might provide'. However, the Attorney fails to say that the previous government, in light of that review, rejected the introduction of fees for these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, he argued that failing to impose these fees was a form of discrimination for people living in rural and regional Australia. This argument ignores the fact that the Family Court provides extensive mediation and counselling services in rural and regional centres either through permanent offices or via circuits. Upon closer examination, the Attorney's rhetoric on this point is not only hollow; it is, in fact, hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Attorney really cared about providing services to people in rural and regional centres, he would not have cut funding to the Family Court by some $3.5 million in the last year. These cuts have led to the closure of the Mackay and Bendigo registries, the downgrading of the Launceston registry, the reduction of judicial circuits by 30 per cent and the reduction of registrar and counselling circuits by 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor would he have cut the provision of family skills training services that were to be opened under Labor's Justice Statement this financial year in the Richmond-Tweed area, the central Murrumbidgee, Shepparton-Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, Gold Coast, Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett or the Greenough River region. He would not have cut the adolescent and family mediation services that were to be provided this year and next year in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston. Nor would he have cut the family mediation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay-Burnett or Perth's south-eastern metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Attorney's insupportable arguments did not end there. In a desperate attempt to further defend his floundering case, the Attorney, in reply to speeches given by my colleagues Mr Melham, Mrs Crosio and Ms Macklin, he argued two further points. First, he argued that it was necessary for there to be greater coordination between the counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court and those provided by the community sector. However, the Attorney failed to give any reasons as to why the imposition of a $40 per hour fee would encourage this coordination. This is the case because there is no causal nexus between the two, nor obviously could there be. Secondly, he argued that there was something inconsistent about trying to encourage people to use mediation and counselling services to avoid going to court and having those services co&hyphen;located and administered by that court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The logical failing in this argument is again manifestly obvious. It demonstrates clearly this Attorney's complete lack of understanding of the role these services play. It first ignores the reality that many people facing difficulties in their relationships turn to the Family Court as a first point of call, simply because they do not know where else to go. Co&hyphen;locating a service which can deflect people in crisis from the doors of the court, or which provides them with another option as opposed to proceedings within a court, is, of course, one of the best forms of intervention and ultimately&mdash;hopefully&mdash;resolution that is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, by his comments Mr Williams seems unable to understand the very simple point that the referral of people to the Family Court's mediation and counselling service means that these matters are decided outside the courtroom. The Family Court and the court's mediation and counselling service are different yet complementary services. Co&hyphen;location of these services is one of the very real reasons why the counselling and medi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1555"> ation service has been so successful. Mr Williams's argument is therefore logically flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Attorney to pretend that this bill will mean fairer access to justice when he will cut some $320 million from access to justice programs over the next four years is the height of hypocrisy and must be rejected by this Senate. However, I am afraid there is still a more sinister agenda afoot here. The introduction of the fee is, I believe, the first step in a campaign to remove the Family Court's ability to provide mediation and counselling services altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has said that he would like to see mediation and counselling become the primary means of dispute resolution in Australia. The truth is that well before this government came along Labor was well on its way to establishing that ideal as a reality. Only five per cent of Family Court cases are resolved by way of court imposed solutions. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the parties reach an amicable solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of modern family law is that the court&hyphen;imposed solution is now the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. But in the last few months public attention has been focused, by the actions of this Attorney, on the role of mediation in our court system. The Attorney indicated his view on 2 October 1996, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like to see a reduction in the volume of mediation and counselling services provided in the court and the transfer of those to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a view he did not derogate from in his more substantive speech to the National Press Club on 15 October 1996. I recognise that in that speech the Attorney backed down somewhat from his previous comments by committing himself to extensive consultations on the issue. Nonetheless, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be freed up to concentrate on its primary function, that is to hear and determine legal disputes in family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This approach is at odds with the well recognised need to further integrate mediation into court processes. In his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration on 24 September 1996, Chief Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation and arbitration will continue to be familiar and prominent features of the system of dispute resolution in the future. There is no reason why, in the vast majority of cases, mediation should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the dispute brought to trial. But&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">let it be court attached mediation. Either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the parties, or by lot or by rotation. In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In direct response to Mr Williams's comments, and in support of the approach suggested by the chief justice, the Chair of the Family Court Council, Ms Jenny Boland, has publicly stated that the council had already advised the Attorney that the court should retain its counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in a letter of advice to the Attorney dated 30 June 1996, and annexed to the council's 1995&hyphen;96 annual report, Ms Boland advised the Attorney of the council's view on recommendation 7.26 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS>. It is this recommendation upon which the Attorney has based his view of the appropriateness of retaining counselling and mediation services within the court. Ms Boland said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented, this recommendation would destroy the successful conciliation aspects of the court's operation, it would hamper the settlement of matters particularly those involving children and result in the loss of a significant degree of expertise within the court which has benefited the interests of children, as the legislation requires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation ignores the important role played by court counsellors, mediators and registrars, and omits any reference to the extent to which the conciliation services are integrated with the litigation process. It fails to differentiate between voluntary and court related counselling, each of which requires particular skills and knowledge which the court counsellors have acquired and built over the two decades of their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council believes that what is required is the provision of appropriate primary dispute resolution processes at both the community and court levels, rather than the either/or approach adopted by the JSC.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1556">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Justice Nicholson, pointed out last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent research being conducted by Professor Thea Brown and others at Monash University has demonstrated that the only intervention which clearly leads to an early and long lasting resolution of disputes involving child abuse allegations is a reliance on family reports prepared by Court counsellors and the use of child representatives. When both are used together they are even more effective. Primary dispute resolution services provided by the Family Court have obvious and direct benefits to very vulnerable families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even Ms Helen Disney, National Director of Relationships Australia&mdash;an organisation likely to benefit if the court's counselling and mediation services were to be privatised&mdash;recognised the fundamental flaw with the Attorney's suggested approach. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best option is for the court to continue to have counselling and mediation services because of the need for those processes to be linked with the court's case management approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Family Court made similar criticisms in appendix 5 of its 1995&hyphen;96 annual report. It concluded its remarks by making an interesting point. We often talk in this place of the need to establish world's best practice in the administration of our public service: it should be no different for our courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, the government of Singapore recently decided to review the use of alternative dispute resolution services attached to its courts. After studying various models in the United States, Europe and New Zealand, Singapore decided to adopt conciliation, counselling and mediation services based on those provided by the Family Court of Australia. Fiji and South Africa are currently examining the Family Court model. Surely, if these services are good enough to export, if they are thought by others to be worthy of imitation, then we should retain those services here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems Mr Williams does not understand this. Rather, the Attorney prefers to disregard the plethora of expert advice warning him against the approach that he is taking. In a speech to the Victorian Court Network just last week, Mr Williams gave ample evidence that he has simply failed to listen to the experts on this issue. He indicated that, in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussion paper he proposes to release shortly, he will canvass the establishment of a specialised agency within the Attorney-General's Department that would eventually assume responsibility for the planning, contracting and management of all non-judicial family law services. This service will take over the management of the Family Court's counselling and mediation service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all due respect, and as the Chief Justice of the Family Court pointed out in his speech to the same conference, the Attorney-General's Department has no experience in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running of such a service. To place the management of those services in the hands of an agency that is also responsible for contracting out similar services places that agency in the centre of an extraordinary conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators, we can put into practice the advice the Attorney fails to listen to. We can stop the passage of this bill and, in doing so, we can send a strong message to the government that its old&hyphen;fashioned view that the court should be a court and nothing but a court is simply inappropriate in this day and age. The primary objective of any dispute resolution service must be to resolve disputes, and we should put in place the best mechanisms available to enable ordinary Australians to sort out their problems for themselves and as quickly and as cheaply as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Counselling and mediation are an integral part of the Family Court. It is a service that must be accessible by all. The imposition of fees that this bill will allow will create an unnecessary barrier to a service which saves both individuals and the public purse money. Mr Williams has said that, on average, families in crisis will have to pay only $240 to access this service. But, even with the exemptions that are proposed under the various regulations which will protect the most pernicious in our society, $240 is a lot of money for the average Australian family to find, particularly at a time of great crisis. Surely it would be better to invest this money in saving our families now rather than paying for the considerable human and economic costs of divorce. This is particularly so when the service in question is successful in 75 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1557"> cent of cases, a standard equal to or better than any private sector counterpart. That is a demonstrably regressive measure, and I urge the Senate to reject this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I draw to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) a report that appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> which addressed the issues being canvassed by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues concerning the child support scheme. According to this report the government is considering changes to the formula used in relation to those matters. I note that the government has not made any announcement to that effect. I ask that, in the government's response to this debate, some attention be given to whether or not those reports are in fact valid. Is this government attempting to introduce measures in that scheme? When would they take effect? What is the nature of the changes proposed?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last October my colleague Senator Stott Despoja made a number of remarks during a debate to disallow hefty increases in court fees levied by the government during the last budget. In some cases those fees were increased by as much as 713 per cent. When that occurred, the principles of common and easy access to justice effectively went out the window.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This unspecified increase in this bill is in addition to those extravagant increases last year. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja ably set out the arguments on 9 October 1996 when she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has made no bones about the fact that it expects the judiciary to provide a greater cost recovery process . . . `user pays' is a term that should have no place in the justice system in this country . . . We believe very much that the ability to walk into a court and have your grievances dealt with in a fair, efficient and just way is actually a right of citizenship. It is not a luxury. It is not an extravagance . . . The proposition that health care card holders will be given exemption denies the fact that not all deserving cases will be holding health care cards. I cannot think of anything more abhorrent than a woman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">who has been the victim of domestic violence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . having to argue why she should be exempt from filing fees.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could not agree more. Should this bill progress to the committee stage, I will be asking questions regarding the extent to which the government has factored in the impact of this fee upon women who have been subjected to domestic violence and I will be asking questions regarding other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1994-95 annual report of the Family Court of Australia, it was reported that the counselling service of the court dealt with 32,378 cases. I think that is a figure worth repeating: 32,378 cases&mdash;an increase of 7,800 on the previous year. About half of all counselling was voluntary and held before the parties filed for divorce. According to the Family Court, most of the voluntary counselling was aimed at settling issues like property 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and maintenance rather than at the reconciliation of relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) gives no indications on whom the proposed fee would be levied. I suppose the government will say that it will sort out these details when the regulations are made. But, if that is so, it is not good enough. We do not know how the fee will be imposed, whether it will be up&hyphen;front or collected at an hourly rate; nor is there any indication as to who&mdash;one or both of the parties&mdash;will pay the fee. This fee has the potential to become yet another financial issue that has to be negotiated between parties during what are ultimately quite complex financial settlements and for litigious parties to wrangle over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that many women and some men will be in an inferior bargaining position through either domestic violence or other factors, this fee has the potential to militate against them as parties in family law proceedings. The fee that this bill would usher in would cause a cost of $40 to be levied against users of those services, or so it appears. In the 1996-97 budget statements for the Attorney-General's Department, the government expects the fee from voluntary counselling to raise $835,000 in 1996-97&mdash;rising to $1.9 million in 1998-99, being the first full financial year in which the measure will take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to now pay some attention to the revolutionary changes that have occurred in family law. In general legal matters there has been a welcome shift from the adversarial system of dispute resolution towards a more alternate model that seeks the agreement of the parties through counselling, mediation and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1560"> conciliation. But in family law such methods are sometimes only partially welcome. Evidence has accumulated that alternative dispute resolution can in fact have a downside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be careful not to embrace models as complete and total solutions. Sometimes a mix of solutions is better, because many things do have a downside. By way of example, I cite the report by Dr Hilary Astor in 1991 regarding mediation and violence against women. In cases where domestic violence had occurred, that report illustrated the inappropriateness of mediation due to the relative unequal bargaining position of the victim as against the perpetrator and the psychological disadvantages of being placed in that position. Fees for these services can work as a disincentive to enter into counselling. On that basis, these fees should be condemned. The government has obviously yet again not taken into consideration the possible social and family consequences of its revenue driven approach to deficit reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even so, the Australian Democrats do support government and community moves that divest conflict from adversarial forums and work towards using the cooperative power of individuals. It is a trend that is ushering in a cultural change for users of Family Court facilities. According to the court's annual report for 1994-95, only about five per cent of cases before the court are now litigated. If nothing else, this signifies a welcome cultural shift that is occurring towards dispute resolution in this country. Testimony to this change has come from eminent lawyers in the field such as Mr David McKenna, who has practised in the family law jurisdiction for the last 33 years in suburban Melbourne. Mr McKenna reports to us that, where previously few people used to contemplate alternative dispute mechanisms or counselling, now this is relatively the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot emphasise enough that what the government is seeking here is mean spirited, tight&hyphen;fisted and, in the view of the Australian Democrats, totally unnecessary. We all know prevention is better than cure. But how do you measure prevention? We will never be able to ascertain the number of suicides and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> domestic violence cases that will not occur because of Family Court counselling and mediation. The Family Court is not a milkable deficit reduction cow; it is a sensitive social mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Counselling and mediation are preventative measures and should be seen as buffers against costly and time consuming litigation. It stands to reason that, if these buffers are removed, or at least are made unattractive to litigants or are made more difficult to access, the focus will necessarily have to be on remedial programs and shift back to litigation. For these reasons and the reasons I have outlined earlier, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting this bill and will oppose it at the second reading stage.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1560" TIME="3.29 p.m." SPEAKER="O'Brien, Sen Kerry" NAMEID="8O6" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that Senators Carr and Murray have canvassed a number of matters that I had intended to canvass. I must compliment Senators Carr and Murray for their very perceptive contribution to this debate. However, I will take the time of the Senate to talk about some of the practical concerns that practitioners in the family law area in the city of Launceston have brought to my attention&mdash;Launceston being the city in which my electoral office is based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Act 1975 allows couples to access counselling when, for example, pursuing legal remedies for residency&mdash;a term now used to describe custody matters&mdash;property settlement and, to a limited extent, paternity matters. Couples can at this stage access this counselling prior to legal proceedings at no cost. Couples who are directed to attend counselling after initial hearing can also access counselling at no cost. Of course this bill is not proposing to change the latter circumstance but only the former.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice I have received from those practitioners who have brought this matter to my attention and who have been involved in counselling within the Family Court in Launceston indicates that the process of voluntary counselling has been extremely successful and that, in the Launceston region, the statistics would show, in so far as they are kept, that there is a success rate for counselling in excess of 70 per cent, and that success can be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1561"> measured in different ways. For example, couples may, by counselling, be enabled to make a resolution not to do anything regarding their issue, so the matter never proceeds in any way to litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way in which matters can be resolved in this fashion is that couples could reach agreement which only proceeds to court to allow the agreement to be confirmed or ratified. In other words, it is a consent matter before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both of those circumstances, the process clearly not only saves the parties costs of legal proceedings or extended legal proceedings but it also saves the Commonwealth the time and money that is involved in conducting those proceedings through the Family Court. The coalition's position is hard to understand in that context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 October, the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice, Mr Daryl Williams, in an address to the National Press Club said that counselling and mediation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . should be the primary dispute resolution methods in family law, with litigation only in cases that really need it. Mediation can provide a more effective, less traumatic, and less expensive option for separating couples than litigation. It involves the parties agreeing what the issues in dispute are, agreeing to a process to consider them and attempting to reach agreement, with the assistance of a neutral third party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the proposal to introduce a fee structure for counselling is estimated, by the legal practitioners who advised me, to be likely to result in a substantial reduction in counselling usage at least at the initial stages&mdash;that is, prior to the commencement of proceedings. It is my understanding that the Attorney&hyphen;General proposes that a fee of $40 per hour for counselling be charged by the Family Court counselling service. I am also advised that the average counselling session length is 2.5 hours&mdash;apparently a fee of $100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, should people not use this option and proceed directly to court&mdash;for instance, in a defended custody case&mdash;then the court requires the development of a family report, and the production of this report takes on average three days. Therefore, the cost to the Commonwealth is higher; there is no cost recovery in those circumstances. So, what the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Attorney&hyphen;General may well be doing is increasing the cost to the Commonwealth by discouraging people from seeking their own mediation without the commencement of legal proceedings first. That will not happen in every case but cost savings are cost savings and the potential is there&mdash;and there is no need to tell the Senate or the community at large that the potential cost of litigation in all these cases is extremely high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray touched upon some of the problems of the administration of this sort of a fee, and there are a number of issues which will need to be answered at some stage. I understand that this is proposed to be addressed some time later by regulation, but I think the Senate is entitled to have some answers to these questions before this legislation is passed&mdash;if, indeed, it is to be passed. For example, what will be the fee collection process? Will couples be required to pay up front? Will the counsellors be required to add to the distressful situations by demanding the payment up front? And, if they do not demand the money up front and they seek to recover it later, who will be liable for the fee: will the couple be jointly and severally liable? Will the person who made the appointment be liable? Will the fee be pro rata&mdash;that is, for part of an hour will a part of the $40 be attracted; and how will it be ensured that the fee is treated equitably by the couple? For example, in the situation where one partner makes an appointment for counselling and the other partner goes along with it because they think it is the right thing to do; the first partner does not turn up but the second does, who is responsible for the fee? If the second partner decides to continue without counselling anyway, who is then responsible for payment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, I understands, expects in a full year to recover $1.9 million out of this fee charge proposal. That covers about 47,500 hours of counselling. This is an awful lot of counselling. If that estimate is in any way based on the current situation, it clearly demonstrates that this service has a very high level of usage and it is a dangerous proposition to be suggesting a change to a system of counselling which, obviously, according to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1562"> practitioners that I am informed by, has a great effect in resolving disputes and also in saving the public a significant amount of money because of the reduction in litigation in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been said that a fee for a service is likely to be a discouragement to use that service&mdash;and I have said that before. It is an issue which Senator Murray touched on, and I reiterate it. If people are to consider counselling and to consider the financial burden that they will face if they choose counselling, then isn't that placing a barrier in the way of the stated desirable outcome by the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;that is, to say to people, if you want counselling, you are going to have to pay for it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have another much more fundamental concern about this process. I draw the attention of senators to the comments by the Attorney&hyphen;General when he spoke to the National Press Club on 15 October. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, there is something of a contradiction between encouraging people to resolve their family law problems outside the courts, while at the same time keeping a major source of counselling, including voluntary counselling, within the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that most people would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children and property outside of the court environment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that the report last year on "Funding and Administration of the Federal Court of Australia", by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, recommended that mediation and counselling under the Family Law Act be pursued to a greater extent in the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also talks about the provision of that service while having regard to the value for money for taxpayers. Everyone would agree with that, but where you have on the one hand a proposal to strike a sessional fee for a government instrumentality&mdash;and the government alone will control the level of that fee&mdash;and on the other hand a proposal to perhaps put to tender some part of that service, the next step could well be obvious; that is, the government sets the fee for its own agency, is able to tender a lower fee for the private sector and then says, `On the basis of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our stated policy that there should be value for money for the consumer, it is not appropriate that the Family Court conduct any counselling because they are too dear and the service will entirely be handed out to private providers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may well be the ideological bent of this government, to privatise as much of the public sector as it can, but this Senate needs to ask the question: if the Family Court Counselling Service is providing an effective service at the moment, then why tamper with it, why take the risk? We have seen this government prepared in other areas to take the risk with legislation; for example, tampering with the employment services in this country. It is prepared to take the risk with this very important and very sensitive area in a way which I think is clearly designed to ultimately privatise the whole of this counselling service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in the field of justice but in the field of safety, particularly where air safety is concerned, there has been a concept abroad about affordable safety. There has been much discussion as to whether or not standards should be set at a particular level because they are affordable. There has been a very stark and proper reaction in my view to that proposition because if you are flying an aeroplane and the amount of risk you face in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1563"> doing that is increased because there is a reduction in the amount of money that can be spent on your safety, you are likely to be quite upset about the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill before us, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, is the latest bill which imposes a premium on justice. Nobody likes the idea of affordable safety and nobody I suggest should like the idea of affordable justice; that because there is a limited budget we as citizens of this country are going to be denied the full justice to which we would otherwise be entitled. One of the concerns I have with this bill is not so much with the terms themselves but with the second reading speech because when the second reading speech is read the attitude, the philosophy and the culture behind it are of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court deals with some of the most tragic situations that could possibly be imagined. It deals with families that are torn apart; it deals with the future of children, some very young; it deals with the income of spouses. There has been a terrible reaction to the way we deal with the split&hyphen;up of families, not only in terms of the financial hardship that that imposes on lots of people but on the emotional, spiritual and cultural impact that the break&hyphen;up has on lots of people. Therefore it is proper and right that the institution that deals with these problems be properly resourced and run. It is that concept that it would be good to know was behind this latest legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what the second reading speech points out. The second reading speech points out that the government has to save money and if justice has to suffer as a result of that, then so be it. If you think that that is a harsh statement on my part, I will just read the first couple of paragraphs of the second reading speech. The first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to provide a power for the Governor-General in Council to make regulations which provide for fees to be charged for use of the voluntary counselling and mediation services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is part of the government's overall budget strategy to reduce the massive budget deficit that this government has inherited. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The essence of the government's response to the $8 billion budget deficit black hole has been to make sensible reductions in outlays and increases in user charges to ensure that the burden of the need to reduce the deficit is shared across the whole community. To ensure a fair distribution, each area must play its part.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the core purposes of government is to provide justice. The three branches of government are the legislative that sets the law, the executive that carries out the law and the judiciary that interprets the law. Those three arms have been the character of government since it has been in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This second reading speech says that the Family Law Amendment Bill is about reducing the efficiency with which the third arm of government can operate. It says, `We will affect or change the way in which a particular instrument&mdash;that is, mediation&mdash;is used by the third arm of government by making it more difficult to get.' We are going to charge $40 an hour for anybody who wants to go to mediation. The second reading speech does not go into how that might affect access to justice; it details the costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This second reading speech is not the work of a person who has great dedication to the law, as the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) of this Commonwealth has. He has a great passion for the law. This is not a speech by him; this is a speech by the sorts of people that you would find in Treasury and in Finance. It is of great concern to see a trend developing whereby people are being shut out of something as fundamental as the Family Court because a saving has to be made. The second reading speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind honourable members that the cost of running the Family Court is now in excess of $100 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that says is, `Is it not outrageous that government has to pay for courts? Is it not outrageous that government has to provide the proper instruments whereby people can get justice?' The next step is to say, `Is it not outrageous that people want justice when it is going to cost?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of great concern. This bill is imposing penalties in terms of money on people approaching the instruments whereby justice is done. If there is one thing that stirs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1564"> in our breasts, if there is one thing that we are concerned about, it is that we all get a fair deal. We are not going to get a fair deal in the way that we should because it costs $100 million a year to run the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We spend billions on defence, and so we should; we have to protect the country. People do not get up and say, `You are spending billions, isn't it awful,' because everybody knows we have to be defended from potential foes. Should we not also be prepared to spend $100 million or even more to ensure that our fellow citizens are given what we all so passionately want: that is, justice before the tribunals of the land? The second reading speech goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major considerations favouring the imposition of fees in this area is the fact that the Commonwealth funds the Family Court to provide counselling and mediation services and also funds community based service providers which provide similar services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are saying, `We are very upset because we have to provide what government is all about. We have to provide instruments whereby people can be given justice. We are very upset because the government has been asked to provide instruments where people might get together and settle their disputes.' If government is not about settling disputes, if government is not about keeping peace, order and good government, what is it about? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To produce a second reading speech which complains about the function of government&mdash;an obligation set out in the constitution in section 51 to see to the peace, order and good government of the country&mdash;is not only mean spirited but also quite wrong. The second reading speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community based sector provides those services for a fee to those who can afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are private organisations outside the scope of government. If people want to go to private arbitrators or private mediators, fair enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private mediators have no responsibility under the constitution, by tradition, by common law or by the very essence of government to provide these things. The private sector does not have that obligation, but the government&mdash;the public sector&mdash;has. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what government is all about. It seems to me quite ridiculous to simply say, `Because people who have no obligation to provide mediation charge for it, the government, which does have an obligation to provide it, should also charge.' The next paragraph of the second reading speech reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for counselling mediation is such that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court services. In these circumstances, it is inequitable that a service is provided for a fee to some, often residents of rural and remote locations, but others, purely on the basis of geography, receive a similar service for free.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What it is saying is that where government does do its job&mdash;that is, provides what it is meant to provide under its constitutional obligations, which are the very essence of what government is all about&mdash;it does not charge, and that is in the city. But where government fails to do its job&mdash;where it does not give citizens of this country, people in rural areas, the services to which they are entitled&mdash;those services then are provided by private mediation. Further, because mediation is provided privately in those rural areas because government will not, the argument then is made: well, people back in the city where government does meet its obligation should also pay. It is an argument that twists the whole concept around; it twists the true concept on its head. It is a very bad approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of the second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While counselling and mediation are important, there needs to be an adequate contribution by those who use the services of all of our courts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, if you use courts, when the government does do what is needed and has provided what it is meant to provide&mdash;and when I use the word `government' here, I mean it in the sense of the three arms of government&mdash;when it does use the taxpayer's dollars to do what the taxpayer pays it to do, and that is to govern, the argument is made: well, people should not only pay their taxes for that, but should go ahead and pay extra for using the very function that government is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the last sentence on the second page of the second reading speech, it says this: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1565">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community based organisations also provide pro bono counselling services for those who are unable to pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A lot of pro bono work is done in this community. A lot of it is done by the legal profession, a profession that is often condemned and criticised&mdash;and, in most cases, wrongly. The person who wrote this second reading speech ought at least be acknowledged for this: he or she has acknowledged the vast amount of pro bono work that is done. And government is relying on pro bono work to carry out the functions that government, by its very essence, is meant to carry out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on the last page of the second reading speech, the member delivering it at least has had the decency to feel a bit ashamed of what he or she has read out up to this point. It then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to assure the House that I and the government remain committed to encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, having spent two-thirds of the speech talking about the need to satisfy those who count the dollars in the counting house, and having bowed down to those people and sacrificed the dictates of justice to the dictates of the dollar&mdash;having gone through that for two pages&mdash;the speaker suddenly feels a little bit ashamed and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to assure the House that I and the government remain committed to encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They suddenly realise, yes, the government does have an obligation. Towards the end of the second reading speech, this is said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are currently examining with the Family Court the most practical way of effecting collection of such a fee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, they do not say, `We are currently examining with the Family Court the most just, the most fair, the most equitable way of collecting such a fee.' They say, `What is the most practical way?' They do not use the word `justice' nor the word `equity' nor the word `fairness'. They just say, `Look, how can we best get this money out of these people in the most practical way?' Forget about the issue of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is all this for? It is to save $1.7 million in a full year. I am glad that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Attorney-General did not write this speech. He is a man who has a feeling for the law, a man who has spent his professional career in forwarding the interests of justice. But it is a pity that a speech such as this should have been written in his name. I believe that it is time we as a parliament, an executive and a judiciary&mdash;all being part of the government of Australia&mdash;start to deliver our obligations without attaching a price tag to them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A great speech&mdash;one that one would rather forget than remember, I think. This initiative of the government is about denying access to justice. It is about low income earners and other people who find themselves, at a very emotional and difficult time, a time of stress, faced with the fact that now in a voluntary situation they perhaps will have to cough up a lousy $40 an hour to go into some mediation process. Of course, this begs the question as to whether in the end it will be a voluntary mediation session or a compulsory mediation session ordered by the court&mdash;and I will address that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But undoubtedly this initiative is another broken promise by the government. It has been condemned by the Family Court, by family law practitioners and by service providers. It seems that there is no-one in favour of this, save for a few on the government side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything, this initiative provides a barrier to dispute resolution rather than something which will expedite it.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1566"> stress. And here we have the government trying to put onto these people a fee of $40.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is $40 an hour.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is $40 an hour. Disgusting! In this stressful period one finds that the people are generally jockeying for a financial position which is going to be advantageous for themselves because they know that inevitably the pending breakdown in their relationship will end in divorce and then they will be fighting over the goods and chattels as to who gets what. Of course, money is all-important to them at this time. Particularly if they are in the low income area, going through mediation sessions&mdash;and I understand that it is on average about 2.4 or 2.5 times that people turn up to the sessions&mdash;at $40 an hour is a financial impost that people will not be prepared to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impetus behind this is that it will be a voluntary rather than compulsory counselling session. But inevitably it is something that will go by the wayside for many people, who will not enter into it on a voluntary basis when they know that they can go to the courts and have it ordered and thereby avoid the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last year's budget the government set aside money for marriage preparation and ongoing relationship programs. Whilst that was laudable in itself and an initiative which one might applaud, all they have done is take off the back end a fee, a cost, to pay for what they are now putting up front by way of marriage preparation and ongoing relationship programs. So they are robbing Peter to pay Paul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the confrontationist situation that people get themselves into in marriage breakdown you are looking at the need for true mediation where people are going to come together and resolve their problems. I quote from last years' annual report of the Family Court of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through integration of mediation, the Court is encouraging its use as a primary dispute resolution procedure, not only with voluntary clients but also with litigants who have already filed an application. For the year, 83% of mediation clients approached the Court specifically to seek the Court's Mediation Service without filing any other application, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whereas only 17% were referred from the Court having already filed an application.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that what we are going to see as a result of this is that people will not be approaching the court for voluntary mediation and, instead of having 83 per cent&mdash;as I interpret those figures&mdash;approaching for voluntary mediation and 17 per cent being in a litigious position of having been ordered by the court to have compulsory mediation, we will see a giant reversal of those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to force people to file applications. It is going to force people to take an adversarial position because that is the circumstance under which they will be able to get hold of mediation paid by the court. This is clearly brought out at the last page. It is probably the only part of the unforgettable speech that Senator Cooney did not quote. The second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to levy fees only relates to those services used on a voluntary basis. Where the Family Court orders or directs that counselling take place no fee will be payable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is the crux of this: where people are put in an adversarial role where they have gone down the path of saying that their relationship has broken down, then the court will be in the position to order them into mediation which will be at no cost to them. Otherwise, they are going to be faced with something that is purely on a voluntary basis where they are going to be paying $40 per hour. Particularly if they are low income earners, that will hold no joy for them because, as I have already stated, when one gets to the end of one's relationship one finds oneself counting the dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that this mean&hyphen;spirited initiative by the government ends up going absolutely nowhere, because that is what it deserves. It really holds out no hope for the reconciliation process where a marriage is in the death throes or where that marriage is in real jeopardy of breaking down irreconcilably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while to look at another part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Court of Australia Annual Report 1995&hyphen;96.</EMPHASIS> Attached to the financial statements, it is the simplest outline I could find of the objective of the Family Court of Australia. I quote note 1:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1567">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Court of Australia operates in Australia to serve the interests of the Australian community by providing for the just and equitable administration of justice in all matters within the Court's jurisdiction, with emphasis in its family jurisdiction on the conciliation of disputes and the welfare of children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the objective of the Family Court of Australia as outlined in the annual report attachment to the financial statements. And if that is the objective, then the $40 per hour voluntary conciliation really stinks. It is something that the government should drop like a hot potato. It is something that has no place in the mediation process between these people. The government should be bending over backwards to repair whatever damage there might be in the relationships between people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks further into this annual report there is a little bit more interesting reading at page 122. It is the court's response to the joint select committee recommendations, which were released on 29 May 1996. The last paragraph on that page says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court considers that most of the savings to be made from an early intervention approach are savings that have allowed it to cope with an increasing volume of work over the years without an increase in resources commensurate with that volume. Early intervention has allowed an earlier resolution of cases which would otherwise have lingered on at greater expense.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet here we have today, I believe, an initiative which is going to put people into a complete adversarial role if they want to avoid a charge which this particular piece of legislation seeks to levy. To me, it is really something which we could do without in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were serious about repairing the relationship breakdowns which occur, then this charge would not be levied for voluntary mediation. It seems to me that the emphasis must be on getting people there voluntarily rather than putting them in the adversarial role which I believe this could only do. The government's action in applying the charge on a voluntary mediation or counselling is counter productive and in direct conflict to what I have been referring to. The government's approach, in my opinion, flies 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the face of the objective of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this piece of legislation should never have found its way into the parliament and shows how the government is being dictated to by the economic rationalists, as my colleague said, in both the finance and the Treasury areas. I believe that this legislation should sink.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in opposition to this Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 I would like to point out that the Howard government was elected on a promise to support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for the resolutions of disputes. Not only does this legislation make an absolute joke and farce of that promise, I believe the intentions are even more sinister and that this government is taking one of the first steps in destroying the Family Court altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly going to destroy the court's mediation and counselling service and destroy an effective service that is helping to keep many families together. Only five per cent of Family Court cases are resolved by the court imposing its own solutions. In the majority of cases, the parties reach a solution or one of the parties stops putting up a fight. Many of these cases are assisted by the mediation and counselling service. In fact, in the 1995-96 year there were 31,563 such cases. The majority of those approached the service on a voluntary basis. The fact that 75 per cent of these 31,563 cases were successfully resolved shows the success of the service and the huge benefits both socially and financially, as it is the financial aspect that this government seems to be most concerned with, of this mediation counselling service to the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't that the most important aspect of what this is all about&mdash;keeping families together rather than helping to increase the already high figure of over 49,000 divorces a year? Does the coalition really want to see more and more broken families and, worse still, even more and more such broken families in poor financial positions?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1568">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very hard to believe the Prime Minister and his government when they go into their sanctimonious mode and extol the virtues of the family unit and how important it is to the Australian community. They do not believe what they say. They do not really believe in helping to preserve the family unit. This is only their pretend mode for the media to make everyone believe that this is what the government feels and believes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the crunch this government throws all  those pretences out of the window. This bill proves that they could not care less whether families stay together or not. The true nature of the coalition's support for the family unit is on display in this debate. In promoting and supporting this bill they do not support the family at all. In fact they are quite intentionally displaying a couldn't care less attitude by forcing many children to forgo the Family Court's mediation counselling service simply because they will not be able to afford to pay for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is $40 for each service or $90 for a private counselling service once this government forces the closure of the court counselling services the fact remains that it will severely discourage the use of any such services. The deception is that this will lead to the closure of the court counselling services. One has already closed in my home state of Queensland. The people of Mackay and surrounding areas are no longer able to use the services of the Mackay counselling subregistry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When couples reach the stage where they contemplate legal remedies to resolve their differences, the government of the day, especially one that purportedly believes so strongly in the family unit, should be endeavouring to help these families resolve their difficulties, not putting impediments in their way. This government is asking couples who are facing  difficulties in their relationships&mdash;and financial pressures usually are a significant part of their difficulties&mdash;to pay for counselling. That will only compound those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is asking couples who might be trying to split their furniture and belongings in a fair way to pay for mediation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to resolve those property settlements, thereby making it even harder for them to keep the property. Many couples may be forced to sell some of their furniture and belongings to pay the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it is usually women who are most financially affected by separation, due to the fact that most earn less than men or do not work at all because they are at home raising their families. They and their children will be even further financially disadvantaged by the fees that this government plans to impose on many of them. Where is this government's compassion for those families who are already going through one of the most traumatic periods of their lives? We all know that family breakdown is often racked with acrimony and bitterness, causing enormous stress and heartache to everyone involved. The answer, obviously, is that the government have no compassion. The election is over and therefore all their false compassion has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, the government has given couples one more reason for mediation. Now, thanks to this government, they will also be able to fight over who is going to pay the mediation and counselling fees. I think this government has forgotten the reasons for the original introduction of court counselling and mediation services. One of the reasons was the need to reduce the expensive legal and court fees that often accompanied family law matters, and another reason was the need to reduce the workload of the family court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the mediation and counselling services of the court are successful in helping couples come to an agreement or in bringing them back together, isn't that what this service is all about? Shouldn't we be trying to save marriages, shouldn't we be trying to reduce the number of divorces and shouldn't we be trying to help keep families together&mdash;especially if there are children involved? Not only is this service there to assist families, it is also helping to reduce the costs of the court by reducing the number of cases the court has to hear. The service is essential to families. It is essential for the security and often protection of the children in these families, as the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1569"> children are the ones who are affected the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, and probably in other states, the waiting time for a court hearing is set in excess of one year from the directions hearing. I can see the workload of the Family Court increasing dramatically over the years to come. The reason for the increase in the workload will be that some couples will decide not to go through what will now be expensive counselling and mediation. Another major reason will be that couples, of their own accord, or because of advice from their lawyers, will realise that if they appear before a registrar or a judge they can be ordered to undertake mediation and counselling. When such counselling and mediation is ordered by the court it is, of course, free. So why not wait for a judge to make such an order? As a result, the workload of the courts and the extra waiting time involved will only exacerbate the marital problems and the anguish that the partners involved, and particularly the children, will be forced to endure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this will not save the government $1.9 billion over the next few years. Instead, the extra work of the court will add costs to the system. It makes you wonder whether this was simply a Treasury slash which the minister and cabinet blindly followed without thinking the process through logically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families&mdash;particularly women, because they are often the losers financially&mdash;need access to free court linked mediation and counselling services. It is not only the financial savings that are important in being able to access the court's mediation and counselling services, it is also the added authority that a service connected to the court brings to the situation. This authority is extremely important for women who may be trying to escape an abusive marriage and who might be easily bullied by an aggressive partner. Chief Justice Brennan has publicly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason why, in the vast majority of cases, mediation should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the dispute brought to trial. But let it be court mediation. Either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties, by lot or rotation. In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jenny Boland, Chair of the Family Law Council, has also come out strongly in favour of the retention of the court's counselling and mediation services. She has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If changes such as those proposed were implemented, this recommendation would destroy the successful conciliation aspects of the Court's operation. It would hamper the settlement of matters, particularly those involving children, and result in the loss of a significant degree of expertise within the court which has benefited the interests of children, as the legislation requires.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to detail how important the roles of the court councillors, mediators and registrars are and the extent to which the conciliation services are integrated with the litigation process. She also lamented the failure to differentiate between voluntary and court related counselling, each of which requires particular skills and knowledge which the court councillors have acquired and developed over a 20&hyphen; year period. She pointed out that appropriate community and court based dispute resolution processes were both important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, if it is passed, will be a giant step backwards for Australia. It will mean that people who would benefit most from counselling and might have the greatest need for it will not seek it. It is $40 for one counselling session, $80 for two sessions and $120 for three sessions, and so on. Ordinary Australians cannot afford that. They are already going through emotional trauma and additional financial expenses because of their marital predicament. They also have to pay a fee of $460 if they are filing for divorce&mdash;a $92 or 25 per cent increase on the previous fee. Non&hyphen; divorce application fees are $250. How much more does this government want these people to pay? Are they not going through enough anguish and financial suffering as it is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is, of course, on top of the legal aid cuts that the Attorney-General is implementing. What will happen to the 18,000 to 20,000 women who have previously received legal aid funding and the tens of thousands more who receive telephone and initial advice from duty lawyers? Now, thanks to this government, they will face the prospect of no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1570"> free legal advice on family law matters and no free mediation or counselling assistance. This is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government hopes to save $1.9 million per year by charging for the counselling and mediation services. I have already outlined why I believe that this figure is very doubtful. Even if $1.9 million could be saved, is this relatively small amount so important to the government and so significant that it is worth all the associated anguish and suffering to the families that it claims to represent?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, can I thank honourable senators for their contribution today. I will deal with a number of points they made in turn. Firstly, let me say that this government is committed to the concept of primary dispute resolution. Indeed, in our policy document before the election, the government stated that it would `support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options in the resolution of disputes'. On 15 October last year, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) stated in his address to the National Press Club in Canberra:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is firmly committed to giving families alternatives to litigation when marriages break down, so that couples themselves can work out how to share their responsibilities for children and divide their property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently enacted Family Law Reform Act 1995 encourages a much greater use of counselling and mediation in family law matters. These should be the primary dispute resolution methods in family law, with litigation only in cases that really need it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I highlight that latter comment for the benefit of the opposition. The Attorney-General is clearly saying to the people of Australia that we as a government believe it is always best for people to sort out their problems in relation to the family law area by consensus, by negotiation, by mediation&mdash;and, hopefully, reconciliation can even be achieved. On that point of reconciliation, I might point out that on 20 August last year, the Attorney-General announced: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meeting its election commitment to invest in the future and security of relationships, the Government will spend an additional $6.1 million over the next three years to expand the availability of preventive marriage/relationship education services. More than 81,000 additional clients will have accessed the services which support and strengthen Australian marriages and relationships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, to date some 34 centres have been approved across the nation for this purpose. Nothing can be clearer than that the government wants to, wherever possible, retrieve a marriage which is on the verge of breaking down. The government acknowledges that the rate of matrimonial breakdown in this country is just too high. But, of course, once people go to court, counselling is still needed and a number of issues have to be resolved which may not include the questions of reconciliation. So it is that we have had counselling services operating in the court environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senators from the other side have said that, by bringing in a fee for these counselling services, you will deter people from using those services. But I put it to the opposition that in the community sector there have been fees charged for some time and that this proposed legislation is to bring about equity so that the same situation applies to those counselling services in the courts. If fees were a deterrent, why are we looking at some three times the number of people going to the community agencies rather than using the services in the Family Court of Australia? That speaks volumes, because you have more people going to the community agencies where a fee is charged than you have going to the Family Court itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Opposition senators also said that this fee would be an impediment to people achieving some form of reconciliation. But the figures show that some 41 per cent of litigants in the Family Court go to counselling after filing an application. At that stage you have people who are in the process of litigation because they have filed an application, and some 40-odd per cent of them are at that stage going to counselling. I would submit that the chances of achieving a reconciliation there are much slimmer than they are prior to filing an application. Of course, a fee in that instance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1571"> does not strike at the heart of reconciliation at all. I put it to the opposition that that is a furphy. Indeed, so was the $240 suggested by Senator Carr, because he said a family could be looking at $240 for counselling, when what we are looking at on the grounds of parity is a fee in the region of $40 a session. This was touched on by Senator Gibbs, Senator Hogg and I think Senator O'Brien as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was Senator Murray who asked how this will impact on the domestic violence, and I think Senator Gibbs raised that as well. I put it to the Senate that, in fact, most restraining orders are taken out in the Court of Petty Sessions and the various states have discrete legislation which deals with this. The greater number of applications for restraining orders come before a magistrate in a Court of Petty Sessions rather than before the Family Court, and you do not have a Family Court counselling service there in that situation. I would put to Senator Murray and other concerned senators that what you need is urgent relief in those situations, and that is what happens in the magistrate's courts. Sometimes it is not possible to even have counselling before you get to that position. But, in any event, the majority of these applications are in a Court of Petty Sessions rather than in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, regulations will be dealing with how these fees are applied. Negotiations are under way with the Family Court of Australia to work out who is to pay and how it is to be applied. At this stage&mdash;and I give no undertaking on this aspect&mdash;it is looking as though the fees could be shared equally between the parties. If one party is well off, they could pay a fee; if the other one is not, then the fee could be waived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that point of waiver, much has been said by the opposition in relation to the question of this fee being imposed on those who cannot afford it. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we have is a similar situation to the waiver which applies to those fees which are charged for applications in the Family Court, and some 40 per cent of applications in the Family Court are waived due to the impecuniosity of the person concerned. If 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you are on legal aid, if you have a health card or if you can show that your financial circumstances are such that you cannot afford the fee, the application fee will be waived. The same situation applies in relation to these proposed counselling fees. So it will not be a bar to those people who cannot afford to pay it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition stated that this was a budget measure. Senator Cooney touched on that. I say to Senator Cooney that it would be an ideal world if we could allow justice to be available without any thought as to cost. These days the judicial system is a costly system. Even the courts themselves have taken steps to restrict the hearing of cases and the unnecessary prolonging of cases. This is quite justifiably so because we only have a limited dollar to go around in relation to the judicial system. The Family Court itself costs in excess of $100 million per annum to run. It is only reasonable that this government looks at some form of cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the filing fees, I remind honourable senators opposite that the states have a higher rate of cost recovery than the Commonwealth. In fact, the Commonwealth has recovered costs in excess of 50 per cent less than the states in relation to the running of courts. It was well overdue to look at filing fees and fees for counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that under the previous government a fees review was under way. In the 1995-96 estimates there was provision for these filing fees that have been mentioned and, indeed, the previous government was looking at the very same thing. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the opposition can come in here today and say, `This is the worst thing to happen to the Family Court since its inception; these fees have struck at the heart of the judicial system', because the previous government was looking at it itself. It was looking at it because of the cost of justice in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These fees that have been attacked by the opposition are not being brought in because this government necessarily feels like it or just on a whim thought that it would be a good idea. It was a thought through process whereby we had to look at every aspect where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1572"> there could be some cost recovery to offset the running costs of the Family Court of Australia. In that there is a safety net, as I have said, where some 40 per cent of people have had their application fees waived in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This question of regulations covering the fees concerned has been raised by the opposition. These regulations are disallowable. They will be subject to the scrutiny of this chamber. No doubt, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances will be having a look at these regulations. These regulations could cover the aspect of who would pay and how it would be applied and the detail would be in the regulation. There is nothing untoward in that. Throughout the whole spectrum of the federal government's jurisdiction, there are fees imposed by way of regulation. Those regulations are subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to bring about some parity between the Family Court of Australia and the wider community and agencies such as Centacare and Relationships Australia, who charge a fee. They too have waivers, just as this proposed legislation will have a waiver provision. No-one will be disadvantaged. Although the cost recovery in the first instance is somewhat modest&mdash;I think $0.8 million in the first year and $1.9 million in the second year would be recovered&mdash;nonetheless, they would all go towards lessening the general cost of running the Family Court. It would not be done at the expense of those litigants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I reiterate that this government is committed to primary dispute resolution. It is committed to saving those marriages which can be saved. It has announced an extra $6.1 million to be spent on that very subject. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) has said, the way family intervention orders are obtained varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address the matter of domestic violence, which I think Senator O'Brien raised. I did touch on that matter. Suffice to say, most applications for a restraining order are made in courts of petty sessions, governed by discrete state legislation. That is a court which is not sitting as a Family Court, and that is a very different situation. You have immediate relief or urgent relief granted in those sorts of instances. So there is not the facility for counselling in those courts. In relation to domestic violence, counselling is really looked at in another venue, more likely in a community agency or subsequently once the matter gets to the Family Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, initially, in domestic violence situations, you have one partner going to the court for an urgent restraining order, and that being either granted or not granted. If it is granted, that puts a hold on things and then counselling is subsequently sought. So it is not a matter of putting the counselling before the restraining order; the restraining order normally is granted before any counselling is undertaken. So, as a question of whether this would impact on domestic violence, I think not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, there is a waiver application. If the person concerned&mdash;and this is only if they go to the Family Court of Australia&mdash;has a health card, is in receipt of legal aid or fits the bill of `otherwise financial hardship', as I have mentioned to Senator Harradine, there would be a waiver. We expect some 40 per cent of those people who would apply or would go to counselling would be exempted. That is again from the rate of waiving fees for applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to how this will be administered, this is currently the subject of negotiation with the Family Court. Such aspects as to the method of payment are being looked at. It is envisaged that payment would be made on the day, that there would be some sort of billing process at the conclusion of the counselling and that the parties would be equally responsible. If one party is in a lesser financial position than the other, then it stands to reason that that party could make an application for a waiver; whereas the other party, due 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to their respective financial situation, would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you have a situation where one person is left with the care and control of the children and is not enjoying a position where they are employed, then they could make that application for a waiver and the other party would not be eligible. So you would have that situation there. But, as I say, these are matters which are being looked at by way of regulation. Those regulations will be disallowable and negotiations are under way. But, of course, I will take up with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) your concerns.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in relation to the comparison of those people who seek counselling at the Family Court as opposed to the community agencies, the best I can advise you at this stage, Senator Harradine, is that, in the year 1995&hyphen;96, some 31,500 people sought counselling in the Family Court jurisdiction. In the year 1994&hyphen;95, some 90,000 people sought counselling in the community sector.

So, in round terms, you would have one to three when comparing how many go to the Family Court for counselling to those who go to the community agencies such as Relationships Australia and Centrecare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Governments, unfortunately, do not have a crystal ball. It is very hard to hypothesise in these sorts of circumstances because you are dealing with human behaviour. To indulge in prognostication in relation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1579"> human behaviour is a very risky exercise at the best of times. One does not know whether there will be more litigants this year or the next year, but I dare say that if human nature is true to form it will be on the increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Murray that all the government could be fairly expected to look at is other jurisdictions within the country. When you look at the way people access the courts in the various states, you can get a good idea as to the access that people are enjoying to those courts. I do not think that is an unreasonable base to use when looking into the future. I do not think the government could have done any more to work out a model. In some aspects, modelling can be successful. However, it is a hard task to look at the number of people suing each other, or the number of people using the courts to seek remedies for matrimonial breakdown, and work out with accuracy where it is going to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the approach of the government was quite sound in saying, `In the states you have this rate of cost recovery which seems to work. People do not seem to be saying that this is too much; that they cannot go and exercise their rights in the courts.' We looked at the local court, district courts, the Supreme Court in Western Australia and the equivalent in other states. There was a good cross&hyphen;section in relation to the rate of cost recovery from the small cases to the large cases. I think that was a fair approach by the government. It could not have done any more. In any event, the government will have a clearer picture by the end of June this year, which is only a few months away. Those figures will then be available to this chamber for assessment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the package of telecommunications bills 1996 as listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . When stacked up, this package can be seen to total 400 to 500 pages of legislation, memoranda, explanatory notes and second reading speeches. The process of preparation surrounding these bills which now are before us to be debated has been going on for some two to 2&half; years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is known, of course, that the previous Labor government, when changing the structure of telecommunications in Australia in 1991-92 to allow competitive carriers into the marketplace, at the same time announced that on 1 July 1997 the regulatory regime would be deregulated, that there would be no limit to the carriers and service providers and that full&hyphen;blooded competition would be allowed. I think as early as 1995, the then minister Mr Lee started the process of drafting this package of bills. That process was substantially completed when the government changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) continued that process at further forums and discussions. The bills were introduced into the parliament in late 1996. By agreement with the opposition here in the Senate, the bills immediately went 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to an ERCA legislative committee for final examination&mdash;and not in any way to delay the bill, but to develop a process whereby consultation with interested parties could be had in a constructive atmosphere so that senators could be educated about the full nature of the scope of these bills and deal with any amendments that may be proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said when the report from the committee was tabled a few weeks ago, that process was extremely constructive. I think that having a round&hyphen;table type of committee with almost everybody at the table, all being recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, with senators being able to get people to argue amongst themselves on different viewpoints and then asking departmental representatives what they thought of proposed amendments&mdash;and I acknowledge Mr Shaw and his officers, who at present are in the advisers box, who sat patiently through all of that&mdash;was a very constructive arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been noted as a great devotee of Senate procedure in this place or as having any great interest in it, but I would want to say to the Procedure Committee that the performance of the ERCA legislative committee in the way this matter was handled is actually a model that should be used for a lot of legislation&mdash;where you get the contending interest groups at the table at the same time and they argue with each other rather than with the committee members and then you can ask questions to elucidate more information and to create the argument. It means that you are much more quickly able to make a judgment about the merits of the argument because people are there at the same time. I would have thought that Senator Allison from the Democrats and the government members would all agree that the process was very constructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that process, the government has now tabled its report, and I congratulate the government on taking up so many of the unanimous recommendations from the committee, representing the government, the opposition and the Democrats. Although we put in minority reports on certain aspects, the majority of the recommendations were supported by all parties. That support was gained 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1581"> from a spirit of compromise on all sides, even though individually you might not have absolutely supported one particular recommendation as it came out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of last week the government circulated their response to all members of the Senate committee. It is a daunting document that goes for some 93 pages of further amendments, explanatory memoranda and notes. But overwhelmingly the government had dealt with the unanimous  recommendations of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the clerks of the Senate well in putting all of it into a running sheet for the committee stage of the debate, together with amendments that will be coming from the opposition, the Democrats and maybe the Greens. I hope that we can do that expeditiously and sensibly to make sure we keep our wits about us in handling these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition and the Democrats both put in minority reports covering a number of very important areas. The opposition certainly acknowledges that overwhelmingly we are in support of this bill. Why would we not be? When we were in government we started the process, the theme and the principles in this bill, and it would be hypocritical of us, to say the least, if we totally opposed the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain areas we want to raise in which we believe improvements can be made to this legislation, and we will be moving amendments accordingly in the committee stage. I am pleased to note that on two of our recommendations the government has already basically accepted opposition suggestions&mdash;on the issue of industry development and on the issue of making sure there is no possibility that major infrastructure, such as telecommunications and the like, can be declared as low impact. We welcome the government's acceptance of those amendments from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has also had informal discussions on a continuing basis with the government, the minister and his staff on other areas where we still have differences but where maybe we can reach a compromise. There has also been very constructive discussion with the Democrats in a number of areas. In the end, I would be surprised if we get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complete agreement in every area but that discussion has been the theme for handling this bill through the Senate committee and subsequent to its report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas where the opposition will be putting strong amendments and arguing for them include, first of all, what is called carriers' powers and immunities. We believe absolutely that local government, representing the local community, must have the right to appeal against the construction of major telecommunications infrastructure in Australia&mdash;whether it be mobile telephone towers, microwave towers or overhead cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That issue is now far too strong in the community to allow the old system of complete immunity under the federal constitution from people being people being able to object to such developments. The government, the opposition and the Democrats have strongly supported an appeal process. The debate we now have is what form the appeal process will take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has put forward a proposition that the codes of practice in many areas of how the appeal process and the planning provisions will operate will be left to the states. The opposition opposes that. We believe that the development of a sensible, national telecommunications system means that that responsibility should remain with the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore propose that national guidelines be prepared for all of Australia after an open, consultative process with local and state government, carriers and interested parties in the community, and that when that document is prepared by the ACA it should become a disallowable instrument in the parliament. Of course, that means that from time to time as circumstances change it can be amended, added to and changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that once that is established, when there is a dispute between a carrier and a local government, under our model we want to say if that council objects to the carrier or the carrier cannot get agreement with the council one or other of the parties can appeal direct to the ACA for determination&mdash;an independent body to weigh up the national interests of a telecommunications system with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1582"> the local concerns in the community. I believe that is a simple, cost&hyphen;effective way which means that this parliament will have discharged its duty properly in its constitutional responsibility for telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposal is different in that it relies on the state government stepping into what I think is an unnecessary void being created. They would then draw up their own guidelines, which means you will end up having six state and two territory sets of guidelines. By their very nature they will be different. I believe this leads us to move away from a national responsibility and national guidelines. Even if a state planning authority is appealed to, in the end if one of the parties disagrees in most cases they will be able to appeal to the ACA. I believe it is an unnecessary step in the middle that is unnecessarily complicating and is expensive to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put to the government on several occasions variations about how we could get a compromise between the minister's position and the opposition's position. One that the opposition is willing to discuss with the government&mdash;and I put on the record here&mdash;is that the federal parliament and what will be the ACA draw up a national guideline that is available across Australia so that when a state planning appeal authority is dealing with an appeal they would have a national guideline to look at to see whether the issues of telecommunications were being properly dealt with in that guideline, which, as I say, is a disallowable instrument in this parliament. This parliament maintains the oversight of that guideline but the minister still gets the state planning process into the system. I believe that is a reasonable compromise which the opposition is willing to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We absolutely believe the immunity to lay overhead cables must end at midnight on 30 June. Carriers have been told since 1992 that the immunity will end on 30 June 1997. They should plan accordingly. The government's proposal to extend that by another three months to complete the roll&hyphen;out is not extending immunity; it is playing semantics. The community is expecting, and has been told for a long time, that the immunity will end on 30 June. I think the parliament should stick to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that and we will be supporting an amendment accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe those communities that now have extensive overhead cables rolled out should have some long-term plan available to them to have the cables put underground. We will be moving some amendments. We accept the fact that there are some parliamentary procedures in moving an amendment to impose levies on carriers. Only the House of Representatives can introduce a levy or a taxing bill; it cannot be done from the Senate. But at the very least we believe this is an area that the parliament cannot walk away from. Unless communities that have overhead cables can see in the intermediate to long term there is some process to get rid of them, there will be consistent antagonism in the community against the carriers on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, we believe that the communications towers, et cetera, should no longer have any risk of being classed as low impact and therefore be exempt. We also believe that in the future all overhead cables, even those below 13 millimetres diameter, which is the government definition, have to go underground. I think that is the very minimum the community will ask us to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned industry policy. We are pleased the government has accepted the opposition's amendment for the minister for industry to be able to sanction carriers when they promise industry development programs but do not carry them through. I note that we are doing this not in a way that puts us out of kilter with the World Trade Organisation arrangements. This is being done in accordance with World Trade Organisation rules. I think if anyone else from America or Europe wants to have a go at us it ought to be put on the record now that this is not contrary to the WTO rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area in which we still have differences with the government is the area of pricing arrangements and services to the country areas. Competition is coming to the cities for local loop telephone calls. Optus, if they can gets its overhead cable to work for telephony, have said they will offer local call rates at 20c 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1583"> in markets like Sydney and Melbourne. When those local call rates are offered in the city they should also be offered in rural and regional areas of Australia so that country people get the benefit of competition directly, even though they may not have a competitive market of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want to have the re&hyphen;run of the argument about petrol. In country areas there is angst against the petrol industry that there is no reduction, no discounting, of petrol in rural areas; it is only in the city. Quite rightly, country people feel hard put upon about that. We do not want the rural areas feeling that there is a two-tiered price system operating, discriminating against the country. We will be moving an amendment accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that by the year 2000 we ought to guarantee all Australians will have the availability of digital data capability&mdash;that is, on-line services of 64 kilobits per second, which is a substantial improvement on the present power available of on-line services for Internet and so on. It is very important that our rural areas get access to the same capacity as our city areas. At the moment the government is saying that 94 per cent will be available. It is the last six per cent that is difficult. I agree that it is difficult and that it could be costly, but I believe that you do not have to lay all the infrastructure out. You can do it in a way that when someone wants it you provide the service so that they can get access to digital data capability even in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want our farming community and our small business community in rural and regional Australia to be internationally competitive they have to have access to the latest communication system. They have to be able to connect to their marketplace elsewhere in the world or elsewhere in Australia. If they do not have access to the same level of communications on-line services they will be disadvantaged and accordingly not be as profitable and not be as prosperous. This is an important issue for the opposition, and we hope that the government can support our amendment in this area. They have come a long way in supporting this, but the last bid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to ensure the last six per cent get it by the year 2000, I believe, is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other amendments we have, which some people might say are a little bit more esoteric to the general public, that deal with competition notices and tariff filing notices. We believe that Telstra should file tariff notices so that the ACCC can see what the dominant carrier is charging and, if necessary, can take action if it believes it is acting in an uncompetitive way. We believe that tariff filing notices should be compulsory for a period into the future. We also believe that the service providers should have reasonable access in the transition period to competitive prices from the carriers. Again I say that that is not an issue that the general public are overwhelmingly besotted with. But if you really want to develop a broad based telecommunications system with all its services growing, the service providers have got to be given reasonable access to the interconnect fee that is available to carriers between themselves. We believe our amendment in this area is very useful indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we will of course be supporting amendments to guarantee that business on&hyphen;line services get a standard flat rate untimed local call charge. As it is at the moment, we do not accept the position of the government or the carriers that automatically that is going to jam them. We think that with new technology this should be seen as a new business opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, the opposition overwhelmingly supports this bill, but in the areas I have outlined we believe we have important amendments that will enhance the outcome of this package of bills. That will mean that we have a robust and healthy telecommunications services industry in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Greens (WA) I would start by noting the criticisms by both the Australian Democrats and community groups of the Senate inquiry into this package of telecommunications bills. The time given to groups to submit evidence to the inquiry was inadequate and it seems that not enough simple information on, and explanation of, the intent and detail of the bills package was given. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the terms of reference for the inquiry called for specific legislative amendments from those making submissions. This is a completely unreasonable request that seems to have been designed to stifle input rather than encourage it. It is one of the things that could have been encouraged, but often it is used to intimidate people. All in all, it was clearly not a great moment in community consultation. It poses a question: if this legislation is so clearly of benefit to consumers, as we are told so often, why is the government reluctant to hear consumers' opinions of it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned about the regulatory structure contained in the new legislation. The proposed act will rely on self&hyphen;regulation of telecommunications with codes of practice. Yet when it comes to the provision of such an essential service as telecommunications, we would like to see a stronger and more binding regulatory scheme introduced. Of particular concern is that the industry codes will be voluntary. If we are to have self&hyphen;regulation based on codes of practice surely, at a bare minimum, compliance with the codes should be compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last week in this place we debated amendments to the Trade Practices Act relating to access to infrastructure services such as electricity, gas and water in our newly competitive economy. Some of the issues raised in that debate are relevant today. Our general concerns with the telecommunications bills relate, as they did last week, to matters of the public interest and the need to ensure that competition does not override the need to protect the public interest. As with the bill last week, we do not believe that enough has been done. We will be moving amendments to the bill and, unless they are adopted, we are not able to support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week's Industry Access Codes Bill contains inadequate provision for protection of the public interest. It stipulates that when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is assessing a code for an infrastructure industry, it is required to give consideration to `the public interest, including the public interest in having competition in markets'. We pointed out that this was a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> narrow description of the public interest and that it did not take into account that in many cases competition was against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill's attempt at describing the public interest is even worse. Part 6 of this bill deals with industry codes for sections of the telecommunications industry. Section 111 specifies the general principles. It states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ACA, in exercising its powers . . . will act in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACA, enables public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not impose undue financial and administrative burdens on participants in sections of the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This statement is very revealing. It puts one thing completely beyond doubt as to the intent of competition policy. It is designed to maximise corporate profits and the sale price of Telstra, not to enhance the interests of the consumers&mdash;let alone the wider community. Section 111 then goes on to state that when determining whether public interest is jeopardising corporate profits, the ACA must give regard to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the public interest in having competition in markets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an even worse description than that contained in the recent Industry Access Codes Bill. That bill at least referred to `the public interest including the public interest in having markets'. The definition at least allowed for the possibility that public interest could mean other things. The Telecommunications Bill, however, has dispensed with this nicety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complete inadequacy of this definition of public interest is revealed by the next section of the bill, section 112, which outlines `matters that may be dealt with by industry codes and industry standards'. These include: the internal handling of customer complaints, debt collection practices and disconnection of customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What is clear from just these few examples is that there is a great need for a much wider definition of the public interest to be used by the ACA when considering codes. How does competition protect the public interest with regard to issues of debt collection or disconnection? Principles such as social equity are central to the consideration of these issues, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1585"> and they must be spelled out in this legislation. We will move amendments which seek to have these principles included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have other specific concerns about this bill, including a concern about the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme&mdash;or should I say ombudsperson because it is not yet in legislation. Clause 236 of the Telecommunications Bill stipulates that carriers and eligible carriage service providers must enter a scheme providing for a Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, or TIO. This is something that we welcome, and we hope that the government will give this person the resources and facilities necessary to do their job properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, clause 237 then gives the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, the power to exempt a carrier or eligible carriage service provider from the obligation to enter the TIO scheme. What is the rationale for this? I fail to see a situation where the ACA could justify deciding that a carrier should be exempt from an oversight scheme that other carriers are a part of. I would welcome the government explaining this part of the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Further to this scheme, the report of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee recommends that the definition of `eligible service providers' be extended to include Internet access providers and Internet service providers. They could then be included in the TIO scheme. I think this is sensible and I would urge the government to accept this suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Clause 22 of this bill gives the definition of the `boundary of a telecommunications network'. The boundary is that point to which the carrier's obligations extend. The boundary is defined in regulations or, when there are no regulations, this bill sets down definitions. In the case of services provided by a line that enters a building, the boundary is the building entry point; that is, the point at which the line meets the outer surface of the building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a regressive step, it would seem. In the current act, the boundary for most consumers is defined as the wall socket in their house. This is specified in the legislation. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would like to see this carried over to the new legislation; otherwise, we are concerned that this bill's new definition of the boundary as a building entry point will be adopted to the disadvantage of consumers. For instance, for someone living in a large block of units, the boundary at which the carrier is responsible is currently the wall socket. If a problem arises up to that point, the carrier is responsible for dealing with it. If the boundary is moved back to the building entry point, then any problems arising between the entry point and their apartment could be the responsibility of the building's owner. All this does is make it more difficult for consumers to have problems with their telecommunications services fixed. We would urge the government to revert to the definition contained in the current act, and we will be moving amendments to protect residential customers in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Turning to the universal service areas: we have had representation from the Consumers Telecommunications Network, or CTN, pointing out the need to extend the definition of a `universal service area' to cover non-geographically defined loss&hyphen;making services that constitute a public benefit. This was supported by the standard telephone service review. What this means is that a designated service area could include things such as individual pay phones. As an example, a pay phone in a disadvantaged area of Sydney may operate at a loss but be heavily relied upon by local residents who may not be able to afford a telephone service in their homes. As such, it should be declared a universal service area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also strongly support the recommendation that a levy be incorporated into the annual carrier licence charge which will be used to fund consumer representation and research into social policy aspects of telecommunications related issues. The issue of low-impact facilities is also of great concern. The bill does not define low-impact facilities, yet is giving low-impact facilities immunity from state and local planning and environment laws. Austel is currently conducting an inquiry into what is a low-impact facility, yet the government is now expecting us to give these facilities immunity before this is deter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1586"> mined. I understand the Democrats are moving to delete the immunity for low-impact facilities from the legislation, and we will be prepared to support this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be moving an amendment which appears to be a concession to concerns that consumer bodies will not be consulted when the ACA determines, varies or revokes an industry standard. A new section, section 131A, has been added which directs that the ACA must consult `at least one body or association that represents the interests of consumers'. However, while this might seem to be a reasonable step, it might be meaningless. `At least one' body effectively means one, and which one body will be consulted? Most likely the one which gives the least difficult and challenging point of view. How do we know that this body can be taken as representative of consumers as a whole? If the ACA is committed to consulting one consumer body, then surely they could just as easily consult others and thus get a broader and more representative view of the opinions of consumers. We would urge that this amendment be altered. I intend to move our own amendment to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Then there is the issue of overhead cabling. Although the government will be moving amendments which are an improvement on the existing situation, it is still inadequate. What is needed is clear legislation that all future cabling will go underground and that existing aerial cabling will be replaced with underground cabling. I would note that we seem to be behind the rest of the developed world in this regard. For example, I understand that underground cabling has been required in Germany since the early 1980s. Once again, corporate interests appear to be overriding community interests. I will be saying more on these matters at the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the associated bills, I wish to raise just a few of the concerns that I have with this legislation. It is not only members on this side of the chamber who have some concerns with these bills; in fact, ministers Cooper and Veivers, the two Queensland National Party 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ministers responsible for the emergency services in my home state, have written to Senator Alston on at least two occasions expressing their concern about the weaknesses of the proposed legislation in respect of emergency call services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 255 of the bill&mdash;provision of emergency call services&mdash;is simply not strong enough. This is a section of the bill that deals with life&hyphen;threatening and time critical situations. This is a section of the bill that will help determine the effectiveness of emergency calls to the ambulance, fire and police services. This section should therefore be quite prescriptive. It should set out the minimum requirements that will ensure the health, safety and well-being of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause (2) of clause 255 states that each telephone user should have direct access, free of charge, to an emergency number unless the ACA considers that it would be unreasonable for such access to be provided. Under what circumstances would the ACA consider direct and free access to such a service unreasonable? Surely not when your telephone is on a remote rural farm or when you are using a mobile phone. When is it unreasonable to provide a service to help save a life? Part (b) of subclause (2) states that the ACA must have regard to the objective that carriage services used for emergency calls should, as far as practicable, provide the emergency call person with automatic information about the location and identity of the caller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What on earth is meant by `have regard to' and `as far as practicable'? What is being said here? If something is technically too difficult, too expensive or too much trouble, can a commercial telecommunications provider forget about providing this information? I do not believe that some senators opposite realise just how important it is for this type of information to be provided directly to the emergency service providers. The increasing use of computer aided dispatch systems for emergency services means that this type of information can make the difference between locating a fire or a person in a critical medical condition and saving lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for instance, the case of a child dialling the emergency number or a distressed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1587"> or injured person dialling the number where neither the child nor the injured person is able to provide the location for the emergency. In such cases the computer aided dispatch systems will show emergency personnel on a computer screen the exact location&mdash;on an on screen map&mdash;of the telephone from which the call is being made. Failure to gain this information from the carriage provider could lead to the death of the injured person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this type of system also helps to eliminate hoax callers, as the location and telephone number of the telephone is immediately shown on the computer screen. Once again, a failure to provide all the information could mean that the emergency personnel are too busy following up on a hoax call to go to a genuine emergency, thereby creating a life&hyphen;threatening situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be as effective as possible, there is obviously a need to set a high standard of service for emergency calls. There are no clauses setting out the standard of either the delivery or the ongoing development of emergency call provisions. On top of all this, in a competitive environment there is no written requirement for the telecommunications providers to fund or finance the emergency call services. In other words, there is no guarantee in the legislation that emergency call services will have adequate funding to operate efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this hole in the legislation was pointed out to Senator Alston, obviously with no effect, by his state colleagues in Queensland, the National Party emergency services minister, Mr Mick Veivers, and the police minister, Mr Russell Cooper. I will quote from a letter that they wrote to Senator Alston on 12 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither my colleague nor myself can understand why, in life threatening and time critical circumstances, your Government chooses to be vague and non-committal given how successfully the present national system, developed largely voluntarily by a monopoly carrier, has operated, especially by comparison with other parts of the world. Any reference to funding these critical services is absent in the Bill, causing us to wonder about the motivations behind the design of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a competitive environment all commercial providers will understandably try to minimise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the cost of any of its operations, including emergency call service operations. The risks involved in not prescribing a funding regime in this particular case are too great to contemplate. It is shameful that an Australian government should make no provision to ensure that there is adequate funding for emergency call services. I will quote from the Queensland coalition ministers  again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitive commercial market forces are simply not going to produce safety critical systems where no revenue stream is allowed. Indeed the greatest concern will be the exposure that will begin to develop in rural and regional areas. That position simply cannot be accepted by the Queensland Government. The need for a uniform Emergency Call Service is clearly more critical than the provision of the standard telephone service, yet while the requirement for the latter is quite specific in the Bill, the full requirement for the former is not.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is obvious that the Queensland coalition, and therefore the Queensland government, is not at all happy with this legislation. In the minister's stubborn approach to the Queensland government he has ignored their very valid fears about emergency call numbers and a well&hyphen;funded emergency call service. Apart from this, and possibly even worse, is the potential for confusion about emergency numbers, which is embodied in the legislation. Clause 450&mdash;emergency service numbers&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The numbering plan may specify different numbers for use in different areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Imagine those people living near state or regional borders, holiday makers, those moving interstate or someone who is  simply travelling in an area away from home. What number do they call? The time taken to find out or decide whether to call 000, 112 or whatever other numbers might be used for emergency calls under this system could be long enough to cause the unnecessary death of someone in a critical condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely we can agree that there should be one emergency number across Australia. Surely it will be confusing enough, especially for young children, to unlearn the 000 number and learn to dial the new emergency number without being confused with different numbers for different areas. It is not uncommon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1588"> for ordinary people to forget their four&hyphen;digit pin numbers for various credit cards. Is this government going to put lives at risk by confusing telephone users, especially itinerant ones, with a plethora of emergency telephone numbers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland National Party Minister for Police and National Party Minister for Emergency Services understand the perils of this inadequate legislation. When is the federal minister going to realise and understand the problems that his legislation will cause and the lives that he might sacrifice as a result? The minister's state colleagues, in a joint letter about what they describe as a critical issue, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications Bill 1996 exposure draft was released in October 1996 with an impossibly tight program for consideration of submissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but we believe the timetable was such that none of the changes needed could have been incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I realise that there are some 800 pages of legislation involved here and that it is difficult to make such a large piece of legislation perfect, but please let us at least get the provision of emergency calls right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now to the consequences for rural and regional Australians. I represent Queensland, which is a diverse state, and many Queenslanders live in rural, regional and remote areas. I cannot emphasise enough the need for up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date telecommunications services to be provided to these areas. There are many farmers who use modern fax facilities, and there are School of the Air students who will increasingly want to use Internet services, e-mail and other developing technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard telephony service that is now in place will not be the standard of the future. The provision of modern, advanced telecommunications services to rural and regional Australians must be ensured. Because the provision of such modern services will be uneconomic to commercial telecommunications providers, the legislation must specify quite clearly that modern telecommunications 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services must be specified as part of the universal service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A failure to do this will mean that Australians who live outside the capital cities, and especially those who live outside other major centres, will become second&hyphen;class citizens. I am sure that the National Party senators in this chamber will also stand up for Australians living in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard telephone services referred to in the bill under universal service obligations must never be allowed to become old standard or substandard telephone services. The bill is not clear enough on this matter which is essential to the Australian way of life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address my comments in this second reading debate on the Telecommunications Bill in a more general way. Despite numerous inquiries and reports into the various telecommunications and information technologies that have surfaced over the last few years, neither the governments nor the carriers have provided a blueprint or industry development plan of where our telecommunications industry is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maintenance of society is properly addressed by coupling investment and information technology expenditure with social equity and access provisions. There exists an interdependent link between social policy and economic development, and governments have the ability to position the telecommunications industries within a framework of regional development and infrastructure. For instance, locating knowledge and information technology based industries together with transport, mining and construction creates a Silicon Valley style development that develops regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications industry is undergoing revolutionary transformations, and Australia is in a position to ride the crest of this wave provided we implement far-sighted and comprehensive policies. For too long parliament has had its attention diverted to other issues, specifically ownership, with this myopic view of telecommunications allowing central issues to be downgraded while public debates about who owns what are carried out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1589">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, governments should be prepared to provide sanctions to enforce carriers to commit themselves to decisive industry development plans, and the telecommunications industry must expand, but information technology will achieve this only if it is freed from languishing with some decrepit, old legislative structure within which carriers and new technology providers struggle. I am pleased to see that the government has indicated that they will be supporting Labor's amendment to include sanctions with respect to the implementation of industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On telecommunications generally, part of the role of government should be to be able to articulate a social policy objective which recognises the direction telecommunications infrastructure, telephony, facsimile services and other services like the Internet are taking. The coalition has, to some extent, abdicated its responsibilities by failing to outline a philosophy or cultural direction with respect to telecommunications. They are content to ape the US without regard to our unique culture and history, ignoring many unique features of our telecommunications industry, which include our geography, our spectrum availability and our unusually high uptake of new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A perception exists that the Australian telecommunications industry is subservient to overseas markets, and hence the communications community views the Internet and electronic commerce as generally a foreign domain, one in which Australia is not required to take a proactive legislative role. John Nieuwenhuizen, author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asleep at the Wheel: Australia on the Superhighway</EMPHASIS>, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 March that an inquiry into the proposed introduction of the Internet in schools is essential. Nieuwenhuizen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were royal commissions when radio and television were introduced. There ought to be public debate and inquiry [about the Internet] before it's too late.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nieuwenhuizen's point is that this government has failed to provide a blueprint or policy for the Internet and that when other communications technology such as television was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduced there was widespread debate and investigation, yet the Internet, which defies national borders and to some extent regional control, has not been brought into the wider telecommunications policy debate. I am not calling for another inquiry, but it is essential that major parties develop a comprehensive policy vision for the social implications and applications of telecommunications infrastructure, industry access and specifically content. Labor is moving down this path, and yet the government is stricken by an all too familiar inertia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to this issue, Labor, in one of its recommended amendments to these bills, talks about the importance of having some sort of body that can conduct the type of social research to which I am referring. Certainly the Consumer Telecommunications Network and the Communications Law Centre advocated that quite succinctly in their submissions to the inquiry into these bills. Labor has recognised the value and strategic importance of this type of work and hence has embodied that in one of its recommendations. That will go some way to making sure there is a facility and body in Australia to perform some of this work. Nonetheless, that does not remove the obligation on major parties, particularly the party in power, the government, to have some comprehensive vision for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a growing perception within some sections of the business and commercial sector that the Internet has failed to deliver. Of course, the Internet is not there for commercial transactions only. To many users it is about entertainment and surfing. In fact, the majority of Internet users use it for entertainment purposes. To others it offers the promise of information access and exchange for the benefit of the global community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sales tax is another issue. Others are piracy and copyright protection. What is freedom to some people&mdash;freedom to access materials, goods, knowledge and ideas&mdash;may be oppressive or fraudulent to others. Intellectual copyright and plagiarism are issues now confronting both high school and university students as well as the general public, whilst 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1590"> globalisation of trade and encryption requires some specific policy response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, it is the federal government which must find a balance between protecting the disparate public and private interests with regard to the Internet, and articulate a holistic approach to information services. Serious questions regarding the Internet must be addressed in this policy context, including where it is taking us, whether it is a tool that is essential in schools, and whether it is a service for industry or an entertainment and niche service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teachers and academics have already voiced their concerns about the effect of the Internet and other telecommunications on literacy and writing skills. A Tasmanian based group called Switch Off and Play, or SOAP, has voiced concerns about the long-term damage that computers and video games have on children. Gradual loss of creativity and originality in young people may well result from the unchecked use of such telecommunications and information technology. These issues go beyond just IT policy and well into the realms of education and social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shift towards what the Americans call `edutainment' is acceptable in Seattle schoolrooms. However, teaching our children via video games and cartoons may well prove to be culturally and educationally misguided. I believe it is reasonable to implement very succinct policies that will ensure these issues will not be subsumed by the commercial interests of IT providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, libraries are facing a dilemma caused by the massive availability of electronic information. The Internet, electronic commerce and basic access and equity to telecommunications services are obviously paramount, and in many respects this whole area is a major policy tool for governments. Information and access to information are now a determinant of power in the community, and governments have the ability to use telecommunications as a mechanism with which to introduce social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Untimed data calls is one area where public policy impacts upon social structures and environments. I am firmly in favour of untimed data calls in both the residential and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the business sector. That is all well and good, but when analysing that position it is important to understand that we cannot consider data calls in the old context. We have to consider how those calls will be used in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unclear what the government's position is with respect to data calls, specifically those for local businesses, despite the government having articulated quite a clear position in the inquiry report. Labor has made it patently clear what its position is: untimed voice and data calls for local business and residential customers must be maintained. Paragraph 2.80 of the inquiry report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee carefully considered the views put by Telstra and found some merit in its argument. The Committee does not believe that the Government should allow these guarantees to be exploited by some to the cost of consumers in general. However, the evidence put before the Committee did not persuade it that there was a widespread problem of exchange congestion or that, where such problems existed, they were leading to significant costs being passed on to other consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That comment was made in the majority report and was made in the context of the government arguing for the retention of untimed local data calls for business, certainly until they advocate a review in July 1998. Since that report has been published, the government's position has become very fuzzy indeed and I wait with interest for the minister's position with respect to these calls and exactly what the government intends to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is true to its views in the report and it in fact does not back away from a very important position, then we have to look at that in the context of where the current debate is with respect to Telstra, given that obviously Telstra will be impacted upon largely in the first instance. There is no doubt that in the current climate they are positioning themselves for privatisation and are attempting to ensure that they have at least some reasonable expectation of a profit generating market in business data calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to questions responded to in the recent additional estimates hearings, Telstra are aiming to have the technology installed to ensure that they will be able to provide a comparison to consumers, whether they be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1591"> business or residential, as to what their bill would be either under a timed call package or under the current untimed billing mechanisms. I will quote again from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> with respect to that. In response to a question from me as to what degree Telstra had conducted investigations to implement the appropriate technology for billing for timed calls and untimed calls, Mr Ward said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are certainly working on technology to provide the capacity to be able to identify local call usage in terms of time of day and usage. In terms of the cost of that technology, I do not have those numbers in my head but I can certainly provide them. The capacity is certainly not implemented at the moment, but we think this is important&mdash;not only in the longer term of providing options for pricing but also in terms of billing inquiries and helping customers understand their usage patterns, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The significance of this is highlighted for small business, whom the minister has described as having the capacity to pay. Under the government's position, the small business users of data calls will not have the opportunity in the first instance to compare such billing; they will be potentially straight onto a time based system without having the option of untimed local data calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With bills packaged in this way, while being perhaps competitive in the first instance, it sets the carriers up for complete control over the pricing of bandwidth along a vertically integrated pathway of data. Perhaps the minister should also have a look at the additional estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, in which Telstra appear to contradict the position they took in the bills inquiry. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just returning to my earlier questions with respect to billing and pricing policy, how do you intend to implement a timed data call for business in relation to Internet services provided by an Internet service provider other than Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After a comment by Mr Ward, Mr Hambleton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think we have a clear mechanism yet to implement time dating for data calls, whether for business or residential. In fact, in the process of representing to the Senate on the post-1997 legislation, we asked for a reserve power to address the issue if, in fact, there was a need to have a timed charge in the future and we specifically did not request any immediate intervention. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I sense a slight contradiction in there somewhere and believe that that statement by Mr Hambleton from Telstra really calls into question the minister's position quite generally with respect to the government's position, being ambiguous on timed local data calls for business quite specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More generally, 40 per cent of Australian homes use personal computers. It is not an unreasonable expectation that some time in the future a far greater percentage of those will be connected to the Internet. At the moment the protection of untimed local data calls is expected to be reviewed in 1998. I would like to be a voice for those residential users, too: down the track, timed data calls by residential users are a completely undesirable outcome, as they are currently with respect to business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate regarding the provision of untimed local data calls to business has particular relevance with respect to the Internet generally. Currently, Telstra charge for the volume of data that ISPs&mdash;Internet service providers&mdash;download. Then those ISPs on&hyphen;sell in a variety of ways, providing customers with a range of charging options. Telstra's position in the marketplace as a wholesaler of bandwidth to Internet service providers puts their pricing policy for Telstra Internet access under the spotlight, as Telstra also compete against the ISPs for market share for commercial access to the Internet. The spotlight is warranted not for the wholesaling of bandwidth but for their charging of the connection between the user and the independent ISP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main issue there that comes into play is that, when we are talking about competition, are we talking about competition for competition's sake or are we talking about this particular issue with respect to ISPs and the ability of this legislation to address what could potentially be a conflict under this particular legislative regime if in fact those ISPs do not have some sort of protection from Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `so what' in all of this is of course ensuring that independent ISPs can continue to provide affordable Internet access without being squeezed. It is their servers that provide 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1592"> the free content back into cyberspace and those ISPs are important because they ensure the content remains free on the Internet. It is becoming apparent that many of the larger corporations view content provision as being profitable in the future, and the control of access to the Internet will be the key to charging for content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent US election campaign, President Clinton announced a major initiative concerning the Internet in classrooms, the role of the Internet in people's homes and the strategy he would implement via a legislative mechanism similar to our own universal service obligation. I think there are valuable lessons to be learnt from that, both with respect to education and with respect to ensuring that content is of a high standard and not in the grip of a particular commercial interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another upcoming issue is spectrum allocation. This issue tests legislators, who sometimes grapple with the concept of anticipating where future technologies will emerge from. In other words, we have got to be able to anticipate those developments and not restrict or confine any legislation to specific technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has yet to outline its policy position in regard to the procurement of telecommunications technologies. This government has ignored, in the processes of this, local IT manufacturers continuing to purchase offshore. Although the modem market has been tariff free for over a decade, local manufacturers are still restricted by federal policies that favour imported products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental tenet of good and reasonable government is its ability to provide basic access and equity to telecommunications. While increasing numbers of Australian homes have become on&hyphen;line, many other families are still without video recorders. For those at the bottom end of the scale, wealth now determines access. The information divide between rich and poor, haves and have&hyphen;nots, has the potential to create a permanent underclass that will take no part in this revolution, as Paul Crawford has articulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental question is who pays for and who benefits from telecommunications? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Is it the users, be they private, business, government or other organisations? Is it the indirect beneficiaries or is it the community at large? Competition for competition's sake ignores the potential of our indigenous IT industry as much as it relies solely on consumer savings as a measure of its success. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats recognise the reality that competition policy will be applied to telecommunications in this country. This raft of bills before us today, as Senator Schacht has said, concludes the direction set by his government back in 1991. Both major parties subscribe to the competition policy and so we must accept that the matter in relation to telecommunications is all over bar the shouting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, two aspects of this debate which we feel bound to put on the public record and about which we know we will hear very little from the government or the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we said in 1991 that the benefits of competition had not been demonstrated. Six years later there is no more evidence that an industry with three major players is more efficient or benefits taxpayers or consumers more than one which is dominated by one player and that player, a publicly owned company. Senator Kernot said then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that competition will necessarily lead to increased productivity and changes in work practices. It is a fact peculiar to telecommunications that technology, as much as competition, is likely to result in lower prices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Through technology, the cost to deliver STD calls fell dramatically in the 1980s. Charges have not reduced at anything like the pace of the savings, in spite of competition. Of course, the new competitive regime prevented Telstra, at the Senate hearings into these bills, from revealing what the share of its revenue derived from this source is. The new cloak of secrecy, jargonistically referred to as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, which goes hand in hand with competition, is of major concern to the Democrats&mdash;not just for the obvious reasons of accountability but because it significantly reduces the scope for government to plan for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1593"> the future of telecommunications in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another fact peculiar to telecommunications is that the government, as owner of Telstra, has determined both the rate of return and the cost to consumers. These two factors will make it conveniently difficult to question the outcomes and challenge that blind faith of adherence to competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter which must be put on the record is the question of public ownership and responsibility. I ask the Senate to reflect for a moment on what it is actually doing as public custodian of Telstra&mdash;one of the largest profit making organisations in this country. I ask the Senate to imagine a board of directors acting as a driving force in reducing its company's market share and therefore the profits it returns to its shareholders. The aim of this legislation is very clearly to reduce Telstra's so&hyphen;called market dominance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past decade, governments have shaped Telstra into a corporation and a highly competitive organisation, encouraged it to eliminate thousands of jobs, to sell off sections of the organisation, such as Visionstream, and to wind back research and development and community service undertakings. Now the government will insist that Telstra gives up a substantial part of its custom in the name of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, when Telstra behaves like its competitors and fights to defend and expand that market, the major parties accuse it of anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour and regulate for so&hyphen;called competitive neutrality. When it complains about having to fund directory assistance, to provide untimed calls for data or to give support to advocacy groups&mdash;in other words, behaving like any free market operator&mdash;the government increasingly waivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no prizes for guessing who the likely competitors for telecommunications in this country will be. We know we can expect the multi&hyphen;billion dollar overseas telecommunications giants to dominate our market in Australia in the not too distant future. There will be more foreign ownership and more profits leaving this country&mdash;and from an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry which is perhaps the only one to enjoy a high rate of growth at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of the minister's desire that we should regard Telstra as, I think he put it, a 60&hyphen;pound gorilla, devouring and destroying its emerging small and medium sized competitors. I think the time has come for us to see Telstra as a medium sized player on a global market competing against foreign giants such as British Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three weeks ago, the government announced quietly that it had signed an agreement with another 67 nations that it would not in any way impede the entry of multinational telecommunications companies into this country. Senator Kernot said in 1991 that she believed that the government was so busy tilting the level playing field heavily in favour of the new foreign owned entrant into international telephone services against the incumbent Telecom that the paying public's contribution and shareholding was being ignored. She pointed out that each and every Australian had already made a fundamental investment in the telecommunications network to a tune of $3,500 for each household. Ordinary Australian have already paid to establish a network from which big business in particular is to gain an enormous profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot said that for perfectly sound economic reasons Telecom's new competitor is likely to be interested in only the profitable heavy trunkline traffic and the new mobile telephone network&mdash;and how right she was. As I said earlier, the Democrats have yet to be convinced that competition is any guarantee of efficiency, better services or lower costs. Competition in the roll&hyphen;out of TV cabling has seen carriers riding roughshod over community wishes, aerial cabling just for expediency, expensive duplication of infrastructure and, at the end of the day, deals which will no doubt result in reducing competition being done between carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also think the major shareholders of Telstra, the Australian people, are getting a raw deal with this legislation. Having said that, the Democrats acknowledge that there is little we can do to reverse this tide of major party support for competition policy. We will, however, remain vigilant and we will continue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1594"> to highlight the failures of competition as it applies to this important industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today and tomorrow I will be introducing a number of amendments. They will attempt to make the post&hyphen;July 1997 competitive regime fairer and they will strengthen the provisions in the legislation to protect rural, marginalised and residential consumers in particular. The Democrats want to see that the benefits of technology are shared much more equitably. We also want to see local government given the planning powers to act in the interests of their communities in relation to telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major parties have argued that the powers and immunities from state and local government regulations were given to carriers in the national interest. The Democrats fail to see how the national interest can be threatened by councils insisting that telecommunications cabling is installed underground where there is capacity to do so. We also fail to see why it is that the national interest is threatened by requiring carriers to site mobile phone towers away from schools and kindergartens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, we think the interest here is that of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications carriers were granted immunity from state and territory environment planning laws back in 1991 in the Telecommunications Act by the then Labor government with the support, of course, of the coalition. The Australian Democrats were the only party to raise vigorous objections at that time. I remind the Senate that the Democrats position on these powers and immunities has been consistent throughout. Senator Coulter, back in 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that no such power should be available. We believe that there should be the application of State laws to these bodies and we can point to numerous instances where, in the recent past, Telecom with its existing exemptions has engaged in activities that are contrary to State planning, zoning and environmental protection laws. This has caused very considerable disquiet in the local communities and there has been no legislative mechanism properly to correct or to supervise these activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since the immunities were introduced it has been understood that these powers and im 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munities would be removed from 1 July this year. But in this legislation they are to be extended a further three months and six months for cabling and towers respectively. Senator Alston has said on many occasions that these exemptions will be removed on 1 July and our amendments will hold the government to that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more worrying provisions of this legislation is the proposed ongoing exemption for so&hyphen;called low impact facilities. The Democrats see no reason to support any exemptions, particularly as these definitions have not been made public. We would vigorously oppose mobile phone towers and personal communications transmitters, for instance, being exempted from the normal planning requirements of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bulk of the Democrats amendments to this legislation will ensure that residential, rural and the more marginal consumers are provided with effective safeguards against the disbenefits of a concentration of services in high density sectors where competition will inevitably be the greatest. We are not convinced that voluntary codes of practice would give adequate consumer protection. I must say we are pleased to see that the government has taken up this issue in its amendments and to see that consumer organisations are represented in the development of these draft codes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also strongly support the establishment of a fund for communications social policy research. Other Democrats amendments will strengthen the universal service obligation. These will include the national relay service in the USO; maintaining free of charge operator assisted directory services and including them as part of the USO; insisting that the USO plans are lodged prior to awarding a tender to a provider; and ensuring that clear and public payphone siting guidelines are developed. The Democrats would have liked to put forward the Austel policy for payphone compliance but we note that this document is, in fact, confidential and I will be asking the minister to expand on why it is that this is not available as a public document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most striking inadequacies, I think, in this legislation is the provision of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1595"> telecommunications services to people in rural areas. There are a substantial number of households which do not presently receive the benefits of untimed local calls. There are those who are part of, but just outside, the designated call zone of regional and metropolitan centres and the rural sector, generally, has already suffered from the disproportionate investment in new infrastructure in our cities. In its haste to erect TV cabling and mobile phone towers in metropolitan areas Telstra has, for instance, neglected urgently needed upgrading of technology in country exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments will also bind Telstra, as part of the USO, to targets for extending access to digital data capability by the year 2000 for that last 6.6 per cent of customers in Australia. The legislation before us would allow carriers to offer lower charges for local calls in some geographic areas or for some customer groups or individuals but not others. In our view, this goes against any notions of equity and fair play. Our amendments will prohibit price discrimination across call zones on all carriers. Another casualty of competition policy has been coverage of rural Australia by an adequate mobile phone network. The phase&hyphen;out of the analogue mobile phone network in advance of complete coverage by the digital system will be a major setback for rural users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments will require a review of the phase&hyphen;out of the analogue system and a guarantee that analogue will continue to be available until such time as the interference experienced by those users of hearing aids and other equipment is eliminated. This legislation will provide the minister with discretion to exempt carriers from any requirement to prepare industry development plans. Our amendments will make industry development plans a precondition for obtaining a carrier licence and will put in place the necessary enforcement mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our view that the industry development plans as currently outlined quite needlessly limit their effectiveness as a tool of industry policy and weaken the government's ability to extract desired outcomes for industrial development. Carriers are only required to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have an industry development plan in force within 90 days of being granted their licence. We think it is far more appropriate that approval of industry plans by the industry minister be made a prerequisite for obtaining a licence. This would guarantee that the government had more leverage and that industry development plans were not simply bureaucratic procedures which had no relevance in themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have indicated some of the amendments to be put by the Democrats, but I wish to take the opportunity to say how very difficult it has been for us to frame up the amendments in the impossibly short time frame that has been available. The government's own amendments have been available to us only in the last two days and even so were in draft form. The ALP amendments have still not been seen by us in their entirety. I want to refer to a motion put by Senator Alston in 1991 when similarly complex telecommunications legislation was before the Senate. His motion condemned the government's failure to allow reasonable time for consideration of the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consideration of these very important and complex bills has been squeezed into a very short time period. We have already expressed concern at the insistence of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee that submissions to its inquiry should be in the form of amendments to bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, we now have the opposition agreeing with the government to bring on these bills when the government's own amendments&mdash;some 300 pages&mdash;were received only a matter of hours ago and we still do not have all of the opposition's amendments. The Democrats believe that this is very unreasonable. This legislation is very important. It is impossible for us to properly deal with the legislation in this time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the opposition will mention the industrial relations agreement that was reached between the Democrats and the government late last year. I remind the opposition that, under those circumstances, two full days were given for the scrutiny of those IR bills and agreements. This, as I understand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1596"> it, is not planned to be afforded to the Democrats today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a feeling of deja vu about this debate because a number of the issues canvassed were canvassed in the Telstra sale bill. It is a pity that some of those issues were not taken cognisance of. Today I want to address my concerns about the impact of the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and cognate bills on rural and regional Australia. The Telecommunications Bill is a very large bill. A lot of reviewing has gone into it, and it entirely replaces the legislation which currently regulates the telecommunications industry. I think it grossly discriminates against the residents of rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most discriminatory parts of the bill are found in part 7. Part 7 purports to ensure that all people in Australia, wherever they reside or carry on business, will have access on an equitable basis to standard telephone services, pay phones and other prescribed carriage services. Its main defects relate to the specification of the universal service obligation. Clause 144 is the key provision of part 7 because it defines the universal service obligation. The clause is problematic because of the definition of the standard telephone service&mdash;that is, the bedrock service which must be provided to all people under the universal service obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the explanatory memorandum notes, part 7 of the proposed act is based on part 13 of the 1991 act. The explanatory memorandum asserts that the current act has been effective in delivering universal service to date. It is true that under public ownership Telstra provided a national service that was high by world standards. Telephone penetration is in excess of 96 per cent of Australian households compared with 94 per cent in the USA and 90 per cent in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumers generally enjoy direct, uninterrupted access to the national network. However, in basing part 7 on part 13 of the current act, the government has seriously erred. It has failed to take into account in the last six years the rapid convergence of technologies currently taking place and the increasing demand for services such as rapid fax trans 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> missions, e-mail, the Internet, electronic commerce and educational applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old voice telephony service is no longer good enough  for the majority of Australians. This error, if allowed to go uncorrected, has potentially disastrous consequences for regional Australia in particular. This is because the provision of advanced telecommunications services to much of rural and remote Australia is uneconomic. Unless such services are specified as part of the universal service obligation, no carrier will provide them in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government attempts to explain its failure to properly address the issue by saying in the explanatory memorandum that, due to the important regulatory role played by the standard telephone service, its definition can be adjusted by prescribing other purposes and by precisely specifying performance characteristics. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ability to prescribe additional purposes for the standard telephone service provides an effective functionality&hyphen;based means of clarifying or upgrading the standard telephone service over time.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is good public service jargon. In other words, residential consumers in rural areas will be stuck with the plain old handset, together with the government's assurance that it will clarify or upgrade the standard telephone service by regulation under the act and over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought the appropriate time for this clarification, for this to be spelt out clearly, would be now whilst this act over considerable time undergoes one of the most significant rewrites ever. It does not occur to the government to do that. No, it wants to keep us out there in the bush in the horse and buggy era, while allowing those in the city areas to have all sorts of mod cons that we can only dream about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, this is not good enough. I have no reason to believe that the government, in fact, will upgrade the definition of the standard telephone service. Why would it? People who already are getting into the industry will not be in any great hurry to see themselves having to pay more in connection with the universal service obligation or to see increases 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1597"> in services included under it, because they will cost them more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech on the Telstra sale bill, I spoke about the standard telephone service review group that had been set up by Minister Alston in July. I questioned then, and I question now, why the Telstra sale bill was not held over until this information and report had become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Minister Alston announced the review, he lauded it. He said that it was being undertaken by a very good group of people; they were a very broad representation of a very wide cross-section of the industry and the consumers. It did have representatives of Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, ATUG&mdash;the Australian Telecommunications Users Group&mdash;National Farmers Federation and consumer groups. There were 10 people on that committee which put out a report on 5 or 6 February&mdash;an interesting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine of the 10 committee members put out a majority report comprising 178 pages of well argued information and recommendations. There also was a six-page minority report from Professor Ergas. Guess which of those two reports the minister decided to talk about and praise in response? It was the six-six page minority report of Professor Ergas. It was not the majority report of the representatives of all the industry, consumer and telecommunications users groups and the National Farmers Federation. I wonder why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that one of the reasons is&mdash;and it is pretty obvious now with this legislation&mdash;that the nine&hyphen;member majority report recommended `a cautious upgrade of the telephone service to digital data capability by the year 2000'. That would mean that everybody in Australia by the year 2000 would have access to digital data capability, fast faxes, e&hyphen;mail and Internet at a reasonable standard and reasonable speed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election we had this now government, the then opposition, running around saying, `Everybody in Australia will be on ISDN by the middle of this year.' Whoops, it forgot about the six per cent who are remote. By the middle of this year 94 per cent of Australians will have ISDN access, and that is good. But what about the six-per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent? That six per cent is scattered across most of the states and one of the territories in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to these services by children who are undertaking distance education would be of great assistance to them. These children would benefit greatly from good access to the Internet, good e-mail and good fax stream access. They would improve and enhance their educational standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had, and still have, a policy of the year 2000, because we see that as realistic. It is interesting when you read the press comments of the time. An article by Anne Davies published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 7 February entitled `Rural phone reform less likely' picked up some comments from Allan Horsley who was the chair of the committee. He said of Senator Alston's press release that it was `almost an insult to the committee' and that it was `grossly inappropriate that the work be given the offhand treatment it has, especially as the committee included the carriers'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an interesting article by Steve Lewis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 7 February entitled `Alston stirs up static over digital access costs query'. Again, there Allan Horsley's comments are noted that the minister risked losing the `confidence of the industry if he ignored a substantial body of work undertaken over a reasonable period of time'. Graham Lynch, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 February entitled `Alston weighs up cost of national ISDN standard', again quotes Allan Horsley that `the work and opinion of a reasonable bunch of people has been set aside by one distant professor. He has an academic ultra&hyphen;dry view, which has as much relevance as cows jumping over the moon'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are scathing media comments which were made at the time the minister was making known his support for the minority report. It is interesting because, as I have stated, Mr Horsley was the chair of Senator Alston's expert working group, established in mid-1996 to assist in the formulation of policy to guide the drafting of the post-July 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1598"> 1997 legislation. Julie Austin of the National Farmers Federation has also strongly criticised the minority report. So you can see that there is a great deal of concern being expressed by people who know about, and have an interest in, this issue. The minister's reaction to this and what will happen to standard services, standard definitions and access to the data is of grave concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that is of grave concern to people in the bush is what might be done to local call rates. There has been talk of encouraging competition between the various capital cities, that there will be an average and that the country people will get the average. That is not fair. That is not the equal playing field under which competition can exist. You will be putting a greater impost on country industries and businesses to compete against their city counterparts when, in fact, they will be financially disadvantaged. You will have the situation that, bordering on Sydney, people who are only just outside of the metropolitan area with their businesses will be having to pay maybe two or three cents per local call more than somebody who virtually might be across the road if they are in the Sydney area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the sort of thing that the government, through the introduction of this bill, will let happen. I urge people to support the opposition's amendments in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This message concerning Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is being dealt with in rather a hasty manner given the circumstances that have arisen. I trust that the chamber understands the manner in which we enter this debate. It is a most extraordinary way of doing business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is one which the opposition welcomes in that the government has come to accept the Senate's original amendments&mdash;amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 that were proposed by the government in the Senate&mdash;which flowed from a welcome and constructive relationship that has developed notwithstanding the differences that still exist between the opposition and the government on these matters. When these measures were first brought before the parliament, the opposition expressed the view that a number of them were harsh and unjustifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wrongly claimed it needed these measures in order to deliver the program it had announced for 1996-97. The fact is that Labor in government delivered programs of a similar size in successive years without resorting to such harsh measures. The opposition was very concerned that a gulf had opened up in the public sphere of debate on immigration matters. In discussions with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), the shadow minister Mr Kerr made it clear that common ground 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could be reached and, in so far as it was possible, the opposition would enable that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister took up some of these matters and, as a result, undertook not to proceed with increasing the English education charges at least for this budgetary period. We thank him for that. However, we do not know what the government's intention is with respect to the next budget round, and we have some apprehension on that score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We hold the view that it is wrong in principle to increase the English language charges. At the last election the coalition said that they were operating on the basis that `a common language is the glue of a cohesive nation'. It seems hypercritical to us that, in the first budget that this government brought down, they increased the cost of English education for migrants by some 200 per cent which therefore restricted access to such tuition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament expresses the correct precedence that it gives to the importance of the English language and, through this mechanism, the parliament will give proper priority to ensure that new arrivals in this country are able to access tuition at a cost which is not excessive. In recognition of this fact the minister has deleted the English education charges from the increases being pursued by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area in which the minister has indicated there is some capability of modification has been the issue of de facto and interdependent applications and a prior cohabitation period. There has been some suggestion that the opposition has taken the view that it would be inappropriate for the government to insist on verification of the substance of de facto and interdependent relationships before they enter this country. That was never the case when we were in government, and in opposition we have supported the government on a number of matters which further tightens screening procedures, including the introduction of a two&hyphen;year probationary visa for off-shore applicants whether they were married, de facto or interdependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this bill, we stood ready to assist the minister on all reasonable measures to ensure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1603"> that any necessary tightening could be dealt with. We did so, however, on the basis that we had a genuine concern about the application of a scheme that would have required a two-year prior cohabitation period outside of Australia for applicants to establish legitimacy of a de facto or interdependent relationship. Many people who have travelled overseas and established a relationship which they regard as akin to a marriage&hyphen;like relationship would have found it impossible to access this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, what would have flowed from this is an increase in the so-called sham marriages. In other words, people who had put themselves forward as couples in a genuine relationship but who, for various reasons, chose not to consummate the relationship by formal marriage would have been compelled to go through a marriage ceremony they did not desire to have. More importantly though, this would not have been available to interdependent couples. The interdependency class, which is certainly not required as a matter of law, is utilised by people who form same sex relationships. Of course, such persons are not in a position to formalise their relationship by a marriage&hyphen;like ceremony. The result is that it would have opened up an area of discrimination in public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has undertaken that, in exercising his power to create regulations under these provisions, the period will be set at no longer than 12 months. The minister has recognised that this may still create some particular instances of hardship; so a discretion will reside with the minister enabling him to waive the requirement in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will now move to the issue of capping. We note that the government has also accepted amendment No. 3 but has done so with some reluctance. The government has moved in the House a further amendment enabling us to cap and queue the aged parent category. The issue at stake is the principle that was established in legislation, which was proposed by the now minister when he was an opposition spokesman and agreed to by the then government, that we would exempt direct family members&mdash;that is, husbands and wives, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dependent children and aged parents&mdash;from arrangements relating to the power of the government to determine or to cap the number of family members who could enter the country under this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even then there was a distinction between, on the one hand, husbands and wives and dependent children and, on the other, aged parents. Inherent in the arrangement was that people did not have an absolute right to bring their aged parents here because of the balance of family test. The test means that for people to be eligible to come, they had to have at least half their children in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this bill came before the Senate the shadow minister had reached an agreed position with the minister that we were prepared to propose an amendment giving effect to enable the government to cap and queue the aged parent category, but the government insisted on taking the vote to the brink and testing the numbers in the Senate for the power to cap all categories. The minister recognised in opposition that it was no task of government to deal with those matters. In fact, he said that it would be unconscionable for the government to do such a thing and it would cause agony. The government has been spared this agony by its welcome concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the opposition will support the amendments, given that it was an amendment that we were prepared to move. I believe that we can say that there has been some cooperation, which has produced a fruitful and commonsense approach on this matter. We firmly say, however, that no government should restrict the most fundamental of all human rights&mdash;that is, the right of persons to choose to marry and start a family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note for the record&mdash;once again, I reiterate on behalf of the Australian Democrats&mdash;our concerns with the original schedule 3 of this bill in relation to the seeking of an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for migration regulations. I am aware that the act proposed such an exemption in relation to the making of certain regulations which would discriminate between de facto and married couples. Indeed, some changes have been made. During the last debate on this bill the mandatory cohabitation period was reduced from two years to one year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me deal with the capping and queuing argument. That was a matter that the government included in Migration Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1996, No. 211. On that occasion I vigorously opposed and voted against that regulation. The regulation was defeated. In the same way, when the government introduced the matter by way of a provision in legislation, I also voted against that section of that particular bill. It should be noted that that particular provision relating to capping and queuing for spouses and for persons in that relationship was defeated by two votes in this chamber, one of which was yours, Mr Chairman. The other one was mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the government has responded to this quite definite view of the Senate and has now agreed not to cap and queue persons in the relationship, which has been described as a fundamental right. I am not so sure that, as was suggested earlier in this debate, the right to form and found a family is the most fundamental of all rights. I would have thought it was the right to life, the right to liberty and the right to security of person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, there was another comment made during the debate just concluded which said that it was unfair to deal harshly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with those who consummated the relationship by a formal marriage. I thought it was the other way around&mdash;that you actually consummate the marriage rather than having the marriage consummate the relationship. That is a debating point, I suppose. It may be a reflection of how far we have gone down the track. I could not let that go with making a reference to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on the matter I made it perfectly clear that the problem with the government's previous approach is that you have a very important principle. It relates to the bond of marriage and the family being the foundation of any civilised society. Perhaps that is what a previous speaker meant when he talked about the most important right. Yes, it is if you are talking about societal rights in the sense that marriage and the family are the foundation of any civilised society. I do not propose to go over the areas that I canvassed on the previous occasion, nor do I intend to go over the areas that I canvassed when talking at length on Migration Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1996, No. 211.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very heartening to see that the government has accepted the overwhelming view that was stated on 3 March 1997 by the Senate in respect of capping and queuing of spouses. I am not entirely happy, frankly, with its amendments that are now before us relating to the parents of Australian residents. I really feel that this country should have a far more compassionate immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had arguments with the opposition when they were in government about this question. I believe in immigration, particularly as we as a country have at this time reached the stage when our birthrate is below replacement level. We are going to have great demographic problems in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say that opposition to capping and queuing parents is going to exacerbate that problem. I do not think it will. I believe that migration to Australia needs community support. What better community support is there than for residents of Australia with parents overseas being able, if those parents so wish, to have those parents come and stay with them? I think that that would give a boost to the popularity of the program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is in the chamber, and I say that one of the fundamental human rights is the right to be educated by the state and to ensure that appropriate resources are provided.

We have been through a number of items on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  and, as I did explain earlier, ministers&mdash;and shadow ministers, I might say, Senator Faulkner&mdash;have made other plans in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1606"> relation to a number of pieces of legislation that could be debated. The government's view was that an appropriate use of the time this evening would be to allow speakers who are ready to speak&mdash;a number of speakers who put their name on the euthanasia bill speakers list are available to do this&mdash;to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own view is that the time allocated for that debate and the number of speakers who have indicated they will contribute to this debate mean that, if we had this extra couple of hours available to do that, it would take a lot of pressure off the Senate and off those who have decided to contribute to that debate. As it is, an enormous number of senators&mdash;virtually all&mdash;are seeking to make contributions. I have looked at the speakers list and spent quite a lot of time today looking at how we could manage this, and indeed at the government senators party room meeting tonight suggested that, if we do want to see this matter dealt with, then senators would have to be careful with their use of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two hours and 10 minutes remaining until 11 o'clock this evening would have allowed a lot of that pressure to be removed. A number of coalition senators and, as I understand it, a number of opposition senators have said privately that they would be prepared to debate that. It would have been a good way to relieve some pressure. It would have allowed a better airing of the matters in relation to that important piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we must respect that the Senate brings together people with a variety of views and that maybe not all senators share that view. If there is consensus on the matter, I would be happy to move that that bill come on. For the record others may seek to explain why that cannot happen. The government will move in that way unless there is a genuine consensus amongst all present.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) for his forbearance in the matter. The government is taking the wise course here. The euthanasia legislation is very particular in that it is a matter of conscience. It is not a piece of government legislation. People feel very strong personal involvement with it. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular, Northern Territorians are quite concerned and interested in it&mdash;so much so, as I understand it, that there is a special facility for the territory to listen to that debate, and that facility will be available tomorrow night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate would, I think, create unnecessary potential angst in the Northern Territory, which above all is affected by the Euthanasia Laws Bill, if we were to bolt into that debate and hold the important primary stages of that debate before they expected it, before they were prepared to listen to it and indeed before they were able to listen to it at all. We have to, I think, recognise that is the wrong way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, this is also a matter for those senators who have not yet made up their mind on euthanasia. There are a number of them if we are to believe&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think any matter is as personally important to people as this one. I do not think we should be jumping the gun on an arrangement made weeks ago that it be debated tomorrow night, the night after and on Thursday night of this week. Some of us believe debating it then is even too early, but the debate has been set for then. It would be quite wrong for the Senate to, at night, jump the gun and get that debate under way before the Australian public, which is expecting it tomorrow, was aware of it, before the Northern Territory public in particular was able to even hear it and before those members of the Senate who want to give that debate its maximum consideration are prepared for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and I think this is even more compelling, there is a big list of government legislation which ought to be available for us to debate&mdash;for example, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. That bill's second reading has been heard in this chamber. It is

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make what I also consider to be very important statements on this particular piece of private member's legislation which has the effect of overriding legislation of the Northern Territory parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators will recall that, earlier this year, 450 territorians attended a public forum on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, convened by Senator Bob Collins and me in Darwin on the evening prior to the public hearings of the Senate special committee that was investigating this matter. It was quite apparent to any of us who attended that meeting in Darwin that for 450 people to attend a public forum and for 51 of them to speak at that public forum there was a great deal of community interest in this particular matter. The matter has been before the Northern Territory parliament and has been circulating in the Northern Territory community now for some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore with a great deal of anticipation and expectation that territorians are keen to listen to the full debate that is to proceed in this parliament this week. Whilst I appreci 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1609"> ate that Senator Harradine has pointed out that we are currently broadcasting&mdash;and being broadcast on the air&mdash;I would like to point out that, by arrangement with the ABC and the Parliamentary News Network, a historic arrangement has been struck. For the first time in the Northern Territory, the debates of this parliament are to be broadcast from 7.20 tomorrow night and on the subsequent two evenings of this debate. Whilst, like Senator McKiernan, I will not oppose any motion to proceed with debate tonight, the fact that it will be brought forward is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make is that, last Saturday evening in Darwin, I attended a historic celebration of the 50th anniversary of the commencement of ABC broadcasting in the Northern Territory and, likewise, I believe that tomorrow night's event was to be historic. I know that the mechanics of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are in Darwin at this very moment working on the final arrangements to enable the broadcasting to proceed and to cover the next three nights of deliberation and debate in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I counsel any of my Senate colleagues who wish to speak tonight, who may well have wanted those territorians to hear the contributions they make to any side or any perspective of this important debate, to be mindful of the fact that, as of tomorrow night, I can assure them that at least those 450 people who attended the public forum, if not many more, would want to hear and participate in the special arrangements that I appreciate that Madam President, Mr Speaker, the broadcasting committee of this parliament and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation have set in place to enable the proper and appropriate coverage of this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, like Senator McKiernan, I will not oppose any motion tonight, but I certainly ask senators to be mindful of the last minute precedents that are being created and changes that are being made because of the other arrangements to the legislative program for the night, and which we have only become aware of in the last half hour.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to briefly indicate that the reason we are debating this motion is that government business before us was concluded at 8.40 p.m., so there is no further government business. I think we all take account of the fact that the Senate is sitting today on a public holiday. We have made a range of special arrangements to enable the Senate to deal with the euthanasia bill. It includes a number of late night sittings which a number of senators obviously are prepared for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this circumstance&mdash;I think a very unusual circumstance, with a special day's sitting on a public holiday and where the Senate effectively has run out of government business&mdash;it is now an issue for the Senate, up till the hour of 11 o'clock tonight, to determine whether it believes it is appropriate for this bill to come forward for debate. That is an issue, as far as Australian Labor Party senators are concerned, that they will determine as they see fit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to these proceedings basically since the suspension of standing orders, which was somewhere between half past eight and a quarter to nine, and we have been debating ever since whether we are going to have a debate or not. It is probably proper to bring that to a close. I want to briefly indicate my position on this issue. Both sides I think very responsibly have taken a position of allowing a free vote on procedure. That also happened in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again find myself on exactly the same footing as my colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling made the point quite properly about the extraordinary procedures being taken care of at the moment in the Northern Territory. The way in which the territory tends to be forgotten and left out in these matters is interesting. I was interested in Senator Harradine's contribution, which I know was made in the best of faith, that people in the territory who wanted to listen would be listening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have either the benefit or the detriment, depending on which way you look at it, of parliamentary broadcasting in the Northern Territory. As an Australian first and a territorian second&mdash;but a close second&mdash;I have always regretted that subtle exclusion of those of us in the Northern Territory who have an interest in federal affairs and who would like to listen to parliamentary debates. This episode tonight simply puts the spotlight on the fact that we do not have this facility in the Northern Territory. I would like to thank both the President and the Speaker for the efforts that they have made. This legislation does, in effect, only impact&mdash;and impact severely, depending on which side of the debate you are&mdash;the law making powers in the parliament of the Northern Territory in which I served for 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw some attention to just how extraordinary this private member's bill is that we are dealing with. People keep talking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about it as a private member's bill. I am sure over the last few months that, when the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) and a number of his frontbench colleagues, along with opposition and independent members, were scratching their collective heads trying to fit in a long debate, they wished the same priority being attached to this private member's bill could be attached to government legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make that statement is that a number of ministers&mdash;not in respect of the Euthanasia Laws Bill&mdash;have publicly grizzled and complained, as we all did when in government, about the fact that they have been trying might and main to get their own legislation on the debating calendar and have failed. As Senator Abetz pointed out to this chamber, a number of people have gone on the public record saying that their primary objective in this debate is to delay the bill, to string it out so that there will not be a vote and to put it off as far into the future as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite my views on euthanasia being different from those of Senator Tambling, we are ad idem on the question of the bill itself. I do not think it is in anyone's interests, and certainly not that of territorians, whichever side of the debate you are on, to delay this unnecessarily any longer. There is no argument that there is a hiatus in here tonight. I do not think there will be an argument over the responsibility for that. The fact is that there is a hiatus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make that point&mdash;and I make it with some feeling&mdash;is that of the loneliness of the long distance politician. I have flogged down here gladly in the sense that I am a member of this parliament and I have a very good attendance record in the 10 years that I have been here. In fact, I am proud to say that when in government I had an impeccable record in the ministry for attending this parliament. However, it is a long way to come for a half&hyphen;day debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out the extraordinary measures that have been taken to get this private member's bill through. We have called the Senate back here today to make time for the euthanasia legislation. We have brought the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1612"> Senate back in here with those officers that are obliged to serve the chambers, not the parliamentary committees. I spent an unproductive morning wanting to finish off the drafting of two Senate reports that I have an interest in. I was not able to effectively do that because the staff of the committees are not here, and neither should they be. The expense of bringing them in would have been horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that some quite extraordinary provisions have been taken and some extraordinary expense has been gone to in expediting this so-called private member's bill. I do not think people should be getting too hung up on that at all. I must join with Senator Tambling in protesting this, but I will not be opposing the vote for the debate to go on tonight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this motion. As I said earlier, it is quite wrong because of a hiatus in government business&mdash;although more than 50 pieces of legislation are slated to be debated in the Senate&mdash;to bring on the Euthanasia Laws Bill, the debate of which territorians are waiting to listen to tomorrow night. As Senator Collins has just said, Senator Harradine was wrong in saying that they can listen to it tonight. They cannot because this debate is not being beamed to the territory. A very special effort has been made to ensure that territorians could listen to this piece of legislation when debated by the Senate tomorrow, the next night and the night after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite wrong and it is patronising to the people of the territory for Senator Abetz to get up and say, `Well, they can read it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.' It is totally patronising to the people in the territory who want to see their euthanasia laws protected and who are vitally concerned about the debate. If those people in the corridors saying that the Andrews bill will get through are correct, surely the territorians have the right to listen to the reasons for that event occurring in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the cause of this hiatus tonight: the government has not been able to get one piece of legislation, out of 50, ready to be debated here. I reiterate: the Telstra bill connected with money for the environment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was being debated here a fortnight ago. It was taken off because the government would be debating or negotiating the matter with the Democrats. The fortnight has now passed, so why can't it be brought back on? I suggest that it cannot be brought back on because the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) is not here. And, because he is not here, the Euthanasia Laws Bill will be shoved on and accelerated forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me categorically reject the suggestion, which I have heard a couple of times from those opposite, that I will do anything to delay the Euthanasia Laws Bill. It will be debated in the next few nights. I will not stop that. I will take my part and my constituency seriously in having input to that debate. But, like Senator Collins, I am aware also that there is an inordinate rush to bring on this mightily important piece of conscience legislation to get it through this place as fast as possible&mdash;and override the Northern Territory laws as far as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight that rush is becoming unseemly and reprehensible. The people of the territory deserve to be given more consideration by the Senate. I submit that the people of this country deserve to be given a better go by the Senate. I think it is quite wrong that, because the government is so inept as to not have one of those 50 pieces of legislation ready for debate, it now wants to break an agreement, a general arrangement which was agreed to by all parties in this place, and rush on this euthanasia legislation in a time slot where the start of this very important debate cannot be heard by Northern Territorians. It is very wrong, it is totally inconsiderate and, if allowed to happen, it will leave a pretty black mark against the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a conscience vote on this matter. However, I appeal to members of the Senate: in voting on this motion, consider those people who are not being heard and who cannot hear what is going on here tonight&mdash;and they are the people of the Northern Territory, who above all ought to be given our consideration and ought be able to hear the debate about a matter which is so important to them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fine. But I want to put some facts on the record about the dealings with the telecommunications bill. There has been extraordinary cooperation between all parties and the government over the process of dealing with the telecommunications bill. Going right back to when the bill was introduced, the opposition made an immediate offer to refer it straight to the legislative committee of ERCA in the Senate, on which the government has a majority, to deal with any disputes about amendments&mdash;and I outlined that in my second reading speech today&mdash;and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations that came through from the Senate committee were, in detail, overwhelmingly supported by all sides on that committee. There are a number of areas where there are amendments where we and the Democrats would oppose the government's position. But one should point out that the government&mdash;and I do not blame it for this&mdash;only last Friday circulated 93 pages of amendments which had to be added to the telecommunications bill; and that those amendments overwhelmingly were in response to the unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee, most of which, I have to say on behalf of the opposition, we will vote for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not get hold of those amendments until late Friday night. Over the weekend it is difficult to examine their drafting if they make changes to any of your own amendments. Certainly the Democrats had long indicated that they had many more amendments than the opposition to put forward on a range of issues. They have said, `We can't draft our amendments until we see the government's amendments,' which they were dealing with today. What happened tonight is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1614"> that, as they were trying do that, a 400&hyphen; or 500&hyphen;page bill came in here to be debated without a decent running sheet detailing all the amendments&mdash;and that just should not be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not blame the Democrats and I do not blame the government; it was just the logistics of what has come up. I am a little surprised that when it was accepted that the telecommunications package be adjourned until tomorrow the government was not able to find some other government measure to come back&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I have moved this because of the unseemly haste with which I believe some members of the Senate at least are trying to push forward the debate on the bill itself. I have no objection to the Euthanasia Laws Bill being debated and it will be debated this week and in the coming week but, as I said earlier, the territorians above all have an interest in this piece of legislation. I believe very deeply and implicitly that every means possible should be afforded to the people of the Northern Territory to take part in this debate by at least hearing it and being able to respond to it over the coming days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predicating that belief is my support for the territory to be self&hyphen;determining in the matter of voluntary euthanasia. It goes without saying that there was great deliberation in the territory. There was a preponderance of support in the territory and there was three times a vote in the territory for their voluntary euthanasia measure, their pioneering measure which has broken through as far as the inexorable move to voluntary euthanasia right around this world is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That legislation I put in the same camp as the pioneering legislation in New Zealand and South Australia 100 years ago which gave women the vote, and legislation earlier than that which gave children the right to education, and earlier still the legislation which freed people from slavery in certain parts of this planet. This is a part of the civilising progress of our world community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite may disagree with that but who could agree with them in trying to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to make my major contribution to this debate when the second reading of the bill comes on in due course.

It is a matter for all Australians to have that right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter for the whole of this country that individuals in their dying process have access to voluntary euthanasia if they so choose. It is a matter of individual rights for every person in this country. We have to pay tribute to the Northern Territory for the fact that it has expressed that right for the people of the least populous of all the states and territories on mainland Australia. What my motion explicitly calls on the Senate to recognise is that that right which the Territorians have taken for themselves ought to be a right for everybody, for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point the Senate to the persistent opinion polls which, since the 1950s, without failure, have shown that the majority of Australians wish for themselves the right to access voluntary euthanasia should they find themselves terminally ill, suffering, in pain and in undignified circumstances, and should they decide, along with their loved ones and their medical attendants, that enough is enough, that they cannot return to a full productive life, that they are terminally ill and that they want to end their suffering peacefully with their loved ones around them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the suspension of standing orders. The reason I support the suspension is that notice of this motion was given some time ago. People would have been aware that, at whatever time the debate on euthanasia started&mdash;whether it was today, tomorrow night, next week or next month&mdash;this suspension would take place. It was quite clear that it was going to take place and that it was important for some people to feel that the debate would not simply be a negative debate about whether or not we support overruling legislation in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am prepared to support the suspension and to listen to those senators who wish to actually make statements at the beginning of this debate as to what they believe in relation to voluntary euthanasia. As I mentioned when the motion to refer the Andrews' bill to a committee was mooted, I did think it was unfortunate that it went to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;it is not that I do not think they are a reasonable committee; it is just that I thought it would limit the range of issues that were looked at. I always felt that the widest consideration of this bill ought to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe this is one way of summarising some of those issues that have come up so far; maybe this is one way in which some of those debates that have been around in the community on the issue and that various senators have been approached with&mdash;on this issue rather than on the Andrews' bill&mdash;will get an airing before the rest of the debate

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to indicate how I will be voting on this, as I did last time. I will be voting against the suspension of standing orders. I joined Senator Tambling in not opposing the other suspension of standing orders so the debate proper could be brought on. I think it was Senator Murphy from our side who said he was not an expert in euthanasia; neither am I, but I certainly recognise a piece of gazumping headline hunting when I see it. That is what this is. It is also a piece of shameless time wasting and interference. What I predict, and I think I am fairly safe in this prediction, is that before the debate is finished we are going to see a lot more of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I make those points&mdash;as I said before, and I just want to say it again&mdash;is that it does not matter what side of the argument you are on, I do not think it is in anyone's interests to string this debate out longer than is necessary. I think that is the view, frankly, of the majority of senators in this place irrespective of their position on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to make my views clear on this particular issue. Whilst I am sympathetic to some of the tenets of the substantive motion that Senator Brown seeks to have debated, I am not in support of the suspension of standing orders because the very reason the major debate was to take place tonight was a matter of procedure. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has very properly reported and we as a Senate chose not to discuss that report at the time of its tabling in order to have that debate take place cognately

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To now seek to gazump that debate in this manner is moving out of the agreed set of processes that have flowed through very properly from the participation of many thousands of people around Australia in the Senate committee considerations.

Much as I am opposed to that particular legislation and I will make that very patently clear in the second reading debate, I do not think we need&mdash;at this point in time at least&mdash;any series of stunts that detract from the main purpose of the Senate; that is, to consider the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, to consider the scrutiny of bills committee report that has been tabled and to consider the legislation that is before the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are entering the final stages of debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, which will culminate in a vote of the Senate. Since the bill has already been supported in the House of Representatives, its passage here would effectively confirm the current laws banning euthanasia in the states and the Australian Capital Territory and overrule the action of the Northern Territory government in legalising euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my contribution to the debate, I do not wish to canvass the constitutional position. This has been more than adequately covered in the House of Representatives. Nor do I wish to address the issue of morality&mdash;this, too, has been effectively addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us in the Senate come from different backgrounds. We bring viewpoints unique to each of us as we are not constrained by party discipline. My own perspective is from that of a doctor, one who graduated in medicine from the University of Queensland in 1956 and who has practised surgery predominantly in cancer of the breast, bowel and melanoma. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, England and Australasia. For 35 years I have taught medical students and surgical trainees and have been enriched by the experience of involvement in the process of dying of thousands of patients. I have assisted many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The titles under which I will address the bill before us tonight are doctors, diagnosis, depression, dying, duty to die and death. The training of a doctor commences generally on matriculation from high school at the age of 17 or 18. Quotas are applied and less than five per cent of the top matriculants enter the study of medicine, which usually takes six years until graduation, with a further two years of hospital training before registration to practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most matriculants are idealistic and strongly motivated to serve their fellow man. Their eight years of training emphasises the preservation and prolongation of life&mdash;death  being the ultimate enemy. On graduation, by tradition all subscribe, at least in theory, to the oath of Hippocrates, which states that no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medicine be given that will cause the death of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doctors, nonetheless, are human beings. They are subject to the same frailties as their fellow man. In fact, in many respects they suffer more. The majority are quite outstanding and held in very high regard by the community. However, there is a high social morbidity and mortality among doctors. Not only do they have a higher suicide rate but also there is a greater degree of alcoholism, drug dependency and marital breakdown than any other professional group. In essence, they are more dysfunctional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year was the fiftieth anniversary of the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, where 23 physicians and scientists were accused, amongst other matters, of euthanasia. In every profession there are some who are incompetent and inevitably a few who are venal and dangerous. It is in this category that I would put those who believe that killing can be justified by higher motives, just as those physicians and scientists did during the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those 23 physicians were accused, amongst other matters, of euthanasia of undesirable racial groups. Sixteen were found guilty and seven were sentenced to death by hanging. It is chilling to know that the main Australian proponent today is a doctor who pleads similar higher motives. It is important to note that the Australian Medical Association, the nursing profession and the overwhelming majority of the caring professions are opposed to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty&hyphen;five years ago, I attended a debate on abortion. A speaker forecast that the introduction of abortion would inevitably lead to the legalisation of euthanasia. I scoffed. In retrospect I apologise to that speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implemental steps may be slow but they are inevitable: the first step, voluntary euthanasia; the second step, involuntary euthanasia; the third step, euthanasia for specified purposes. There is only one way to prevent the slide down the slippery slope, and that is not to get on it in the first place. It is important that we stop now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1620">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second `d' is diagnosis. Before a doctor is authorised to kill, he or she must be certain of the diagnosis, that the patient is incurable and is terminally ill. I can tell you of a number of patients who have satisfied these criteria but in whom the diagnosis was wrong. One patient of mine had fluid on the lungs and fluid in the abdomen, an abdominal exploration was positive and her body was wasting. She was admitted for terminal care yet inexplicably recovered. A review of the microscopic material showed that the pathologist had made a mistake in his interpretation of the cells. I have seen that on a number of occasions. Fortunately, they are rare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pathologists are as fallible as others. You will recall a recent compensation case involving a young woman with melanoma secondaries where the diagnosis was wrong on the histological evidence, and last year another woman had an incorrect papanicolaou smear report. I have personally done a mastectomy on the basis of a frozen section report which was subsequently shown to be incorrect. Similar errors can occur in the interpretation of cat scans or magnetic resonance imaging scans&mdash;plain X-rays, even. No doctor is infallible, nor are two. Diagnosis is often difficult. It is no coincidence that a doctor, no matter how eminent or world renowned, can give only an opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I queried the diagnosis on the first patient killed under the Northern Territory legislation by asking whether an autopsy had been performed. I discovered that the legislation was flawed and the body could not be disposed of initially because nobody had considered the fact that a death certificate could not be issued at the time, as the patient had not died of natural causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the legislators upon whom we are relying for legalised killing. There is no doubt that the legislation was flawed, yet the proponents of the Northern Territory legislation are asking the upper house of the federal parliament to legitimise flawed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dying is the last great challenge of life. For some it is abrupt, but for the majority it is prolonged. In my experience it is a great privilege to be given the knowledge that one has time to prepare for death. The process has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> best been described by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On Death and Dying</EMPHASIS>. She describes five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. The penultimate stage is depression, and it is at this stage that the dying person is most vulnerable&mdash;both to themselves and to outside influences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that a seminar on suicide was held recently in Parliament House. It was apparent that the two essential components of suicide are depression and social disruption. Depression is insidious. Kubler-Ross describes two components, the first reactive and the second preparatory&mdash;a part of the grief that the terminally patient has to undergo in order to prepare for final separation from this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the bizarre features&mdash;and I speak from experience&mdash;that a doctor experienced in the care of the dying observes is premature grief in loved ones prior to the decease of the person dying. At this stage there can be enormous self-imposed pressures on the dying person to end it all and relieve the distress of their close relatives and their loved ones. This is referred to as `duty-to-die'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, voluntary euthanasia is medically assisted suicide. Suicide can also be the way an individual regains control of his or her own life by ending it. Professor Pierre Baume of the Australian Institute of Suicide Prevention says this may be summed up in a sentence: `I'll control my own destiny; I won't let you control my destiny.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proponents of euthanasia, as a last throw of the dice, brought in a spurious argument that doctors are already killing by subterfuge, an argument that it is already occurring but not regulated. I would ask the proponents to produce the evidence. I can assure the Senate it does not exist. I have been president or chairman of all the major medical organisations in my state of Queensland, stretching from President of the University of Queensland Medical Students Association, President of the Resident Medical Officers Association, Chairman of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, Chairman of the Australian Association of Surgeons and, prior to entering the Senate, President of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1621"> the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association. I have never seen it. I would ask those who propound that statement to produce the evidence. It does not exist. I know it does not exist. It does not occur. I have written to the proponents asking them for the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind all senators that this is a conscience vote. This is the first time in my nearly seven years in the Senate that this has occurred. I understand that the last time it occurred was nearly 20 years ago. I am sure that all of us will exercise that vote considering above all else our own conscience.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Looking at the merit of the Euthanasia Laws Bill, which is before the Senate today, I have been influenced by three differing perspectives. The first is a personal perspective: the death of a close family member in recent times. The second was a clearer, more deliberate form of reasoning based upon specific conclusions derived from the consideration of general issues involved in the euthanasia debate. The third was the huge amount of correspondence received in my office. Some of this correspondence in quite stark terms addressed the real issues at the heart of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the first issue: in the last 12 months a member of my family died from a longstanding illness associated with cancer. An uncle died in great pain after long suffering. His death was a release to his family. I witnessed and was informed of his great pain, his movement in and out of consciousness, the distress felt by his wife and children, the searching for false hope to relieve the pain and stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also touched by this man's strength of character to accept death, his desire and that of his family and friends to put aside longstanding disagreements and estrangement and come together to share his final days. I observed his rapprochement with sons and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brothers and the putting aside of past hates. I observed how his children put time aside to spend hours simply sitting and talking with their father and how they came to accept death as a natural event. Finally I saw how all of those people drew strength and love from the act of sharing time with him in the final days of their father's illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not surprise me for some to argue that we should have hastened his death to avoid his suffering. It is a superficially attractive but still an essentially simplistic argument. It is an argument that goes to the core of the euthanasia debate, but it is not an argument that I could draw a general principle that justifies state legislation to authorise a third party to engage in the activity of intentional killing&mdash;because that is the current practice as authorised under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As outlined in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, the Northern Territory act expressly authorises a patient in the course of a terminal illness experiencing pain, suffering or distress to request a doctor to assist the patient to terminate the patient's life. The act further provides that those persons who participate in the process shall not be subject to criminal or civil action or professional discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the intent of the Euthanasia Laws Bill is clear. The bill removes the power under the self-government acts of the three territories to enact laws which permit the form of intentional killing called euthanasia or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life. The bill also provides that the three territories shall have power to make laws with respect to traditional treatment as behaviour develops over time associated with terminal illnesses. So, notwithstanding the interesting discussion in chapter 4 about legal issues and the submissions made by a range of eminent jurists and QCs, the intent of both the Northern Territory act and the Euthanasia Laws Bill are reasonably clear to this particular layman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, having somewhat briefly dispensed with the arcane legal arguments, one can address the issue in terms of broad principle. The Northern Territory act expressly gives the power and hence a licence to membership of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1622"> one group in our society to engage in the activity of legalised homicide. Doctors, medical practitioners, are apparently so special, so wise, so well-informed and so across complex moral and ethical issues that the state in the form of the Northern Territory government has issued them with a licence to engage in a form of killing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This raises the fundamental issue of the appropriate divide between the state and the individual. All over the world we see government in retreat. It is said that the market is supreme. There is no role for state assistance, state regulation, state involvement. Corporations are privatising, the labour market is deregulated and Australian companies are required to compete on unequal playing fields. Welfare assistance to families is withdrawn and age pensions apparently are to become an individual responsibility. In nearly all other fields of activity the state is winding back its influence at a rate of knots inconceivable 20 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in parts of Australia the role of the state is so paramount that 5,000 years of recorded history, both East and West, is to be turned upon its head. I am greatly troubled by this paradigm shift of power. Individual freedom is a precious right. Few citizens and few countries enjoy it to an absolute degree. Time and time again we hear of abuses of power by governments, bureaucracies, state agencies and security forces. Quite properly we are troubled by the intervention of the state in our bedrooms. Quite properly that issue is the subject of real discussion in our society, yet that issue is not resolved. There is no consensus viewpoint. Yet the Northern Territory Act sanctions the killing of our citizens by other citizens whose only qualification is that they are medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate there are a number of doctors: Dr Brown, Dr Herron, Dr Eggleston, Dr Crowley. The former Senator Woods is a cancer specialist. They all bring widely different philosophic viewpoints to a range of debates, all make worthwhile contributions, but none, with due respect, are so wise and so on top of complex ethical issues that the state should presume to licence them to be an arbiter of life or death. So the act of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory government or any other government in licensing doctors to assist in the killing of terminally ill patients is something I find greatly worrying, deeply offensive and a cause for real concern for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having stated a major problem with state intervention or state licence in this matter, one needs to inevitably consider the issue of other groups in our society. That of course needs to be done in context. We all know that medical costs, drug costs, costs of nursing homes and costs of training doctors, nurses and health professionals are rising dramatically and in some cases almost exponentially. We know that pension and aged care costs are on the rise. We know the work force is contracting in relative terms. We know that the taxation base is dwindling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paradoxically, there are increased demands for provision of new government services. Soon, governments will say, `There is no more. We will not levy additional taxation.' Economists, if they are not doing it already, in the not too distant future will cost the provision of service to the dependent or needy groups. If doctors can assist the death of the terminally ill, others will argue that we should assess the contribution of these other groups. Some will suggest this argument is fanciful. Why should the legislation not apply to retarded persons, paraplegic and quadriplegic individuals, persons with debilitating illnesses, persons suffering from mental diseases? The list is potentially endless. If the state has the right to sanction and authorise the killing or death of one group of citizens, it seems to me that that is an absolute right and can be extended to other groups in our society. In this debate, we cannot have relative rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you cross the line of absolute prohibition in the taking of another's life, you cannot, in my view, attempt to restrict that absolute right. Logically it is a contradictory position. There is either an absolute right for the state to legislate to licence the killers of its own citizens or there is not. I for one will vote against giving the state that absolute right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, I wish to make two other observations: firstly, the issue of palliative care and, secondly, the rights of groups who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1623"> might be affected by this debate in the future. I was greatly helped in my deliberations by the Senate discussion on palliative care in chapter 6 of the report. Paragraph 6.74 stated that palliative care is the active, total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, of other symptoms and of other psychological, social and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal is the achievement of the best quality of life for patients and their families. Dr Smith from the Australian Association of Hospice and Palliative Care made the following points: palliative care is a developing treatment and there is much confusion about what palliative care is and how it is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of knowledge or skill required to effectively manage the symptoms of people in such dire circumstances that they seek euthanasia is still not achieved by enough medical practitioners. The availability of euthanasia in such cases can lead to an undertreatment of such symptoms and an overall worsening of the quality of life. Basically Dr Smith submitted that the introduction of euthanasia legislation will paradoxically worsen the quality of life and care of the very group it is attempting to aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another report in the field of palliative care explained that suffering when dying takes two forms. Firstly, there are organic problems such as pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation and depression. With very few exceptions, Dr Smith reported, all of these problems can be handled satisfactorily by an expert palliative care team. Secondly, there are existential problems in loss of self&hyphen;worth, loss of control, fear, guilt, anger and resentment. According to Professor Ravenscroft, it is the second group of problems that lead patients to request euthanasia more often than the pain does. Dr Smith went on to explain that this caused problems for doctors, as they were often not adequately trained to deal with these most difficult issues. However, these problems can be addressed by skills, such as counselling, which many doctors have not been taught or have not been able to master.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the evidence shows that requests for euthanasia are extremely rare when concerted efforts are made to alleviate physical, spiritual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and emotional suffering. According to the evidence, requests for euthanasia are usually a call for help rather than a call for euthanasia itself. Even Professor Baume acknowledged that for 95 per cent of people palliative care is very effective and it is a developing technique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our society should be allocating resources to get that figure up from 95 per cent to as near as is humanly possible to the absolute figure. It is incorrect to say that the two, three, four or five per cent who are not totally assisted by palliative care do not gain any relief. They gain some relief. As Dr Smith explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The group of people who do not get complete relief of their symptoms do receive a proportionate degree of relief.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 95 per cent of cases, palliative care is a complete answer and, in the remaining cases, which is an absolutely declining figure, there is some relief. This is a powerful argument alone for supporting the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of alternative solutions for those who face terminal illness, I was struck by the nature of the argument for the rejection of the bill before the parliament. The correspondence received in my electorate office reflected the summarised arguments for euthanasia in chapter 6 of the report. As I considered the correspondence, I was struck by the analogy with the capital punishment debate. Often I was influenced by the argument of putting to death an innocent person. Indeed, the investigations of the current inquiry in New South Wales suggest that a significant number of senior and powerful people routinely lie to achieve their purpose. I think it would be a remarkable conclusion that police officers, lawyers and judges have not conspired in the past to wrongly convict accused persons. We are fortunate that capital punishment is no longer on our statute books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the argument concerning euthanasia comes down to five: individual rights, choice, compassion and death with dignity, legalising common practice, and moral equivalence. Those arguments have varying degrees of strength, the weakest in my view being that of legalising common practice. The Senate committee did not report any empirical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1624"> evidence to support this argument and I suspect it is argued more often that it is practised. I draw some support for this view from the rigorous, consistent and continuing opposition expressed in surveys which show significant doctor opposition to the practice of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the view of the AMA on behalf of doctors was strongly opposed to the legalisation of euthanasia, which suggests the argument for common practice is not as strong as its proponents suggest. Indeed, apart from a number of pro&hyphen;euthanasia lobby groups and like organisations, I was repeatedly struck by the lack of any widespread publicly supported move for legalising euthanasia. In the bulk of correspondence received in my office, approximately 50 private submissions out of 1,500 argued a pro&hyphen;euthanasia position. That is quite a revealing statistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The various pro&hyphen;euthanasia societies basically address the issue from a philosophic or ethical perspective. A small number of individuals wrote opposing the Andrews' bill principally because they had observed suffering of a family member. If these two groups are removed from the debate, I am left with the question: who is actually in favour of legalising euthanasia? I am unable to give a clear response to that question. In response, I conclude that I do not know that a lot of terminally ill people do wish to die. The extent of demand for palliative care treatments and its evident high success rate suggests there is little public or private clamour for legalising euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect people do not want to die. I suspect people want medical treatment, want palliative care and want the state to provide a viable public health system to help in their dire moment of need. These are logical and sensible positions for people to hold. I suspect the great mass of Australians would favour further public assistance to help those people. Indeed, legalising euthanasia is a concern because it sends a message to a lot of Australians that their life is no longer worth anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last six months alone, there has been a developing debate about youth suicide and, in particular, young male teenage suicide. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence suggests that these boys killed themselves because, like a character from a Camus novel, they have no hope, they feel totally isolated, they feel alone and without parental community or societal support. Because they are alone, they feel stressed, depressed and unable to see a way through the mire of their own hopelessness. How are they any different from the terminally ill? If state assisted homicide is good enough for the terminally ill, why should not the state assist those young men and women who want to choose to end their own lives? Both have their roots in the same cause: isolation, depression, tension, stress, an inability to cope. In reality, both are making pleas for help, pleas for assistance. Both are saying that they want to be part of our community. They are not sending a plea to help end their lives. They are sending this plea&mdash;help make my life worthwhile. That is a most reasonable request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passage of this bill in the most minor way sends a message to those young boys and girls that their life, all life, is important. It is not beyond the realms of possibility to comprehend a situation where children might apply oblique pressure on parents to do the right thing for their own financial gain. Independent terminally ill people might place less value on their lives than others because of stress or isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in this context, one should address the question of opinion polls. They show that around 75 per cent of people favour euthanasia. I suspect that high affirmative response relates to the wording of the question. A differently phrased question or one with more detail or explanation might result in a different answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I have been struck by the different voting responses in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The bill under debate today, and during this week, passed through the House by 88 to 35 on third reading. I am told that the vote in the Senate will probably be a margin of one to four votes. Why is there such a difference in the two Houses? My suspicion is that lower House members have reacted to community pressure and lobbying and senators by and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1625"> large are able to be guided by their own consciences on this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I support this bill because it is a small step toward achieving community responsibility and community obligation. It treats all citizens the same and does not draw a distinction between those who are terminally ill and the remainder of the population. It does not draw a distinction between citizens of the Northern Territory and the rest of Australia. Finally, and most importantly, it limits the power of the state in an area in which the state has no role.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senators Herron and Bishop, I support the Euthanasia Laws Bill. My reasons for doing so are more than adequately set out in the advice to the Senate which was included in the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report which I signed, along with 12 other senators. I do not want to take up the Senate's time by expanding unduly on the reasons why the 13 of us who signed that believe that this bill should be passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to take the opportunity to say that it does not give me any pleasure at all to be voting in favour of a Commonwealth bill to override an otherwise valid law of the Northern Territory. I am, in principle, very much a federalist and that is one of the reasons I am in the Senate. I am never very favourably disposed to Commonwealth laws which seek to override the otherwise valid laws of states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I was disappointed by some of the speeches in the House of Representatives which treated the Northern Territory with contempt, which sought to belittle that jurisdiction. I personally have a very great regard for the Northern Territory, for the achievements of the people and the recent governments since self&hyphen;government and I am very optimistic about their territory's future, indeed so optimistic that one could say that the state of South Australia was very unwise to give the Northern Territory away to the Commonwealth in the earlier history of this federation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a very great regard for Chief Minister Shane Stone who I think has done a superlative job as chief minister. I have known him for many years and knew him well when he was President of the CLP in the Northern Territory. So I certainly mean no slight whatsoever to the territory in indicating my support for this bill, but we have here a bill passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly which does apply to every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may be under the misapprehension that the Northern Territory legislation applies only to Northern Territorians; it does not. Every Australian is affected by it. Already a resident of my state of South Australia has been killed under the provisions of this law. In relation to this issue of states' rights the fact is, whether the territory or the rest of us like it or not, the territory is not yet a state. I believe and hope that one day that will occur but the fact is it is not a state, it is a territory. That is its constitutional position and it is a territory for which the Commonwealth has responsibility. In the case of this most extraordinary law it is my view that that responsibility must be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember that this was a law passed by only one vote in the single chamber of the Northern Territory parliament, the Legislative Assembly. One of the strongest and most persuasive speeches against the Northern Territory law was given by none other than the Chief Minister, Shane Stone. I think it is worth referring briefly to his speech which some have overlooked. On 24 May 1995 in the Legislative Assembly he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some believe that both practices, of assisted suicide and euthanasia, are morally wrong and should not be allowed . . . I am firmly in this category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the member for Fannie Bay's private bill proposes is to transform the right to decide about medical treatment into a far broader right to control the timing and manner of death. I am firmly of the persuasion that the dangers of such a dramatic change in public policy would far outweigh any possible benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simple fact is that there is a huge difference between helping a person to die as opposed to killing someone. I believe that distinction has been lost on the proponents of the bill. The moment that you legalise doctors killing their patients, even with their consent and with benevolent motives, you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1626"> cross an important threshold. You debase the currency of human life. The potential for error and abuse, the risk to vulnerable individuals and the profound effect on society's values present the most compelling reasons against allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could not possibly say it any better than Shane Stone did in the debate in the parliament of the Northern Territory. I agree completely with him. I was going to say something about opinion polls, that being something with which I am extremely familiar through professional practice but Senator Bishop has put it as well as I could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the alleged support for euthanasia is support for the right to be allowed to die. I think that is the way people are interpreting the question that was put to them. I do not believe that there is popular support for legislation allowing doctors to kill patients. If we are going to take public opinion as our guide in this we would be all supporting capital punishment because polls consistently show that a majority of Australians support capital punishment. I do not notice those who rely on public opinion polls to support euthanasia also advocating capital punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to briefly place on record my concern about the effects of the Northern Territory law on Aboriginal health in the territory, given my particular responsibility in native title. That subject is of concern to me. We are all well aware of the magnitude of the problems of Aboriginal health across this country, but particularly in the Northern Territory. The Senate committee report provides, in my view, overwhelming evidence that this law could do untold damage to our efforts to improve Aboriginal health. There is quite a compelling section in there about the person hired by the Northern Territory government to talk to Aborigines about this euthanasia law who strongly recommends that the bill be repealed because of the potential for it to have disastrous effects on efforts to improve Aboriginal health. I would have thought that for people like Senator Brown that alone should be a very compelling reason to think seriously about whether this bill should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very difficult issue for all of us. It is one of those rare occasions when we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to exercise a conscience vote. It is not easy for me as someone who does in principle believe in the right of lesser jurisdictions to make valid laws. But in this case I must, as a matter of conscience, support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too welcome the opportunity to speak to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I indicate from the outset that I intend to support this bill. It has not been an easy decision because I do not know of any other matter that has been brought before this parliament on which my colleagues and I have received so much personal correspondence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the correspondence was in the way of form letters, but there were many individual letters written to me and my office citing individual cases and expressing both sides of the argument. For that reason, this is a very difficult decision. It is not difficult for me to make because I have felt the same way since the bill was first introduced, but it is difficult because of the amount of feeling that has been put into that correspondence by the various people holding a variety of views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point was made even more closely last Friday night. I attended a function at which a relation of mine who was down from Katherine in the Northern Territory asked me, `Why would you seek to overturn the Northern Territory's right to legislate for itself?' I said, `It is very simple. I wouldn't do that but neither do you, as territorians, have a right to legislate for all other Australians and, on this particular case, on a life and death matter.' If the Northern Territory had chosen to pass this legislation and to have it apply to only Northern Territory citizens or citizens who had resided in the Northern Territory for a period of time, I would have much more difficulty in supporting this bill. That is one right that I do believe they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, because this legislation has been passed in the Northern Territory and because, as my colleague Senator Minchin has said, of those people who have availed themselves of the legislation I think only one was a territorian and the rest have been people from other states in Australia, my conscience dictates that I should support this bill. The Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1627"> Territory has passed legislation on a life and death matter to legislate for every other Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just over 20 years ago I watched my father die in considerable pain. That was before the days when palliative care of the quality that is now available was available to patients. At no stage did I ever think that my father would have wished to end his own life. I know that does not apply to every single situation. But I am concerned and my own conscience is that the law as it is put forward&mdash;and as I think has been put so ably by Senator Bishop previously regarding the many matters that he raised in his speech&mdash;is such that there is no way that I could not support the Andrews's bill. That bill overturns the legislation which was passed in the Northern Territory; legislation which now applies to all Australians as it stands. They can if they want to go to the Northern Territory without spending any time  there as residents of the Northern Territory and avail themselves of the euthanasia legislation and be participants in voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the feelings of those who feel differently about this matter from the way that I do. Strong feelings have been expressed from both sides of the argument on this issue. As I said previously, I like many others have received more correspondence on this issue than any other. However, at the end of the day, as this is a conscience vote and as we have been asked to exercise our own consciences on this very important matter, my conscience dictates that I must support the Euthanasia Laws Bill, or what is otherwise known as the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated at the start of my speech, I intend to support this bill. I know that by Thursday night a lot of speeches will be made on a variety of issues&mdash;some emotional, some perhaps less emotional, some from people who feel very strongly about this issue and some from people who do not feel so strongly. Some will still be making up their minds as to which way they will vote, although I think they are very few in number. But I know that there are still one or two people who are not sure which way they should vote in this matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope during the next three nights when this bill is being debated that it will be debated in a rational manner. I hope that people will express their own convictions and let the Senate know the way their conscience dictates that they should vote. When we come to the final vote after the debate on the second reading stage is finished, I hope that vote is respected in the knowledge that every senator who has cast their vote on this will have done so as their conscience dictates that they must.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not intend to speak for very long because I know that there is a considerable number of speakers on this bill, and the opportunity to get some of these speeches completed tonight is a bonus to our program. I thank the Senate for the opportunity for expressing my point of view in this matter. Once again, I indicate that I will be supporting the euthanasia bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that I will be voting to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. Because this is a conscience vote and I understand that this happens very rarely in the Senate, I indicate that I came to this debate and the consideration of this matter not as a politician, not as a lawyer, not as a doctor but as a human being. I simply wanted to consider the matter in the quiet of my own conscience and to ultimately come to a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many other senators, I have had hundreds if not a thousand letters in my office urging me to vote one way or the other. I will not pretend not to admit that many of these letters presented some compelling circumstances for voting one way or the other. But I have made up my mind to support the bill for probably four main reasons. The first reason is a fundamental belief that we should not allow one person to decide whether or not the life of another human being should end. I simply cannot take the decision to allow that to pass into legislation, which is why I will support the bill to overturn the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, like Senator Ferguson, I believe that even though I am a strong supporter of federation, it is wrong for a state or territory to impose a law on the rest of the country. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1628"> This is no ordinary legislation. It deals with the most fundamental question which every person in this chamber and every person in this nation ultimately faces, and that is the question of life and death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As politicians, we have had many messages from Northern Territory parliamentarians, including one message which arrived today saying that this debate is not about active voluntary euthanasia but about states rights. I beg to differ. With great respect, I must say that this debate is about life and death, and it must be in the federal context and in the interests of this nation that we consider this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I did receive in my office an overwhelming number of letters, and some of them certainly presented compelling cases. I have experienced enough of life to know that, if it is deemed necessary to end a person's life by decision of the person involved, it is possible for that decision to be taken and implemented usually by a passive choice for action, in that action is not taken to prolong life. I understand that it is the choice of many compassionate doctors and probably many patients who feel that they are unable to go on living in the way that they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to take an active decision to kill someone is not something that I can contemplate. I am also enough of a cynic to believe that unscrupulous relatives will take advantage of a person in a weakened physical state to end that person's life and thereby gain advantage for themselves. I know this is not an argument that usually is advanced against euthanasia. But certainly many of the crime histories that one reads in the newspapers and the way in which elderly people can be dealt with most unfortunately in this modern society of 1997 lead me to believe that many people would take advantage of that particular position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe, with Senator Bishop, that to acquiesce in the Northern Territory legislation sends a most unfortunate message to the youth of our society. Many of them, through circumstances totally beyond their control, feel that work is meaningless because they have none, families are meaningless because they have none and, ultimately, their life is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meaningless&mdash;and so they may decide to deprive themselves of that life. Youth suicide is one of the most alarming problems that we have to face in our society. To undertake any moves, certainly by parliament or by the territory legislature, which I consider would encourage that are only to be deplored. We need to inspire in our young people a capacity to enjoy life to the fullest and to the longest, and to make the most of the life that they have. To acquiesce in the Northern Territory legislation would totally negate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, a decision which is taken actively to end life is a decision with which I cannot agree. Therefore, I will be voting to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the interests of the orderly conduct of the business of the Senate, I too will be brief. If time permitted, there are many more points I would wish to make, even though many of these undoubtedly will be made by other speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I speak in this debate at all is that I believe the people of Australia&mdash;each one of whom at some point in their lives may be affected in some way or another, either personally or through the suffering of a beloved family member or friend&mdash;have the right to know why each of us here in this chamber votes in a particular way on this intensely sensitive and emotional issue: an issue that embraces our role both as individuals and as collective members of society; and an issue that embraces our views on the sanctity of life and whether we as human beings have the right to choose the moment of our passing from this life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a debate that in many respects goes to the very core of our human beingness. It is a debate that embraces our religious beliefs. It is a debate that must pay due regard to the constitutional position of the federal, state and territory legislatures. It also is a debate about whether any government has the moral or other right to legislate with respect to the right of any human being to seek death by other than natural causes. Even if one answers yes to this fundamental latter question, there is then the further fundamental question of whether such a law can be administered and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1629"> monitored in a way that ensures the more vulnerable in our society are not left even more vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of these issues and questions can be, and is, argued persuasively by the proponents of opposite points of view. Vast tracts of complex legal, medical, ethical and philosophical discourses have been written on them. None of them can be judged unequivocally to provide an unambiguous answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only cast my vote on the Euthanasia Laws Bill on the basis of how I feel and what I feel is the right approach. You can argue the legalities and the complexities until you are blue in the face. But these are to no avail on such a deeply personal and emotional issue, unless you feel deep inside you that the decision you take is the one you believe in as a human being. On that basis, I indicate that I will vote for the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 because to do otherwise would for me be to deny the sanctity of life itself.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also hasten to say, however, that I fully respect the equally deeply held views of many of those who take the opposing approach. I also want to say to my friends in the Northern Territory who oppose the bill because they believe it tramples on their rights as territorians to determine their own laws, that I understand their position, which is one I would generally fully support&mdash;even though in this particular instance there is no doubt that the federal parliament has the constitutional right to pass the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the issues in this bill go far beyond federal, state and territory considerations. They go to the heart of what I believe to be the very essence of a civilised, compassionate society&mdash;and that is that life is sacred, and that no-one has the right to take another's life, even if the person whose life is at issue wishes it to be done.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11 p.m." PAGE="1629"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 11 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Hong Kong's boat person population under the now terminated Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) currently numbers 4,517 persons who were screened out and therefore found not to be refugees and 1,346 persons who either arrived before 16 June 1988 or arrived after that date and were screened in as refugees and are eligible for resettlement under the CPA. As a party to the CPA, Australia encourages Vietnamese boat people found not to be refugees to return to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hong Kong, unlike other first asylum countries under the CPA, allows screened out boat people to apply to migrate to a third country. A small number, principally spouses, have migrated to Australia. It is unlikely that there are many remaining in the camp who would be eligible to migrate to Australia under the family reunion program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The number of boat people in Hong Kong with relatives in Australia is not available, but it is believed to be small. I am unable to speculate why these people did not take advantage of the previous Government's offer to resettle them in Australia if they returned to Vietnam. (To be eligible for this program persons needed to return to Vietnam before 1 January 1996.) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1632">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government has no plans or proposals under consideration to assist the Hong Kong authorities to remove the screened out population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of UNHCR, Australia is considering a small number of cases from the remaining population of 1,346 people who are eligible to be resettled. To be accepted they will need to meet Australia's stringent health and character requirements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There has been no decision to remove the right of appeal by disability support pensioners, or any other Department of Social Security customers, from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent review of the Social Security Review and appeals system is currently being undertaken by the Hon Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. The terms of reference of the review include an examination of the number of levels of review within the Social Security portfolio, the impact of review and appeal decisions on the quality and efficiency of decision-making by DSS staff, the operation, membership and powers of the SSAT and whether or not there should be a right of appeal to the AAT. Dame Margaret has been asked to report on these matters by May 1997. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Any decision to remove or amend the right of appeal of Social Security customers to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would require legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Customers claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP), or subject to a medical review of their DSP, are required to obtain a report from their treating doctor. In many cases a report is also sought from an Australian Government Health Service (AGHS) Medical Officer following a medical examination. The reports supplied by treating doctors will vary in their quality and usefulness. Reports supplied by AGHS Medical Officers are usually of a high standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Department of Social Security liaises closely with the AGHS to ensure the highest possible quality of medical reports provided in respect of DSS customers. New versions of DSP Treating Doctor Report forms have also been developed following consultations with DSS staff and the medical community. These are currently being trialed in South Australia and Western Australia and, following further refinement, are expected to be released shortly. This new form is expected to improve the overall quality of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5 &amp; 6) Federal funding for legal aid is a matter for the Attorney-General's portfolio. Very few customers who appeal to the SSAT or AAT use legal representation or have been granted legal aid in recent years and any changes in legal aid arrangements will therefore have little, if any, overall impact.</PARA>
