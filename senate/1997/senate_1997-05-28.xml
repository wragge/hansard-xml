<PARA STYLE="Para">At close of play last night I had almost concluded my remarks on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. The opposition is moving an amendment to the second reading of this bill. Our amendment has been circulated in the chamber. It is an amendment which puts the onus back on the government to, in our view, honour the undertakings that it foreshadowed with the industry. Our purpose in moving this amendment is to require the government to come clean and say that, as a result of its negotiations with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, the Amalgamated Prospectors and Leaseholders Association and the Minerals Council of Australia, it should now honour its
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undertaking and declare that it will not put a cap on legitimate claims for diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those senators who are aware of this issue know that the government entered into negotiations with the industry. The industry sought that there be no cap applied to growth in areas of legitimate entitlement, whereas the government sought to limit the scope of this rebate. The scope of the rebate has been limited, but the cap has not been formally announced by the government. We believe that, in order to honour the understandings reached in those negotiations, the government should now make that declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment also seeks an unequivocal undertaking that the government honours its election commitment. In the election it said that it would neither introduce new taxes nor extend existing taxes. By narrowing further the scope of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, you in fact extend existing taxes. But the particular point of our amendment is to seek an indication from the government that it will not be increasing the amount of diesel fuel excise, so that it can be consistent with what it told the electors at the last national poll. I therefore commend this amendment to the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note as well that Senator Murray, of the Australian Democrats, has moved an amendment to the second reading motion. That amendment is in many respects the antithesis of what we the opposition have proposed. It therefore will not be a surprise to anyone to find that we will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude on this bill by saying that diesel fuel taxes were introduced initially in order to cover the cost of road maintenance and building and it was levied initially on major transport users of the roads. It has become of course levied across all industry where the diesel fuel is used. A rebate is provided because to tax inputs on production in agriculture and in mining is to make our producers uncompetitive in the domestic and international markets. An input tax does that. It pushes up the price of the good and reduces the competitiveness of Australian industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3818">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that the diesel fuel rebate should account for a removal of that uncompetitiveness and should be done across the board where it has been introduced. That is to say: where an input tax applies, with certain qualifications the rebate should be operative so that we are not putting a brake on growth, economic development and the possibility of employment. This bill narrows the application of the rebate and is a backdoor way of simply grabbing money from the industry which will in fact put a brake on its development and its ability to create employment, and it is done by narrowing the application of the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving several amendments in the committee stage of this legislation in order to direct the bill to its original and proper intent. We will be looking for support for that in the chamber. I hope it is forthcoming so that this industry can have prospects of further growth and prospects of further advantage to the national economy and to employment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose Labor's amendment to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The amendment effectively gives further assurances to the mining industry about this diesel fuel rebate. Senator Cook has put Labor firmly in the position of being even more in support of this massive handout to the mining industry than the conservatives. This is at a time when, right across the board, social welfare in this country is being cut to ribbons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing massive cuts to education and health. A whole range of job creation schemes has gone west, and in the past there have been cuts to spending on the environment. But sheltered from all that is the mining industry's massive handout on a platter of some $800 million each year for doing nothing. They simply get their taxes handed back to them. If only other citizens could get that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that. But it is strangely at odds with the effort being put into protecting the mining industry and all its chief executive officers, including six in BHP alone, who will this year be taking home
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than $1 million&mdash;one of them more than $3 million&mdash;in their wage package deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and Labor opposition are saying, `Let's give these people $800 million. Let's give BHP alone a cheque for over $100 million for nothing&mdash;just a return on their taxes. Everybody else has to pay those taxes on diesel fuel, but we will give the miners&mdash;'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have two sections here: one is the farming community and the second is the mining community. I am picking out the mining community as being given special treatment. We see that the farming community is in hard times but we cannot say that for the mining industry. I am saying that you will not find too many farmers out there who are taking home $1 million in pay deals, but you will find plenty of mining chief executive officers who are doing just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the government giving the mining industry $800 million, based on a past Labor Party arrangement. The government says that it cannot make ends meet. It is cutting to ribbons a whole range of things. It has even cut out a $2.9 million book allowance for street kids who try to get back into education. That has been cut out because the government could not find money for it. But it can find $800 million for mining companies to help pad the million&hyphen;dollar&hyphen;plus salaries going to their chief executive officers. It is absurd. It is obscene. It is the stuff of division in this country as we see it move towards the haves having more and the have&hyphen;nots having less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, through this amendment, is saying, `Let's protect them even further. Let's not put any cap on the current diesel fuel rebate, and let's get an unequivocal undertaking that the government will stick by its election commitment not to introduce new taxes or extend existing taxes by increasing the diesel fuel excise.' That might be consistent for the Labor Party, but to me it sits strangely at odds with the government's ability to cut deep into the social welfare net that we have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand where the Labor Party is coming from because, when in office, it also
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3819"> pursued an economic rationalist program. It was aimed at giving assistance to resource extraction industries, like the woodchip industry and the mining industry. I think they can look after themselves. They do well enough from effectively being given a natural resource, which belongs to the people of Australia, for their own profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not naive enough to believe that people are going to be able to look forward to the future that they aspire to without minerals and without wood products, and so on. But what I object to is the serial reduction in the requirements for those who make such huge profits out of the natural resources of this country to (a) give a fair return to the people who own those resources and (b) abide by reasonable environmental protection in respect of where they can and cannot extract those resources and how they extract those resources when they get to them. Serially, under Labor, and now with a foot on the accelerator under the conservatives, those reasonable requirements of government for a fair return of natural resources to the people and a wise protection of the environment are being dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the situation where the Labor Party is saying, `The Liberals and Nationals aren't doing a good enough job for the mining companies. We want to shelter them in respect of not only the profitability of the mineral extraction business which they are in but also this massive handout from government to these massively rich corporations and their corporate executives.' Not for one minute would I entertain supporting this Labor amendment. The Australian Greens will be opposing it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank all senators for their contributions, except for Senator Brown who of course goes on with his normal bile and vitriol that he has become famous for in this place. There were some fairly sensible contributions and I would like to comment on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will respond to Senator Cook who has taken the lead for the opposition on this matter. I will not go over all the stuff that went through the economics committee. This is not the place to do it. I could not help but note the remarks by the Clerk in regard to committees and their effectiveness. This is a matter that was very well aired in the economics committee and to repeat the whole process in the committee stage of the bill makes a mockery of the committee system and everyone in Senate should take that on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook made the point throughout that somehow this government had not honoured its agreements. I must respond to this in a few words. When the government came into office it found that&mdash;and this is something that the previous government attempted to address but not successfully&mdash;the diesel fuel rebate was growing exponentially at a rate that was far greater than the growth of the industry and inflation. As a result of that, meetings were convened with the mining industry and the problem put on the table. It was a different approach to the one taken by the previous government through the then minister, Senator Schacht, who fact attempted to sandbag the industry. The problem was put on the table. The industry took what I believe was a very responsible approach to work with the government to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of addressing that problem, the industry offered up certain proposals that were accepted by the government. This included things like 3&half;&hyphen;tonne vehicles and addressing the Dampier Salt case. I might point out that the problem with the Dampier Salt case was not so much Dampier Salt itself, but the flow&hyphen;on effects that could have occurred. Customs estimated that, if these had been pursued legally by other parts of the mining industry where the diesel fuel rebate would have applied but which is not the intent of the act, it may well have cost revenue about $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook mentioned that the government did break an election undertaking. This is not the case. This was done in cooperation with the industry. Senator Murphy in his speech talked about the limestone mines. He
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3820"> indicated that I may well have misled an estimates committee when I pointed out that the removal of the diesel fuel rebate for limestone was in fact done by the previous government. Just to make absolutely sure on that, I did a double check and that is exactly the case. What happened when we came into government was that an amendment was put through to an act which enabled limestone used for agricultural purposes to actually get the diesel fuel rebate. In regard to limestone for cement making, that was removed by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone suggested&mdash;and I think it might have been Senator Cook&mdash;there is some court case going on at the moment regarding extraction from minerals. However, that is a separate matter. Limestone is limestone and what it is used for in the mine is calcine and it is then used in the cement industry. The question of the mining of limestone was certainly dealt with by the previous government and not by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee stage I foreshadow that I will move amendments to this bill. I would also remind the Senate that when the bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) foreshadowed that there would be amendments based on further discussions with the industry. At the time the economics committee met those amendments were not available. They were subsequently provided to members of that committee. In bringing forward these amendments, which I will introduce in the committee stage, account has been taken of the issues put to the Senate economics legislation committee in its hearing on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided not to proceed with defining `beneficiation' in an exhaustive way. Therefore, whether a process does or does not constitute beneficiation for the purpose of the diesel fuel rebate scheme will continue to be a matter to be decided on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis. In this connection the government has decided that the meaning of `beneficiation' should be settled based on technical evidence in the respect of the processes and should not involve market con
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> siderations that might affect a decision as to how far the mineral ore is processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the government has decided to insert a clause in the bill to reflect this. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that only technical considerations and not marketing considerations are taken into account&mdash;for example, when tribunals and courts assess whether a particular beneficiation process should be eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision not to include a definition of `beneficiation' means that eligible mining activities, other than those explicitly identified for removal in the joint ministerial statement of 31 October 1996 made by Minister Prosser and myself, together with changes proposed to the legislation to avoid further widening of the scheme beyond its intent, will continue to be eligible. Rebate claims within the eligible category at, for example, Mount Isa will continue. Customs will ensure that only legitimate claims receive rebate and will pursue in courts or tribunals as necessary matters which are clearly outside the scope of the scheme and contrary to the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the definition of beneficiation will not proceed, the government has decided it remains necessary to address the recent AAT and federal court decisions which expanded the coverage of the scheme beyond which it was intended. Three decisions were involved: Dampier Salt, Dyno&hyphen;Westfarmers and Temco. These cases were all addressed in the original bill. However, in the light of the decision to not proceed with the definition of beneficiation, it is necessary to include an amendment that is specifically related to manganese&mdash;that is, the Temco case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to address these issues, in particular the common salt and manganese issues, is related to these products only and does not reflect the disposition that the question of beneficiation in relation to other minerals is to be determined broadly. The widening effects of these cases is also addressed in the amendment relating to market considerations mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the decision not to provide a definition for the term beneficiation and the specific amendments to address the Temco
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3821"> case, the amendment to the definition of minerals is not only proceeded with but there is an amendment to clarify the provision covering return journeys from the place of beneficiation to the mining site. This amendment makes it clear that all stages that constitute a return journey, other than a sea leg, provided these are undertaken for the purpose of repeating the transport of minerals or ores for beneficiation, are eligible for rebate. In particular, the word `direct' has been removed from the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scope of the provision that covers the construction or maintenance of dams or other works to store or contain water is being extended. The amendment specifically provides that such activity is eligible for rebate when the storage facility is to be used to contain water which is obtained in conducting a mining operation&mdash;that is, the pumping out of water from a mine where the water contains contaminants as well as the storage water that has been contaminated in the mining operation that precludes its release into the environment. A regulation making power is being inserted to cater for any technological changes that may need to be accommodated under the term beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision relating to the application of the revised eligibility criteria to fuel purchased prior to the date of commencement of the legislation has been amended. The revised version makes it clear that claims must be received by the Australian Customs Service within three months of the date of commencement of the legislation to be able to receive rebate under the previously existing conditions. Concerns have been expressed to the government that the record keeping provisions of the bill would be construed as prescriptive requiring the keeping of logbooks and operating records. This was never the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the diesel fuel record keeping obligations in proposed section 24OA(2) of the Customs Act 1901 and proposed section 128A(2) of the Excise Act 1901 clarify the proposed requirements to keep diesel fuel records by removing any suggestion that particular types of records have to be kept. The inclusion in the bill of a reference
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to logbooks and other operating records to evidence the actual nature of the use of fuel for which rebate has been claimed was intended to be an example of the type of record that might be kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an applicant for diesel fuel rebate has other records which can substantiate the actual nature of the use of the fuel, these records will be sufficient for the purpose of the document retention obligation. The onus is on the user of the fuel to keep such records as are necessary to demonstrate that the actual use of the fuel was an eligible activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding the debate on the bill, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that the Federal Court has recently confirmed the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that vehicles known as mobile manufacturing units were eligible for rebate when they were driven on public roads to mine sites on the basis that the journeys undertaken by them could be characterised as integral to mining for minerals. In this context, the government regards the concept of rebate being paid for any activity that is regarded as integral to, connected with, associated with or related to, as being contrary to the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rebates should only be paid for activities which fall squarely within one of the paragraphs of the definition of mining operations. The parliament has already determined the activities that have a sufficient connection with mining. Other than these activities, no other activities can be admitted to the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains an amendment to specifically negate the issue of rebate being paid for vehicles travelling on public roads in the mining operations category. This amendment ensures the rebate is not paid on fuels used to propel any vehicle on a public road, even if the journeys undertaken by the vehicle can otherwise be characterised as integral to one of the activities listed in the relevant definition. In so doing, the government is confirming that the diesel fuel rebate scheme is a targeted scheme. It is intended to pay rebate strictly in respect of those activities that form part of the definition of mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we will not be supporting the opposition's amendment. I would just like to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3822"> point out that Senator Cook mentioned that the Democrats were going to move a second reading amendment, but I understand that that is not the case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The substance of our amendments is to eliminate the diesel rebate from mining, phasing it out over a period of three years. The first year would see the rebate rate per litre cut in half, the next year would see it cut in half again and in the third year it would be set at zero. Amendment 1 changes the commencement to eliminate the phased treatment of the current bill since the elimination of the rebate would require only one commencement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed the minister's response to Senator Brown was that he thanked all other participants in the second reading debate but distinguished Senator Brown by saying he would not thank him. I think it is very symbolic of the government's response to issues of environment and ecological sustainability&mdash;they do not thank anybody for pointing those out to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining rebate is a subsidy that costs taxpayers nearly a million dollars a year and it is rising each year. It is paid mainly to large transnational corporations that increasingly repatriate profits or invest them overseas. It is a low employment industry where imported workers and management are common. It is an industry which relies heavily on imports of production equipment. Rural communities, aside from mining company towns, generally see little of the money passing through the hands of these companies and their workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember following through a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of North West Shelf liquefied natural gas and discovering that there was something
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like an 85 per cent import content for that particular issue. I am not singling out gas but I think there is a very high import component, and cost&hyphen;benefit analyses usually pick that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see little of the money that is passing through the hands of these companies or their workers and this industry. There are some exceptions but, generally, they generate few local jobs. Any flow&hyphen;on effect is more likely to take place in large cities or overseas, and fly&hyphen;in/fly&hyphen;out arrangements are becoming more common. That is associated, obviously, with social incohesion as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Direct return for taxpayer dollars includes tax, though there are a number of areas other than diesel where mining companies get various deductions for their activities. For example, exploration is deductible under division 10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as are a whole raft of things classified as capital expenditure. Now we have seen an extension of what is considered to be rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aside from tax, the return to the public is in the form of royalties or resource rents. This is essentially the payment to the public for the resource itself. Taxation is payable on any business but, in the case of mining, the actual resource&mdash;the ore, the mineral&mdash;should not be taken to be free or able to just be picked up. This is an Australian resource: a non&hyphen;renewable resource that needs to be managed. The people of Australia should benefit directly through payment from anyone taking this resource for their private profit, particularly where it is for the private profit of people in other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet royalties and resource rents in Australia are extremely low. One reason we have so much bauxite mining here is that we undercut the royalties recommended by the International Bauxite Association, of which we are a founding member. The IBA recommendation on bauxite was over $10 per tonne for many years while Australia charged less than $1. The IBA was formed to protect bauxite supplying nations from distorting pricing where the price on bauxite and alumina, generally sold by the miners to its own refineries in another nation, were set at an  artificially low rate that seemed to have little
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3824"> bearing on either the cost or value of the final product or the relative cost of transformation of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the profit was being placed on the final product and the intermediate products were being deemed to cost little more than the cost of actual extraction. Prices were, at times, claimed to be so low that companies like Alcoa in Western Australia have gone for years claiming losses and so paying no tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not repeat any more of the general arguments for eliminating the rebate for mining save to say there are already vast amounts of minerals that have been extracted and processed to varying degrees. What we need now is the will to reduce use, and to develop reuse and recycling technologies. Giving subsidies to mining is not the way to do that. In short, mining is not an area which has provided a high level of return on the subsidies we give. I believe it is time to stop paying people to dig up our resources and send them away. I believe it is also time to abandon the mentality of digging up resources then throwing them away. I commend my amendments to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to add that the Senate on a number of occasions has heard me mention a report that was completed by the department of the environment in relation to environmental economics. They looked at all areas except mining. There was a glib or throwaway line that the reason mining was not included in relation to subsidies&mdash;monetary or environmental&mdash;that taxpayers end up paying various industries in resource extraction was that so much work had been done already. I do not thoroughly believe that explanation. The reason I do not believe it is it is such a big area; it is such a big industry; and it is such a powerful lobbying industry. It is well overdue that governments bite the proverbial bullet and look at the level of environmental and monetary subsidy that the industry gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found it difficult to get an answer when I have asked departments in Western Australia about the comparative levels between industries of subsidies paid and even comparative levels between industries of effective tax paid. It is time that we looked at that. If we want to have any idea of what
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits we gain from industry and what the impact is of state and federal money that has been put in, then we really have to have some sort of comparative study of, if you like, bang for your buck. If we are going to be honest, we cannot leave mining out of those comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would very much like to see environmental economics put in in relation to mining. But I would like even a straightforward assessment of how much effective tax is paid, how that compares with other industries and also what kind of total tax take or corporate welfare is paid across the sector from the taxpayers' dollar. That would be important for us when making decisions in the future about where our very hard earned taxpayer revenue goes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition can I say we will not be supporting the amendments moved by the Western Australian Greens. Let me in reply clearly put the position of the Australian Labor Party. Senator Margetts concluded her remarks by saying that she would welcome a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of the effect of subsidies going to and from the mining industry as a basis for rational consideration of this industry, its importance and the taxing base in Australia&mdash;or words to that effect. One of the points that I made in my speech on the second reading is that there is no rational examination behind this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has said, the Senate Economics Committee conducted an inquiry into this legislation. It was, indeed, a fulsome inquiry. It adduced a great deal of important and pertinent evidence. As a consequence of that inquiry I lodged 65, I think, questions to the government. One of them was about what study they had done as to the justification of moving as they have in this legislation&mdash;what cost&hyphen;benefit study have they done? I also asked what did they know about the effects on employment of increasing taxes on this industry and what did they know about the effects of increasing taxes on the development
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3825"> of this industry. No such study has been done, is the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we take the point of view that we do is that before you move to extend taxes in a wholesale way, in absolute blatant breach of an election undertaking, there ought to be an obligation to see what the effects of that will be. Certainly, there has been a negotiating process&mdash;and I know the minister will draw that to my attention; and he rightly would. But it is a negotiating process that has been conducted not against the background of information but against the imperative of horse trading of elements of this package. It is the contention of those of us in the Labor Party that such a study should have been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising to me that the Greens Western Australia should place&mdash;as obviously their mandate requires them to&mdash;a great deal of emphasis on the environment, in looking at the environment&hyphen;development conundrum. That is their mandate and their obligation. We in the Labor Party have to weigh in the balance the issues of both. The mining industry is a major export industry for Australia. It is a major economic part of the Australian economy and contributes to the national economic health as well as to employment. Certainly, it is an extractive industry, which means it has certain obvious and direct environmental consequences. We support the mining industry based on there being a rational and cohesive and properly enforced set of environmental regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not say no to the mining industry; we say yes to the mining industry, within that environmental protective framework, including remediating sites after the completion of mining to bring back the native vegetation and habitat. In that way, we believe, you can strike a balance between the interests of the environment, which is an important imperative in our minds, and the economic value of the mining industry for Australia. I just want to get that on the record now so I do not have to keep coming back to this position later in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been said in support of this amendment is that the diesel fuel rebate is a subsidy for mining. But it is not a subsidy for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mining. I draw the attention of the Senate to the evidence given by the industry to the Senate Economics Committee's inquiry on this. The industry volunteered the information&mdash;I do not think they were asked a direct question; and this is the relevant part that I call to mind of that evidence&mdash;that if the government wanted to extract further taxes it would be better for the government to do it by taxing the profits of the industry rather than by taxing the input costs to the industry. That is a quite sensible point of view because by taxing diesel fuel and pushing the cost of production up, you push the price of the final product up. This is a highly competitive international industry. If our prices are too high, we lose and jobs are lost in Australia; and economic consequences flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sales are on price so, if we are competitive, greater volumes of sales are made, bringing greater returns and greater employment consequences. We can tax the profit from that. That can be the avenue for the public to recoup its interests in these activities. That is what the industry itself said, and I commend to honourable senators those comments in the Senate inquiry in which that was given as evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Diesel fuel is an essential ingredient in the conduct of mining operations in remote mining communities. As I said yesterday, diesel fuel is taxed at 31c a litre in Australia. If you compare the cost in Australia of diesel fuel&mdash;as an essential input to production&mdash;to the cost of diesel fuel in other mining countries with which we compete, the cost here is by far and away the highest. I mentioned British Columbia, Chile and Indonesia as examples of major competing countries for Australia in the international minerals market. As a consequence of taxing diesel fuel, our diesel fuel cost is far higher than theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By rebating that tax, you bring our industries back into a more competitive framework. You knock off that 31c and reduce the cost per litre to 28c. That compares to 25c per litre in British Columbia and Canada, 24c per litre in Chile and 21c per litre in Indonesia. We are then competing&mdash;as near as dammit&mdash;on the mythical level playing field in terms of the international market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here is a principle&mdash;that is recognised bipartisanly by governments&mdash;that there ought to be a rebate for that reason. The issue we are quibbling about is the extent of it and what areas should qualify for it. For those reasons, I do not support the amendments moved by Senator Margetts, with the greatest of respect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of the comments from Senator Cook in relation to my amendments. I am afraid Senator Cook was not listening very carefully. I did mention environmental economics, but most of my speech was not about environmental comparisons. It was about the ability to see an industry in terms of its tax take and its benefits. That has not been done. There has not been a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of this proposal by the government, and there has not been a direct comparison&mdash;that I know of&mdash;across sectors of industries, looking at tax takes, benefits, employment per unit, and so on, not just to give a comparison of the impact of changes in isolation&mdash;what does this little change mean in terms of the industry?&mdash;but looking at what the benefits of the whole industry are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I have been involved with in some communities in Western Australia is looking at entire proposals and saying, `What are all the benefits that this proposal brings? Think of every single benefit you can. Even write down the ones the company said&mdash;thousands of jobs, export income and so on. Write them all down. What time schedule is involved&mdash;who gets those benefits and over what time? Then look at all the costs to the company, the government and the community. Write them down. When are these paid&mdash;over what time schedule?' That is a very instructive exercise. I do not see why communities are the only ones having to do these studies&mdash;or, if they are, why we are not seeing them more. This is simply saying that, if we are going to make decisions about where government revenue goes or where it does not get charged, we ought to have some basis for that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Leonora in Western Australia, for instance, there is a fairly substantial
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pancontinental proposal which may be bauxite&mdash;I would have to check. It is going over an extension of about 30 kilometres. If, for whatever costs and benefits, the company goes in, mines and leaves, and the community ends up with large pits at various stages over 30 kilometres&mdash;with the lens effect which that will have on the water system, the fauna and the flora and with impacts from potentially dangerous chemicals in the system&mdash;that is a real cost. It is too expensive for companies to fill in the holes, so they say, `We have given you these new wetlands.' However, that is a real cost which ought to be added into the system. If it is not, we are saying, `The community and the environment have to subsidise this industry', even more than we are subsidising it in this sense. That is what I am saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not just standing up and saying, `I am opposing mining because of the environmental impact.' What I am saying is, if we are making economic decisions about the level of support for the mining industry, we ought to have some basis for making those decisions. That is: what are the total benefits of this industry and to whom do these benefits go? Let us have a look at what benefits there are and over what time span we get them. What are the costs? If it includes tax, let us look at it honestly. Who gets the tax? What levels are, in effect, being paid by these industries? Let us look at the costs. Who is bearing these costs? If, in some instances, a disproportionate amount of cost is being borne by communities and that is not figured into the equation, why is that not figured into the equation? If the costs include long&hyphen;term effects like greenhouse effects, why are these not figured into the equation? Who is going to end up picking up the tab some time later?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the questions I am asking, and they are about as rationalist or rational as you can get. Should we not be making decisions about economic support based on accurate, comparative information? Senator Cook says, `No cost benefits were done on this issue.' I would say very little is done in terms of comparative studies across industries. I know that used to be the case in Western Australia; I do not know if it has improved since then.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3827">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are areas of black holes in relation to industry support. Often we are dependent on what companies say will be the benefits of their proposals. The actual books showing the incomings and outgoings are rarely available for public scrutiny. In Western Australia that scrutiny only happens when companies put their hand out for support. A few years ago at least, only about two or three companies per year had their incomings and outgoings scrutinised by the various state bodies to see how much they warranted the support of the taxpayer in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the issues. I have talked about environmental economics because that is where the big gap is. We have done some studies. I believe departments have done some very useful studies which have looked at the levels of environmental subsidies that are going into resource extraction industries. These are real&mdash;people are paying them in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have left out mining, why? That is my question. I am trying to put some rationality into this argument because people would always like to paint the Greens as just having an emotional response or just having a response based on the environment only. Unfortunately, Senator Cook left out the fact that a lot of what I was talking about was also about employment. If we are saying that we are supporting this because of employment, how does it compare with other industries, and could we be making decisions which actually increase employment a lot more efficiently than what we are doing in relation to our subsidies of the mining industry? Those are the points that I would make; and I wanted to correct that perception, if there was a perception left at the end of Senator Cook's contribution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be supporting the Greens' amendments. I want to make a few points; and I do not want to delay the committee too much.

There have been studies done&mdash;you can localise them if you wish, and I will touch on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one in a minute. The mining industry has the greatest investment potential in this country. It is the greatest contributor to export income: 60 per cent of all our merchandise export is in the mining industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts mentioned gas. There is a lot of government revenue coming from gas apart from company profits. There is also the secondary taxation regime. You are probably aware, Senator, that some of the companies are suggesting that, when we go out into deeper waters, we should have another look at the secondary tax regime because we need to be competitive compared with other parts of the world. We believe our regime is competitive with the rest of the world but there are places where we are a little bit less competitive&mdash;one is the Gulf of Mexico and another is the North Sea off Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must also consider the spin&hyphen;off downstream effects. One of the things that I think we all want in this country&mdash;this is something that I pursued even before I came into this place&mdash;is more downstream processing. Because of the gas developments in Western Australia, we are now seeing a growth in the downstream processing of resources in respect of which this country is inherently wealthy. One factor is that we are blessed with lots of gas and another is that the very fortunate state of Western Australia is blessed with lots of iron ore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day before yesterday, I participated with the Vice&hyphen;Premier of China in the signing of two letters of intent with two companies involved in Western Australia in the direct reduction of iron ore. Whether those projects go ahead will depend on feasibility studies and a range of things like that. But it is in the interests of everyone that those projects involving companies in the resource industry do go ahead. Gas is now stimulating downstream processing, which was not there before, and that brings with it a whole lot of other things that are counted into the equation&mdash;the infrastructure development that would not normally occur and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You argue that, from a mining industry point of view, direct employment is not so large. No&hyphen;one disagrees with that; it is very much a capital intensive industry. But the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3828"> multiplier effects of the mining industry are huge. Conservatively, the figure is often given as four to one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, let me go back to the diesel fuel rebate. It is just wrong to use the word `subsidy'. It is not truthful. The mining industry and the farming industry pay excise on diesel. Because they are diesel dependent, because they are our major export earning areas, because we must remain competitive and because they have no other option in the main, they get a diesel fuel rebate for work directly related to the mining and farming industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry does not get the full rebate of the excise it pays. My recollection is that they get 90 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will debate it, Mr Temporary Chairman. I would like to point out a couple of things about what the minister said. First of all, the minister referred to the multiplier effect. Whenever you find that an industry is having trouble justifying its claim that it lives, works and profits in the interests of job creation in the country, you will find that they resort to the multiplier number&mdash;pick a number out of the air, make it two, five or 10, it does not matter, and claim that that is the basis for the number of jobs that the industry supports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economists have for at least a decade been debunking that multiplier wish list as being insupportable. If you added up all the multipliers for all the industries in Australia, you would probably find that 10 times the number of workers are claimed to be supported by industry in Australia as there are workers in the work force. We have to look at the direct number of people employed. As the minister correctly indicated, the mining industry is, relatively speaking, job poor. Its aim is to downsize, to rationalise and to get rid of as many workers as possible. There is pretty clear incentive to do that because the fewer people you have on the payroll the more profits you make for the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest of the mining corporations is, sensibly, to maximise the profit being returned to the shareholders. If there is one quicker way to reach that profitability than getting rid of workers it is to reach into the government coffers. That is what this diesel fuel rebate is about. It is about returning taxes that ought to be kept in the government coffers for the benefit of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook said, `Let us not get rid of this scheme. If we have to get a better return for the people from the mineral resources industries, let us tax profit.' I have no doubt that the mining corporations would stand by that philosophy because they are multinational
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3829"> corporations very often and they are big on transfer pricing. They know how to manipulate prices between countries so that they can where necessary minimise the profitability of their operations in one country to avoid taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to tax profitability you could look at the Savage River iron ore mine in Tasmania, established in 1965. It drove a pipeline through the rainforests of the Tarkine to Port Latter on the north coast, from where the iron ore has been exported to the northern hemisphere and, under the doyen of Labor politics for that decade, Eric Reece, paid no royalties whatever&mdash;not a cent. In latter years it paid minimal royalties, not least because the Greens were trying, in the Labor-Green accord period, to get the mining industry to pay a fair dollar for the rich mineral loads it was exploiting in Tasmania. But even then transfer pricing came into it. Whenever the Savage River mines looked like they were going to make a profit because world prices were up, they would send a letter to the owners in Asia saying,`We need to increase the cost of the iron ore we are sending to you for processing.' The price would go up, the profit would drop and profitability would mysteriously not increase according to world prices. The reverse also occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of international corporations to engage in transfer pricing is only one of the factors that allows them to get around paying a fair return to this country for the resources being extracted. These resources belong to the people of this country.

The reason is that the mining companies manage to manipulate their profitability or to get out of paying a fair return to the Tasmanian exchequer simply through their ability to frighten weak-kneed politicians against increasing the royalties. In Tasmania in most years, through the 1980s at least, the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are having part of this debate today because of the kinds of statements the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) is making. He mentions companies that are diesel dependent. The government has made changes which make rail options more expensive. If anything, the government is creating a greater diesel dependency by companies and then handing them something back for that. If the government had some realistic desire to make companies less diesel dependent, it would take the options available which might benefit the environment, but it has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A gold rush mentality does exist within this government. It existed to a certain extent with the previous government as well but even more so with this one. The gold rush mentality was based on the fact that when people originally populated certain parts of Australia they brought their savings, they worked and there was at that stage a very high multiplier effect which was measurable because there was not anything in those areas before. We are talking about towns being built and areas that changed as a result of mining. Whether that multiplier effect actually benefited the country is another debate altogether. The gold rush mentality is being maintained, but it is a totally different ball game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister mentioned $600 million in export income. The kinds of studies I am talking about question how much of that, say, $600 million, benefits the country that is hosting this event, how much are we being benefited in terms of things like taxation, how much stays in the country, how much is repatriated as profit repatriation and how much do we benefit if there is a very high import content. So throwing around figures like $600 million is almost meaningless. It is not our export income; it is the export income of a particular company.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3832">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless you are prepared to look further into what those figures mean&mdash;that is, to whom, how and over what time export income is distributed&mdash;those figures are meaningless. They are the kinds of figures that always make the front page of the business pages but are rarely looked at more closely because of the kind of issue that Senator Brown spoke about&mdash;the business lunches, which end up being free promotions in the business pages or the front pages of newspapers and which are often uncritical about the figures behind the figures because those figures are generally not available. The companies are not going to make them available, and governments rarely have access to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of throwing statements around like `this will benefit us by $600 million', we need to find out exactly how much will benefit us. We need to look at the cost and the actual incomings and outgoings for whom and over what time. Six hundred million dollars means nothing if very little of that stays to benefit Australia but in particular the local communities who end up with, say, 30 kilometres of great, whacking lens effect pits that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is time I entered the debate, if I may. There are, Minister, sound environmental, economic and fiscal reasons for supporting a major reduction in the diesel fuel rebate. The government has chosen only one of those. It has chosen the fiscal reason. The Australian Democrats had recommended as a first step that $400 million worth of reduction should be applied on a graduated basis to the mining industry's diesel fuel rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this bill, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 (No.2), the government has delivered $160 million worth of cuts, which is about 40 per cent of the Democrats' target. The Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has clearly made the point to Senators Brown and Margetts that that cut at least accords with their objectives and for that reason he seeks their support for the bill, if for no other reason. It is for that reason, of course, that the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Democrats do support the bill&mdash;because we do believe that there are sound reasons for reducing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Senators Margetts, Cook and Brown have focused much more on the economic and environmental arguments whereas the government's arguments, not particularly well elucidated today but previously elucidated, are primarily fiscal. Although I understand the government's frustration at the delays, it is quite proper for this debate to take place because it is about a fundamental policy issue, a fundamental policy direction and a fundamental disagreement about where economic and taxation policy should go in terms of trying to marry the environmental, economic, fiscal and, I guess we should add, social components that are affected by this very large subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have had three prime motivations&mdash;I outlined them fully in my speech in the second reading debate; I will not repeat all of what I said&mdash;for our belief that the diesel fuel rebate should be reduced. Firstly, we do believe that the mining industry has the capacity to substantially improve fuel efficiency by reducing its reliance on diesel&mdash;a move that would assist in reducing Australia's greenhouse emissions. It is our objective to reduce the use of diesel and to use other renewable or preferable energy sources. That has a sound environmental basis, and that is one the minister and this government well understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have accepted the fiscal argument that there are limits to the budget capacity of government and, in a climate of strong budget cuts and competing demands from society for expenditure in other areas that it considers more important, it is appropriate for both the government and the other parties in the parliamentary process to debate where those moneys are spent. Once again, it is for that reason that we support your cuts, because we think that $160 million is better spent elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, and it really comes to the nub of the economic argument, we believe that the diesel fuel rebate is an inefficient and inappropriate industry and export motivator. All sides recognise that it is a selective motivator.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3833"> They recognise that it is discriminatory between types of mining and so on. That is a judgment you have to make on budgetary grounds, because if it was open&hyphen;ended the cost would be horrendous. We understand your motivation but we do not accept the choices you have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of our great difficulties with this. The arguments of Senator Cook could equally apply to all those mining operations&mdash;and there are many&mdash;that do not benefit from the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It could apply to manufacturing, which does not benefit from the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Manufacturing has the same need to keep down input costs, the same need to keep down its sale price, the same need to have an industry motivator as any other industry. It certainly applies to the rail industry, which both this government and the previous government have operated a prejudicial policy towards, and it does apply to many exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have an interventionist view on industry policy. We do have an interventionist view about the use of economic measures to motivate particular industries and particular sectors. We say to you that this particular motivator is an inefficient and inappropriate industry measure. We do consider it, Minister&mdash;and you understand our argument, as we understand yours&mdash;to be an industry assistance measure because it is discriminatory. If it was an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board tax measure it would not be discriminatory. It is that fundamental discrimination which distinguishes it from a tax rebate device and makes it in fact a specific industry support mechanism. If you look behind the arguments of Senator Margetts and Senator Brown, that is also what they are saying, that this is a device which has been used to single out favourably certain industry sectors. The question is: is that appropriate, is that right, is it going into the right hands and is it having the right consequences? I think the questions that have been asked deserve to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that remark I have made comes my problem with Senator Margetts's amendment. Senator Margetts seeks to knock out this DFR within two years. Whilst I and my party have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very broad and very deep sympathy with that policy intention, this is too far and too fast. It would be very difficult for me, who has stood now in countless estimates hearings and committee hearings and industry hearings where I have consistently argued against government cuts on the basis that they have not been done in terms of the evaluation of their effect on investment, jobs, exports and growth, then to accept an amendment which also comes to us without an equivalent assessment of the effects of a very fast reduction of the DFR on investment, jobs, exports and growth. It is very difficult. I think Senator Margetts asked the right questions, but those studies actually need to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the coin is this: no&hyphen;one on my side of the house is against the mining industry in any sense. We recognise both its benefits and its down sides. But we also recognise that the economic reality and the financial and accounting reality is this. Minister, I think your experience would cause you to agree; I can only outline it in terms of my reading. My reading is that, generally speaking, mining investment projects have a period of between eight and 15 years before you get a return. In other words, it is a long&hyphen;term investment of a very high capital nature and there is a significant lag before you get your return. If the diesel fuel rebate is such that it provides an important financial and cash flow mechanism that has been built into the assessments of those who have invested in the industry, it would not behove us as parliamentarians to suddenly say, `Hey, we are going to whip this out from you in two years' if it is built into, say, an eight&hyphen;year return mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a second reason that I regard Senator Margetts's amendments, unfortunately, as going too far and too fast. But I would like to put parliament on notice and for you to understand that we will continue to give strong support to reappraisal of the scheme. We believe that, first of all, it should be capped. We do believe that it should be turned away from an excise rebate to an assistance measure. We would prefer that to be dedicated to those mining operations which are more environmentally friendly than others,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3834"> such as natural gas. We have the opinion that you do need a graduated and phased reduction of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know you are short of money, because you keep telling us the importance of fiscal responsibility, and we would urge the government to continue the reduction. In the arguments of Senator Margetts and Senator Brown, if you take away some of those things that make you react strongly but if you listen to the questions and the motivation, and if you listen to my own arguments, you will find some good policy reasons for refining and reducing and changing the nature of the scheme. Accordingly, Minister, although I regret that I cannot support Senator Margetts's amendment at this time, I would urge you and your government to respond to the intention and the thoughts that lie behind it.</PARA></SPEECH>

We cannot find $650 million for the universities, but we can find $800 million for the mining corporations. That, to me, is a shocking inversion of priorities.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) are a very constructive and positive initiative to establish a sun fund. In short, it means that those people who are currently receiving the diesel fuel rebate for the production of electricity can apply for a capital grant, in lieu of that rebate, to establish sun&hyphen;produced energy&mdash;that includes wind energy and photovol taic cells&mdash;and clean, green energy on their farms or in their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, what would happen is that the applicant who wants to replace his or her diesel generator, which produces electricity for the home farm, for example, or the machinery shed, would apply to the fund for 10 years worth of diesel fuel rebate to finance the establishment of the new energy alternative&mdash;solar panels, solar hot water system, wind energy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3837">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are terrific advantages to this. It is cost neutral to the government. It is optional to the farmer, or indeed the miner. It has the fantastic potential to stimulate the alternative energy industry in Australia, as the world moves into a huge expansion in this industry with new technology coming in almost month by month and as the world moves away from the age of fossil fuel exploitation to the age of a sun powered future. Australia has the image which will allow its industries not only to tap the domestic market, but feed into the burgeoning market for alternative energy options, particularly those that can be applied locally in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, as well as around the rest of the world, including Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to reiterate that this is an antidote to the unfathomable decision by the government to cut funding for energy efficiency by 50 per cent in the recent budget&mdash;that is its own spending on that&mdash;as well to reduce all funding for the Energy Research and Development Corporation, which was the only government funded entity in Australia putting money into ensuring that we led the world in this exciting field which has such terrific economic and environmental spin-offs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as this fund is concerned, we are not talking about small pickles. As I said in the second reading debate, we are talking about a potential 600 megawatt replacement of diesel fuel electricity production by sun powered alternatives. Six hundred megawatts is the equivalent of half an average thermal power station in the mainland states or half the total output of Tasmania's 39 Hydro Electric Commission dams. It is the equivalent of more than three Franklin dams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a market that is potentially an enormous stimulus to the alternative energy industries in this country. Here we have a means of win, win, win for Australia. It is clear that this diesel fuel rebate is an established part of political thinking in this country. It is supported by the four bigger parties in this parliament. Here we have an alternative which I think all parties should very seriously consider and give affirmation to as well, because we are looking here at Australia being given a boost at no cost to the government and at an option for those people who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are getting the diesel fuel rebate who want to take it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in submitting to the committee that we adopt this amendment, I must point to the greenhouse gas and global warming phenomenon itself. This amendment, in the full flowering of its potential, could reduce by one per cent or so the huge contribution to national greenhouse gas production of the electricity industry. In other words, it makes a sizeable contribution towards our national obligation to join the rest of the world in reducing the production of greenhouse gases and therefore the threat of global warming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything is positive about this option. So often the Greens get labelled as being negative, obstructionist and oppositional. Here is a great opportunity for the government in particular to show a positive response to a great idea that is a winner not only for the environment but for farmers, miners and business, particularly small business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wholeheartedly recommend this amendment to the committee and I finally want to read out a letter which my office received yesterday from BP Solar. The manager of renewable power systems there, Richard Collins, had this to say about this sun fund:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the media release regarding the sun fund. The concept as outlined in the release is certainly worthy of support from BP Solar's point of view. Not only will the funds assist in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but they will also provide and excellent base business for Australian companies working in the renewable energy sectors with obvious benefits in employment throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These new energy systems have doubled the direct employment potential of the old fossil  fuel energy production systems. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For your interest, the accompanying sheets show our predictions of carbon dioxide savings on the assumption that half the $85 million goes to photovoltaics to displace diesel generation. This assumes increased production of 7.45 megawatts of solar cells.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there we have very easy support for this motion from a representative of a major corporation who is in the business of energy alternatives. This is a major corporation, by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3838"> the way, which has international connections and which is part of BP's recognition that the future is not fossil; the future is solar. So I commend this proposal to the committee, to the Senate and to this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.22 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say that the Greens (WA) will support the amendments of Senator Brown and welcome them. I have been calling for a program to address the need for capital inputs into conversion to renewable power sources for years in relation to the diesel rebates, to greenhouse and to energy privatisation and in estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of diesel rebate for electricity generation has always been problematic for the Greens (WA) since we strongly believe that diesel is a poor source of energy for power generation in rural Australia. From our perspective, this includes both those with stand&hyphen;alone electricity generating systems and those townships with mini reticulated state power from large diesel generators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of carting diesel to these remote locations is added to the tragedy of burning petroleum, a non-renewable resource with a high intrinsic value as a high thermal substance liquid at normal temperature and pressure. It has further added to the stupidity or failure to develop the massive resources we in Australia have in terms of renewable energy. At the same time, we are loath to penalise rural people for living in these areas and do not believe they should suffer for the lack of imagination of government or for the lack of resources to overcome the high up&hyphen;front capital barriers to renewables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also said that the subsidy of pollution and resource waste through a diesel rebate or through cross&hyphen;subsidised state power based on diesel was ludicrous. We would like to remove it, but would not do so without a program for assisting rural people to attain renewable alternatives. People would remember such things as the light fuel oil debates when the Greens were standing up and fighting for rural and remote regional communities in terms of fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program put forward by Senator Brown is actually quite modest. It does not refer to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rural diesel town power except for mining towns. It does not provide money for the full amount of the RAP system. It ties the money available in the total fund to the amount currently given to electricity generation, and it ties what can be obtained to the previous levels of diesel rebate that were obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some questions I would like to ask. There has not been mention of other sources of power, such as wave and tidal power. What was the basis of that? I ask that because, as with renewable energy technologies and often with technology generally, the commercial availability may follow as a result of allowing such things under a program.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.25 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just respond to Senator Margetts. Yes, it is a very modest scheme, but I guess that is a big incentive for government to get behind it. It is not radical by any means. It is based on available technology. It has the simplicity of being cost neutral, and it is optional for those people getting the diesel fuel rebate. So it is a very enticing scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts is right: it does not specifically pick up on options such as wave and tidal power, which are amongst the solar options for the future&mdash;and I guess there is a component of lunar energy involved in tidal power. But I would look to this idea being expanded upon in the future and being made available to communities such as non-mining communities, including Aboriginal communities in the bush, and communities in the bush where there are state funded diesel generation schemes at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we look at those, but they will involve actual money coming out of a government allocation of specific money. The beauty of this scheme is that it is not going to involve the government in paying out more money than it pays out in the diesel fuel rebate option. So, yes, it is modest, but that makes it all the more attractive, I would think, to a government which is looking to get behind the energy options of the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3839"> been promoting renewable energy sources and environmentally friendly renewable sources in the 20 years of our parliamentary career. We have, as you know, an extremely strong environmental cause at the heart of our party's intentions. What Senator Brown is proposing in this rather nicely phrased `sun fund' is not only a very attractive idea emotionally and conceptually but also a practical idea. It is an idea whereby the sun fund would encourage people to switch from using diesel fuel to using renewable energy sources for generating electricity. Obviously that has to be cost-efficient for those people who wish to use it. It intends to promote photovoltaic, wind or solar systems of energy use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I say it is worthy of your consideration and is practical is that Australia is still a leader in environmental energy use and development. This is not new technology. It is not futurist technology. It is now technology. It has been found to be both environmentally and economically sound and productive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief debate we are going to have on this particular amendment, we should give some credit where credit is due to all those Liberal and Labor governments who have assisted in the development so far of alternative and renewable energy sources. Of course, we should give credit to those business organisations who have developed these into practical and economically useful alternative energy means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this proposal is saying is, `This government needs to go much further in this area and here is one idea for you to consider.' However, I would like to conclude my and my party's strong support for this idea and the amendments with a criticism&mdash;if I may&mdash;of Senator Brown in terms of the process. This is a major initiative which deserved to be lobbied and promoted far better than it was. I have had carriage of this bill for six months. I am advised that this proposal was sent to our environmental spokesperson, Senator Meg Lees, a week ago. She got it&mdash;she tells me&mdash;the same day I did, which was yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the difficulties you have as a single senator but we would have done well, given the nature of the Senate, to have pro
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moted the idea far more vigorously with both Labor and the Independent Senator Harradine to get their support for it. I do not know how Senator Cook or Senator Harradine are going to respond. Because it is such a valuable initiative I would have liked to have seen it given a really good go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend you for your sun fund. I commend you for the very well&hyphen;phrased name. I commend the idea to the government for their consideration. If they reject it I would urge them to consider it as a possible policy option for them in the future. I indicate the Democrats' full support for this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on record the Labor Party's attitude to this amendment. I share many of the reservations that have just been put by Senator Murray. This is a significant initiative but it is not appropriate that it come up under this bill. This is not the home for it. This is a bill about a rebate on diesel fuel: the amendment is about a fund to promote alternative energy sources. That is not to say the amendment lacks merit: it is to say it is inappropriately placed under this legislation. My first reservation is that, if the promoters of this sun fund are sincere, I would have expected a private member's bill and an opportunity to draw support in behind it. It is a question of us being able to look at the detail of it and to analyse the implications that flow from that rather than what might be termed colloquially as an `ambush' at the 11th hour on a piece of legislation that has been before us since February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reservations. I think that sincerity of purpose is in part shown not only by the quality of the ideas and the initiative but also by the process that is undertaken to introduce a new measure. This may be seen by some as  a stunt and nothing more because it has not been properly developed. However, I do not wish to be negative about positive initiatives. Irrespective of our disquiet about the lateness of it, the lack of consultation about it, the non&hyphen;indication over the last several months in which this bill has been before us of any interest about this type of initiative or the inappropriateness of this legislation being a vehicle to house this initiative, one ought to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3840"> turn one's attention to the merit of the proposal as well. All the foregoing is to put my reservations, through the chair, to Senator Brown about how we approach this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the merit side, in principle I can understand and support the idea. It seems to me what is being promoted here is an opportunity for people who are recipients of the diesel fuel rebate to cash out their rebate in order that they then invest the proceeds into alternative energy sources that are renewable. This would mean that, while they would never be a claimant again on the rebate, they would meet their energy needs. In fact, they would probably cease to be a user of diesel fuel. If I understand the initiative clearly, there is nothing in that that I find offensive. In some respects I find it imaginative. Since it is optional, it is for the individual corporation or body to make the decision to elect to go this way or not to elect to go this way. That is, as I understand, your proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not had sufficient time to consider it, nor have I had sufficient time to work through how it might apply in practice. Having been in this chamber for many years I have seen many proposals that have come forward that superficially are appealing but when you try to impose them in practice you come up against those unforeseen difficulties that bite you and that can create bigger problems. You may think you are solving a simple problem but you then find out you have created other bigger problems and more illegalities or illogicalities in the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I say from the outset that this government very much supports the renewable energy industry. It is an industry that has become very mature; it is an industry that, if you exclude hydro, is now worth about $250 million a year to Australia&mdash;$100 million of which is export income; the other $150 million is domestic. As Senator Murray indicated we are recognised&mdash;and I found this when I was in Indonesia last year&mdash;as being one of the leaders in the world in the photovoltaic area. There is a market out there in remote areas. Generally, the view of the industry is that it is not photovoltaic cells on their own; it is hybrid systems that are being used in remote areas&mdash;and for cost&hyphen;effective reasons, I might say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are always open to any new and imaginative ideas that might promote this industry, because it does have a market. We have not had the opportunity to look at it in a lot of detail&mdash;and for this reason, we will not be supporting the amendment&mdash;but I think there is a flaw, Senator Brown, in your argument that it would be cost neutral to the government. The flaw is that it ignores the fact that for the diesel fuel rebate to be paid, diesel excise must be paid by the person who receives the diesel fuel rebate. For example, just taking a figure out of the air, if people who wanted to convert were paying somewhere in the order of $100 million and getting the diesel fuel rebate, they would have already paid the excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going down the track of saying what would happen if they decided to switch, but in most cases it would not happen unless they were using it just for home lighting and kitchen utensils. If they were into other things, like farmers, for example, using shearing sheds or those running airconditioning&mdash;or any of those things with a heavy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3841"> usage of electricity&mdash;they would be using a hybrid system with a diesel back&hyphen;up. The diesel back&hyphen;up would be required in most cases for the days when you could not store the required power in the batteries for photovoltaics. I think it sounds interesting. It probably needs a lot more development and on the face of it there does seem a flaw in the economic argument. You get the diesel fuel rebate only if you pay the diesel excise in the first place.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think one of the recommendations of Senator Cook was for Senator Brown to pursue it and, if necessary, bring in a private member's bill so it can be studied by everyone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very interested in having this amendment meet success. It is a very exciting and positive innovation. First of all, let me explain to the committee that, while the diesel fuel excise has been a matter of debate for some months, it is only in the last week or two that this idea came forward of putting some of this money to such positive alternative use as an option for those people who get the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;in the bush in the main.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Murray indicated, the Greens have the least staff and the least ability to rapidly flesh out all the intricacies of such a measure. That said, I want to pay tribute to Margaret Blakers in my office, who has been working flat out on this proposal and from whom the proposal comes. I am very much attracted to the proposal Senator Cook puts forward that we have an adjournment while this is looked at by all parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the only option available to me. I will tell you why. The private member's option, as you know, is not a real one. I have been here long enough to know that a private member's bill coming from me will never get up for debate. I have two private member's  bills listed from last year. There is no chance that they will be debated this year. The Andrews bill against euthanasia laws in the Northern Territory was an exception which had the power of a goodly number of senators&mdash;including government senators&mdash;behind it. I am not in that situation. So the middle
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3842"> ground there for me, while I would like to see this voted on and supported now, is to accommodate the real concerns I can see that Senator Cook, Senator Murray and Senator Harradine have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After such a long time, I would think it is not going to make a huge difference if we have a delay of a week or two while this matter is looked at thoroughly. I am confident that it will be found to be every bit the good idea that I put to this committee. I would see it being knocked out of debate now as a thumbs down, and I cannot see how I can bring it back into the Senate with a chance of success. It is a terrific idea, and the option should be given to both the industry and the diesel fuel recipients themselves to give feedback on the idea. A brief delay, while we get that feedback and while the figures are looked at, is a responsible way of going, and I would support it.</PARA>

I am saying that it is estimated that the cost of this would be $85 million per annum, and that there is a cap on the amount that can go into this scheme.

On estimates I have, a farm with a moderate sized home and machinery could be supplied with a two&hyphen;kilowatt system, attracting a grant of about $7,500. Over a 10-year period a farmer converting to photovoltaics would be $5,000 better off than staying with diesel. A site that was economic for wind power could be $18,000 better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is such an attractive option. I would like to see, if there is not immediate support for this option now, that we at least put the onus on the government to come back to the Senate and point out where the problems are. I do not think they are there. I have given that assurance to the committee as I see it. I would like to see this supported. I am happy to make that amendment. I put it to the opposition that the onus should now be on the government, if it feels negative about this sun fund, to come back to us and say why, to come back and explain why we should not take this option up rather than to effectively shelve it outside this opportunity here and now to make it work.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, these amendments&mdash;I will be brief because either the Senate agrees or it does not&mdash;arise from my concern which arose from a question which was put to you in October 1996 at question time. That related to a problem of a major leakage and loss of diesel
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fuel at a mining site, which was subsequently claimed for the diesel fuel rebate. The minister's answer to the question&mdash;it has provoked these amendments&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that it is not possible to determine whether all or part of the diesel lost was, or was not, subject to a rebate claim without an extensive search of both Customs and GEMCO's records, even then, a conclusive outcome may not result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . under the existing legislation, payment of rebate is based on intended use for eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I said in the hearings and I have said in my reports and in my various speeches that it struck me as extremely odd that a claim should be made for intended, not actual, use, particularly when it runs to multimillions and may occur at a number of sites and in a number of instances during a normal financial year. This is particularly so since there may be an aspect of double-dipping here, because I understand that when fuel is lost the company concerned may claim against insurance for that. Whilst not dipping against government, they are getting a nice little handout from insurance and a nice little handout from the government as well.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw your attention to our amendment 164(a). From a practical point of view, people buy fuel and it goes into very remote places, they claim the rebate and then they must justify that it was used for eligible purposes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the bill. Basically, it says that if anyone makes an application for the diesel fuel rebate and sells or otherwise disposes of it or uses it in a manner other than indicated in the application or it loses the fuel, whether by accident, theft or any other known reason, they must, within 21 days after disposal or 21 days after loss, give particulars in writing of the sale and so on or the loss. Hence they will not attract the diesel fuel rebate. If they have got it, they will have to pay it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that covers it without the complications of saying that you do not claim for it until you use it, because there could be people in the farming industry and in the mining industry who might have accumulations of fuel over long periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make is that the very thing you raised&mdash;that question, in fact, was a very good question in October&mdash;related to the mine up in the Northern Territory where the fuel was lost over a period of, I think, 10 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is the Australian Democrats' amendments limit claims for the rebate to diesel that has been used as opposed to fuel purchased with the intent to use it for an eligible purpose. We have some reservations about this, given that it includes farmers and residential power users, hospitals, nursing homes, perhaps Silver Chain units and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> homes for the aged. It could be problematic in relation to subsection 164(3) of the Customs Act, which states that a collector can refuse to consider an application for rebate if the amount is for less than 2,000 litres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers and residential power users who buy in bulk and pay full price may not use the diesel for up to a year. It is also not so uncommon to borrow for major capital expenses such as a year's supply of fuel. We need to remember that the cost of transporting a number of drums of fuel or getting a tanker out to a remote site to fill tanks is not inconsiderable. We therefore are asking mainly farmers in remote residences to carry the debt for up to a year until they can apply for the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hospitals and other medical establishments may be remote, but even urban institutions buy fuel for their emergency generators, which are necessary to maintain power should grid power fail for any reason. Urban hospitals in particular may not use the fuel for some time since use is mainly dependent on power failures or shortages.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, item 23, page 11 (lines 27 to 31), omit subsection (7B).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think amendment No. 13 is self-explanatory, but perhaps I can just say that this amendment under the opposition list of amendments is to omit subsection (7B) after subsection 164(7). We wish to omit the provision that says that, if common salt is washed as part of a process of beneficiating that salt, then for the purpose of paragraph (7)(a) beneficiation of the salt ceases when the salt is deposited in a stockpile immediately after the washing process or if there is more than one washing process after the initial process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why we wish to omit this provision is that this matter was canvassed extensively at the hearing and this is the area where Dampier Salt would be declined rebate. Dampier Salt fought a case which went to the High Court on appeal by the customs officers. The High Court finally declined to deal with it. However, the Federal Court, the last court of appeal, had ruled that Dampier Salt was entitled to claim the rebate. Dampier Salt's entitlement was traded off in high&hyphen;level negotiations with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Western Australia, Dampier Salt is a substantial company. It is an export company. It engages in what the Federal Court had held to be a mining operation for which it was entitled to a rebate. It seems to me inappropriate and wrong for what the court upheld to be now put aside by this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I think the situation which CRA, the holding company of Dampier Salt, faced was one in which the government said, `You have got to find these savings and find some trade&hyphen;offs or you will risk losing the lot,' and in those circumstances CRA sacrificed the Dampier Salt situation and that company in order to defend their interests in the wider mining area. I just do not think that is an appropriate imposition on Dampier Salt. The cost of Dampier Salt having to pay the full
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diesel fuel excise would be $800,000 a year. This is a marginal operation, and that will compute into competitiveness and jobs in that region. For those reasons we have so moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Cook that this was pretty well canvassed in the Economics Legislation Committee. But I just say that this was part of the agreement between the industry and the government. The purpose of it was to address the precedent set in the Dampier Salt case. It was the view of Customs that there could be flow&hyphen;on effects where people could then apply for diesel fuel rebate where they did not receive it in the past. This would have gone against the intent of the diesel fuel rebate and could well have been a cost to revenue. I think Customs estimated the figure to be in the order of $100 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, firstly, it was an agreement reached with the industry. Secondly, it was there to do the very thing we had discussions with the industry about, and that was to stop the exponential growth occurring in the diesel fuel rebate in ways for which it was never intended. That was a major concession by the industry to chop off the exponential growth.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments from the opposition relate to salt, as does opposition amendment No. 15. Fundamentally, if things are either included or excluded from the rebate on an arbitrary basis, which we argue, salt production is included. But, if we are going to include it, it seems somewhat superfluous and illogical to say that salt production attracts a rebate but then say that taking it through to the final value added phase of beneficiation is not included. Most beneficiation involves a preparation of minerals to a form which is marketable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no substantial market for dirty salt, as there is little market for low grade ore. There is a substantial value adding in the process of washing salt and a substantial market for clean salt. The government, in an effort to justify cutting out the second washing of salt, has created an amendment that says that no regard is to be had to any market considerations. What does that mean? There
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3849"> is a market for bauxite and a market for alumina. In fact, bauxite is exported from Weipa while WA aluminium ores are almost all exported as alumina. This is a market consideration, since there is clearly a market for both. But the Weipa bauxites run to a tonne of alumina per two tonnes of bauxite and the WA alumina runs to a tonne of alumina to three tonnes of bauxite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason it is processed to alumina is in large part because the ore is of low grade and it is cheaper to remove the two tonnes of red mud from the tonne of alumina before you ship it. In addition, Weipa exports bauxite because there are other refineries for conversion of bauxite to alumina much nearer than for the producers of bauxite in south&hyphen;west WA other than the ones they have built for themselves. There is also the ready availability of power and infrastructure for refining which is available in WA and not in Weipa, which is another market consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conversion or non&hyphen;conversion of bauxite to alumina is almost solely a market decision. Is it therefore the case that such a conversion is not a beneficiation? The point is that almost any beneficiation has regard to market considerations. A purer form of a substance is nearly always more valuable but various market considerations&mdash;transport distance, labour costs, available infrastructure, tax regimes which differ from nation to nation&mdash;are all commercial considerations which affect whether beneficiation is done here or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A purer form of substance may also have other uses. Clean sea salt is different from unwashed salt and has different uses. High purity silica has different properties and can be converted to special ceramic products like bearings and hip joints. High purity silica is not a final product, and I would like to think that the process of producing it is beneficiation. On the lack of logic of the government's approach, I would like to say that the Greens (WA) will be supporting the opposition's amendment in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an amendment to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), and it relates to the operation of fishing vessels. I have put this amendment deliberately, Minister, to flesh out some difficult questions which I think are worthy of debate and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greater information. I recognise some of the difficulties that we are faced with with such an amendment, and I look forward to your response accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the eligibility of overseas owned fishing boats to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Excise is not payable on fuel or any other item which is exported. Hence a foreign ship or aircraft which takes fuel on board in Australia and continues an international journey is deemed to be exporting fuel, so it is not required to pay excise. Had excise been paid for some reason, the purchaser would be entitled to a rebate on any excise paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an entirely separate arrangement from that applying under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The amount refunded under that scheme is slightly different from the amount of excise collected. The excise, as I understand it, is currently 34.697c per litre, while the rebate is 34.582c per litre. Hence there is a slightly different result for those exempt from the excise compared with those eligible for the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In that respect, we must recognise that there is a clear difference in the intention of those two provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone eligible for the diesel fuel rebate must first pay the excise and then apply to receive the refund. Ships continuing an international voyage can purchase excise free fuel held in depots in bond at ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diesel fuel rebate is payable in respect of a boat which fishes in Australian waters. To me, that is equivalent to a company working on the land and in Australia. The legislation does not discriminate between Australian and foreign owned fishing boats. So long as the boat carries on a fishing activity, it is eligible to receive the rebate. A boat which carries out fishing in Australian waters would not be treated as exporting the fuel it purchases in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter was brought to my attention by an article written by Nick Cater on Friday, 31 January 1997. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese fishermen operating in Australian waters are receiving Federal Government subsidies on diesel fuel.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3851">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operators of up to 250 foreign&hyphen;registered fishing vessels a year are able to exploit a loophole in the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme giving 25c back on each litre of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme was originally introduced to provide relief for struggling Australian farmers who use diesel for off&hyphen;road vehicles and machinery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But fishing operators have discovered they too can claim excise rebates on fuel intended for "off road" purposes, regardless of their nationality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An inquiry by the Australian National Audit Office last year highlighted widespread problems with the scheme including foreign fishing vessels claiming rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, 250 Japanese long&hyphen;line vessels were licensed to catch up to 3.2 million kilograms of tuna, marlin, shark and other fish in Australian waters. At least 84 vessels took up the option to operate out of Sydney, Hobart and Fremantle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">About $91 million was paid to fishing vessel operators under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme last financial year. . . Proposed changes to the scheme introduced to Parliament last month will make it harder for some mining operators to claim rebates. But the changes will not affect fishing boat operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Minister Geoff Prosser yesterday confirmed Japanese boats would be paid rebates if they were eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is an international agreement that if international fishing vessels stop at an Australian port to refuel, they are not charged excise," his spokesman said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Similarly, Australian vessels refuelling overseas are not charged excise."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our case is simple, Minister. I put to you that what is happening is that we have two identifiably different schemes where one is being confused with the other. We do not have Australian fishing vessels operating in Japanese waters in any numbers&mdash;there might be three or four private operators&mdash;and going to Japanese ports. We have literally hundreds of foreign vessels operating in our waters. It is exactly the same as a foreign company operating on our land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this amendment says is that those vessels who want to get the diesel fuel rebate must be registered in Australia. If they are foreign, they should not get it. It is the same as any foreign mining company registered in Australia: it would get the DFR here but not if it was not operating here under Australian law. That is the purpose of my amendment. I look forward to your response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must begin by thanking Senator Patterson for stepping down the list and allowing me to speak first as I have a luncheon engagement. My real purpose in standing today is to thank Senator Ian Macdonald, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), for his prompt action in response to my request to send additional cat traps to Macquarie Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very fortunate in having the opportunity to visit Macquarie Island for a period of five days last year. It was an incredible experience and one that will hold me in good stead in relation to the amount of information I was able to gather from the various scientists working on a wide range of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that was brought up time and time again was the problem of feral animals on the island&mdash;not just cats, but also rabbits and rats. Last year they had an extensive cat trapping program, thanks to Robert Gould&mdash;also known as `Ferret'&mdash;who has just come back on the last voyage, and who has spent a total of 15 months on the island trapping cats. His wage is partly paid for by the tourists who visit Macquarie Island as he also acts as a tourist guide. Last year he trapped more than 260 cats, but was very frustrated because the number of traps on the island did not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3852"> enable him to adequately trap in all of the grid references he had set up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we tramped over the island for those five days one of things we were asked to do was to report back any sightings of cats or scats. I was one of the those who on a number of occasions unfortunately came across traces of cats. They were obviously doing very well. I am very pleased to say that Senator Macdonald okayed the $3,000 needed to get another 40 wire cage traps onto the island. They were purchased from Mascot Wire Works at a cost of some $69 each and were sent down to Tasmania to wait for the island voyage. They sat on the dock ready to go on 1 April; and they arrived at Macquarie Island on 20 April while <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyage 6</EMPHASIS> was there. It was fortunate that there were helicopters on the vessel, as was the case on my trip, and they were able to be deployed by helicopter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems has been actually getting traps around the island. Some of the traps they had been using were very flimsy and I was told by those trapping that unfortunately some of the bigger cats manage to find their way out of them before they are checked. I am assured that the new traps that have been sent down are very strong and, if baited with some of the baits that attract the cats&mdash;particularly sardines&mdash;good results are hoped for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of yesterday, the results are already depressing, but also pleasing. The main trapping season is after the birds go and the birds start leaving during March. Indeed, most of them have gone by the end of this month. The traps are starting to be set up at the end of April. In other words, the traps deployed for this season have only been out a couple of weeks and already 45 cats have been trapped. The cat traps are left out there until about October because, once the birds start returning, there is another food source for the cats and it is very difficult to actually entice them back to the traps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian government has put in an application to the federal government for a far more detailed program. It involves shooting. If we look at some of the experiences New Zealand has had in ridding its islands of cats&mdash;and they have succeeded now on one of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them&mdash;we find it is extremely expensive to get those last couple of cats. It costs something like $35,000 a cat to get rid of the last few cats once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The traps are only a temporary measure, but, if they had not been sent, the rate of breeding up again through the winter and then the feeding season over the summer was going to make it extremely difficult to control them. We would need to put in even more resources at the end. I would argue that Senator Macdonald has seen money well spent, because the $3,000 will help to hold the numbers down until the full program, which hopefully the federal government will consider seriously, is put in place so that once and for all we can rid Macquarie Island of feral cats.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3852"><TITLE>Conference for Older Australians</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about the Conference for Older Australians. This is part of this government's vision for older Australians. By 2020 one in every four Australians will be aged over 65. One only has to use one's imagination to know what that will be like. In fact if I live that long, I will be part of that population. It is an issue which we have to address from all perspectives. In just over 25 years' time the median age&mdash;that is, half the population will be below this age and half will be above that age&mdash;will have risen to 40 years of age. Half the population will be below 40 and half above.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is conscious of the ageing of the Australian population and of the negative and damaging stereotypes that exist about older people. The conference, which had been set up by the Prime Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), has two major roles. One role is to coordinate the government's involvement in the International Year of Older Persons to take place in 1999. The United Nations has designated that 1999 will be the International Year of Older Persons. The second role is to devise strategies to promote a positive image of older people. The two main goals are the government's response and promoting a  positive image. The conference will also provide advice on matters referred to it by the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3853"> Minister for Family Services. It has those two main functions and demonstrates this government's commitment to older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of that committee&mdash;and we have not met yet, but hopefully we will do so in the next four to six weeks&mdash;are Ita Buttrose, Maureen Kingston, Major General Digger James, Sir Raymond Ferrall, Burnum Burnum, Marion Lau, Kay Hocking, Len Dickson and Terry Underwood. These people have been chosen because they represent various states and levels of expertise and interest in this area. They will also assist me as chairman of that conference, as appointed by the Prime Minister, to actually fulfil that role. It will give Australia a real goal or aim to reach a very positive outcome as a result of the International Year of Older People.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference will provide a nexus for local, state and Commonwealth government as well as national and community groups to engage in a positive and productive dialogue. It will also seek to challenge negative stereotypes about ageing and promote the interests of older Australians. It will perform an integral role in advising government on strategies for dealing with an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the International Year of the Family a couple of years ago and, unfortunately, it was not the success that it ought to have been. It stalled for a number of reasons. In fact, I think we were worse off because it was not a successful year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the International Year of Disabled Persons, and I think it was in the early 1980s, there was not only an impact in that year to raise the awareness of Australians of the abilities of people with disabilities, to raise the horizons and to raise their expectations of what they were able to do and to demonstrate to us what they could do, but also an impact to make Australians who do not have an obvious disability more aware of the needs of those with disabilities. We still see the effects of that year rippling through in terms of access to telephones, access to parking and access to buildings, and buildings codes have changed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hope that the International Year of Older Persons will have the same impact, that it will have an impact in the year 1999 and that it will have a long-term rippling effect into the next century. It needs to do that because the baby boomers will be a very demanding population of older people. We have been very spoilt, are demanding and are well educated. Most of us have had jobs all our lives, but not all, unfortunately. So I have a personal vested interest because I will be in that age group, but also I believe we need to provide a way forward for younger people coming up by actually having policies in place that will deal with an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, the Year of the Family did not get the accolades that it should have got if it had been run more efficiently and there had been better outcomes. Margo Kingston in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 31 December 1994 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Year of the Family was a damp squib, with PR events and bickering about whether gay families were families and whether single parent families were as ideal as two parent ones.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">G. McNamara in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 30 December said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Year was characterised by lost opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Office of the International Year of the Family was tossed back to Family Services from the Prime Minister's department after it had exhausted its usefulness to Mr Keating during the 1993 election campaign. The chairman of the IYF advisory council, Jennifer Rowe, resigned. One might make some comments about that, but I will be generous and not do so. Had there been better leadership in that situation, she may not have resigned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was a mismanaged year and there were wasted opportunities. There was money that could have been spent more appropriately and we should have had better outcomes. That is not going to happen with the International Year of Older Persons but, I have to say, we have got out of the starting blocks a little later than we ought to have. Towards the end of her time in office, Minister Carmen Lawrence was approached about being involved in the International Year of Older Persons and her response was that it was too soon to start
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3854"> planning for IYOP, so we did not start planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to give credit where credit is due. Di Moran from the public service in Western Australia did not give up. She pressed on and negotiated with people from the other states, at a state level, to actually make a bid for the United Nations International Year of Older Persons conference, and what a great thing that would have been if we had that in Australia. What a great fillip. What a great booster. But, we did not get it, despite their best attempts. Everybody who was involved in that ought to be given great credit. They competed, but one of the reasons we did not get it was there was no Commonwealth involvement. So who got it? Canada, and we missed out on having the United Nations conference here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we started slightly shackled because we did not get off to a good start like that. But, fortunately, there are other people in the community&mdash;rather than the former Labor government, which seemed to lose its way and the Australian public realised that and voted it out of office&mdash;who had vision. For example, Di Moran is now chairing the Healthy Ageing Taskforce, which is a task force that has been set up by the COAG process of all ministers in community services and health, to coordinate the states' activities in the area of seniors and, in particular, the state's responses to the International Year of Older Persons. She has enormous energy and was a great driving force behind that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Council on the Ageing also saw the opportunity, and I believe they pleaded for us to be involved when Labor was in power to try to get that conference, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. The Australian Council on the Ageing under Denys Correll has been instrumental in assisting and setting up Coalition 99, which is chaired by Delys Sargeant. It is a community organisation to coordinate the response of the non-government sector in planning for the International Year of Older Persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these people with vision were involved and they were not given the support they really needed from the Commonwealth. That has changed. The Prime Minister (Mr How
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ard) has responded&mdash;as there should have been a response from the Labor government, but there was not&mdash;and we are determined. I ask that all members of parliament on all sides of the house, both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, join with us in making sure that this year not only has an enormous impact for older people but also has a long-term ripple effect into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference will focus on the positive, on issues associated with the positive aspects of healthy ageing. We want to explode the stereotype of ageing and older people as those sucking money out of the public purse. There are some older people who are frail and who definitely need our assistance, but there are many of them out there&mdash;and over 75 per cent of them are over 80&mdash;who do not live in residential care but are in their communities and are active and contributing to their community. Many of them are giving an enormous amount of their time in voluntary activities that goes unrecognised and unrewarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to change that. This particular International Year of Older Persons in 1999 is going to give a new dawn to older people going into the next century. American research shows that problems accepted as normal in 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in 1982 are being pushed out now and are not appearing in people until they are in their mid and late seventies. So we are seeing an expansion of the abilities of older people as health improves and we need to capitalise on that. We need to make sure that we recognise and cultivate the abilities of older people and make sure those abilities are used in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to celebrate seniors in that year and we want to honour older Australians. They are the pioneers on the voyage of life. They are the ones who are going to set the examples for us as we grow older, and there are many of them from whom we can learn a lot about keeping active mentally and about keeping active physically. I ask senators on both sides of the chamber and my colleagues in the House of Representatives to assist by approaching this in a bipartisan way in order to make this a year to remember, to make it

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I propose to highlight the double disadvantage that women with disabilities suffer. They suffer a disadvantage not only because they are women but also because they have a disability. In fact, if these women were of ethnic or of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, they would suffer a triple disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Double disadvantage' is not just my phrase. It is a phrase that has been used by many authors when writing about women with disabilities. The 1992 inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia, undertaken by the House of Representatives, produced what has become known as the Lavarch report. It had similar things to say. It stated that women with disabilities experience double disadvantage because of society's expectations of women's abilities as well as attitudes towards people with disabilities. I must add that I am not discussing a minority here. I am talking about a group that makes up nearly 10 per cent of the Australian population, or some 1.6 million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an advocacy group called Women with Disabilities Australia which is attempting to achieve a level of equity for this section of the Australian population. They have provided me with a great deal of information on the subject. Their membership brochure states that the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that women with disabilities are more often institutionalised, are less likely to work for money, earn less, are less likely to own a house and are less likely to receive requested personal care and household assistance than men with the same needs. This is in addition to all the normal discriminations they face because they are women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Hundreds of intellectually disabled teenage girls are being illegally sterilised by doctors' was the claim in a page 3 story in Brisbane's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> just last month. The story went on to outline research carried out by a Queensland Family Services Department officer and a Melbourne doctor which re
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vealed that, of 1,200 sterilisation operations performed in Australia between 1992 and 1995, only 20 had Family Court approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officer conducting the research also added that these figures were probably a gross underestimate, as her research had not included public hospital patients. A 1992 High Court case has effectively made sterilisations with court approval illegal. This means that doctors are committing criminal assault on these girls. They are ignoring the law because of an apparent attitude that it is, after all, only women with disabilities that they are dealing with!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very worrying fact to come from ABS data is that women with disabilities are often forced to live in situations which make them vulnerable to violence. Their disabilities make them dependent on others for assistance and mean they are often subjected to various forms of violence, including physical, psychological and sexual. Such violence, which frequently is perpetrated by a carer, often is tolerated because of the high level of dependence. Society seems to ignore the existence of violence by attendant carers or institutional carers against women and many of these women either are in a helpless situation or do not know where to turn for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been numerous media reports of sexual assaults, rape and abuse of women and girls with disabilities who are in institutions, as well as those who are out in the wider community. This type of abuse only lowers further the self&hyphen;esteem and self&hyphen;worth of women who already suffer from both of these conditions. In other words, the downward spiral of self&hyphen;esteem is constantly being pushed even lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if these women could contact support services or the authorities, which in many cases would be difficult, they often lack the confidence to speak out and complain. Often these women are so isolated and cocooned that they are completely uninformed about the options they might have to escape from their predicament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Groups like Women With Disabilities Australia believe that there needs to be more research on violence against women with disabilities. The fact that there is very little
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3856"> literature on the subject at all only helps to emphasise the ignorance that there is on this issue in the community at large. The other thing that is needed is a campaign to boost the image of women with disabilities. The emphasis should be on what these people do and can do, rather than what they cannot do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Invisible' would be a good word to describe women with a disability. Even groups who are fighting for recognition and equality for women seem to ignore the plight of women with disabilities, as do many disability groups. What hope, then, do these women have when it comes to having their needs met? I would say that they would have very little hope at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that politicians, government departments and the general public started to recognise that there are many women with disabilities out in the community. It is also time that they started to learn how these women can contribute to the community. There needs to be a great deal more writing and research on the experiences of women with disabilities and women from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, and it is essential that women of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent are included in those studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, boosting the positive images of women with disabilities is a must. We need to find out what services are required by these women. What sort of support do they need? In terms of providing the best chances for these women in the future, we need to ensure that young girls are given every chance of a good education and are provided with support and positive encouragement to give them the best possible chance for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of any research, combined with the expertise of women's organisations and disability groups, should be used to develop the empowerment of women with disabilities. Funding should be made available to appropriate groups to provide support to these women. Legislative changes may also need to be made, to allow for the improved status of women with disabilities and to allow them equitable access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on giving my views and the views of organisations here, but what about
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the women themselves? How do they feel, what do they need and how do they see their future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996 a project was undertaken in Victoria with a small grant of $12,000 from the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation. Wide consultation and the opportunity for women with disabilities to participate was a key principle of the project. Women with physical disabilities were contacted and invited to participate in regional workshops and free phone&hyphen;ins and to complete a questionnaire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this project is a wonderful start, one of its shortfalls was that it exclusively involved women who were members of network groups and regional service users. The hidden or invisible section of this community who would obviously require the most support was not involved. This effectively leaves a big gap in the information that this project obtained. Nevertheless, the information and data put together is still very revealing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wellbeing of these women is obviously low. The sorts of comments which were made included, `My wellbeing is affected by the degree of positive human relationships' and `Loneliness makes me unhappy.' The factors most often mentioned as influencing their wellbeing were loneliness and depression. This was closely followed by income and employment related issues and more than half the women said that the cost of aids and equipment or the lack of required services also affected their sense of wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments made by these women about health services was also very revealing. They did not always reflect well on medical and health services staff. There were comments such as, `Once I was diagnosed with acquired brain injury, I was automatically treated as a second&hyphen;class citizen,' and `Need more support from GPs after disfiguring surgery or trauma, not just Valium.' Maybe it is best summed up by the statement of one woman who simply said, `I just do as I am told.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In summarising the project report, loneliness, income and employment as well as cost of aids or lack of services were reported as frequently influencing wellbeing in women with disabilities. The enormous diversity of the types of disabilities was also highlighted.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3857"> They ranged from cerebral palsy, spinal injury, multiple sclerosis and post&hyphen;polio syndrome to sensory and auto&hyphen;inflammatory conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not assume that most of these women have suffered with their disabilities all of their lives. In fact, the opposite is true. Most of the women were disabled as adults. Therefore, they have obviously experienced the changing attitudes of other people towards them and they are quite capable of making comparisons of services, feelings of wellbeing and self&hyphen;worth and comparisons of a whole range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fatigue was something experienced by most and was seen to interfere with women's interests or ability to participate in many ordinary activities or roles. Most women were worried about deterioration of their health and feared loss of independence and hospitalisation or institutionalisation. Fear and worry seemed to be feelings shared by many. It is up to the community and governments to address these fears and worries and allow these women to develop a positive self&hyphen;concept. It is up to the community and governments to ensure that women with disabilities do not remain forgotten and invisible. This is an issue that cannot be tolerated and cannot be forgotten.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3857"><TITLE>Model Criminal Code</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic that I wish to canvass in today's matter of public interest debate is the Model Criminal Code&mdash;in particular, the discussion paper on Model Criminal Code, chapter 5, relating to sexual offences against the person. There has developed within the community, in relation to this discussion paper, an unhelpful accusatorial style by the protagonists. There is no doubt that the individuals who worked on the Model Criminal Code and, in particular, chapter 5, gave of their best and tried to present what they considered to be an appropriate document for public discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that this is a document for public discussion. It is a document developed for government, not by the government. Indeed, immediately inside the cover we are told:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a discussion draft. It contains the views of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. It does not represent the views of the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With the benefit of hindsight, it may well have been preferable for the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General to have at least given some preliminarly vetting to the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that many in the public arena do not necessarily understand the legal niceties of the division between the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General and the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General itself, and I do not blame any government for the release of the document in its present form. With the benefit of hindsight, it may have been better for the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General to have given the document some degree of preliminary vetting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The topic of sexual offences and changes to the law in this area usually attract a degree of community interest. The Model Criminal Code is no exception. Some of the recommendations of the committee are to be applauded, and this needs to be registered. It is easy to criticise&mdash;for some reason, harder to be gracious. The committee must have spent many hours working in this difficult area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Model Criminal Code, like any criminal code, must be built on a foundation or moral construct. It must determine which behaviours to criminalise and which not to criminalise. Fundamental moral judgments are required. As the discussion paper notes, at page 5:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What can realistically be achieved by the law has, from time to time, been questioned. However, this should not diminish the importance of what the law ought to strive to achieve. By outlining proscribed conduct the law can serve a vital educative and symbolic function in its condemnation of unacceptable behaviour. In this way, the criminal law can work to set a powerful benchmark for community standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This comment in the discussion paper is welcome but with respect to some of the recommendations I believe it has been ignored. For example, the document tells us, at page 10:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3858">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's view is that the Model Criminal Code should not have specific offences relating to homosexual conduct, either in private or in public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an interesting proposed development of the law which came into force with the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994. Only 2&half; years ago we were told that it was only homosexual practices in private that were to be decriminalised. Now we are being told that public activity will be okay as well. Those promoting the changes in 1994 stressed the importance of the limitation to private conduct. That is clearly a matter that will entertain further public discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A matter which has received a lot of commentary relates to the proposals on age of consent. At page 99 of the commentary on the code, the committee says the following about the age of consent:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated above, unless a defence operates to make consent an issue, consent is irrelevant to sexual offences against children. The age, therefore, at which a young person should be considered to have the capacity to consent to sexual relations is difficult and typically controversial. It effectively amounts to a determination about when young people should be allowed to exercise autonomy and freedom of choice in sexual relationships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is interesting to note that the committee was dead right when it said that this area would lead to controversy. The opening paragraph to this controversial area has undoubtedly allowed some to unwittingly misinterpret the Model Criminal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I do have a problem with the recommendation at page 105:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the age at which a child is deemed by law not to have the capacity to consent to sexual activity be set at 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that there are many public policy reasons to substantially increase the age. I believe that, if the committee took to heart its own comments as to the law being a powerful benchmark for community standards, then the age of consent should be increased from that which is proposed. At age 10 we are talking about children in grade 4. To consider they might have the capacity to understand the sexual act is to require too much of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that the sexual act is not only a physical act. Emotions tend to run very high as well. A child should be protected
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from such activity. We are told by the committee that determining the age at which the children have the capacity to consent amounts effectively to a determination about when young people should be allowed to exercise autonomy and freedom of choice in sexual relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sexual relationships for children should not be seen in the context of simply going for a run or some other physical activity divorced from emotion. It does have consequences, usually emotional, including the risk of pregnancy and the consequences that flow from that. Whilst not all young people would be charged, the educative value of a higher age of consent should not be discounted. In layman's terms, could I suggest: let the kids at least get through primary school! At this juncture it is to be noted&mdash;and I want to stress this&mdash;that the age of consent which is spoken of relates to the children as between themselves between the ages of 10 to 16 years. The committee, in discussing the age of consent for homosexual activity, at page 101, makes the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that the age of consent for homosexual activity is usually older than for heterosexual activity. This age differential stems, undoubtedly, from the legal discrimination historically shown against consensual homosexual conduct. For example, that young males needed to be protected from older `predatory' males or deterred from adopting homosexuality as their sexual preference.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on page 101, and over on page 102, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also takes the view that the age of consent should be the same regardless of whether the activity is heterosexual or homosexual. The inference that might be drawn from an older age of consent for homosexual conduct is that homosexuality is an undesirable activity from which males should be both protected, and deterred, until adulthood. It is questionable whether this is an appropriate aim of the criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that homosexuality is an undesirable activity. It is, I submit, an appropriate aim of the criminal law to encourage young persons not to engage in such activity especially in that phase of their life where young people are developing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how many people believe that it is a desirable outcome for young people to engage in homosexual activities. I
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3859"> note with interest that the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act relates to privacy issues only for people over the age of 18 years. This would be an appropriate standard. To have an age of consent of 16 years, especially for young men, I believe, leaves them too vulnerable to predatory males. It is for this reason that the policy position of the Model Criminal Code in dealing with heterosexual and homosexual activities is misplaced. The quality of the two acts, I submit, are substantially different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations with which I have most concerns are those relating to incest. At page 135 of the discussion paper, we are advised of some of the arguments for a specific crime of incest. The paper reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these was eugenics. Eugenics is the `science' of encouraging the procreation of biologically and socially desirable populations and discouraging the procreation of inferior populations. A specific incest offence was effectively a way of guarding against inbreeding. Concern touched also upon genetics. Sexual contact between family members is said to increase the risk of a genetic defect in any child conceived. An incest offence is necessary to protect against such a risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition against sexual contact between family members is also heavily steeped in Judeo&hyphen;Christian tradition. In providing a specific offence of incest, the criminal law upholds the view that sexual contact within the family, whether between consenting adults or involving a non&hyphen;consenting child, is morally wrong and an offence against religion.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure that the committee is necessarily correct in saying that it is steeped only in Judaeo&hyphen;Christian principles. I think many of the other major religions of the world also have a similar taboo in relation to that sort of activity. Then, at page 137, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given its unjustifiable historical origins, it is questionable whether the incest offence is necessary or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the place of the criminal law to penalise citizens for moral or intellectual deficiencies. The criminal law should only punish acts contrary to sexual morality if they are harmful to society, for instance, where the victim is a child or not consenting.  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">May I respectfully suggest that incest is harmful to society&mdash;especially to the family unit, which I think is still viewed as the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fundamental unit within our society. If it is harmful to families, it follows that it is harmful to society.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Incest is a breach of the rules governing the relationship of the family unit. The family context is so fundamental that it must be seen as separate and different from other relationships in which abuse of power occurs. At page 137 of the discussion paper we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolishing the crime of incest would, rather than leaving a child unprotected, emphasise what is actually being done to him or her. It would also do away with the stigma attached to the offence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that attracting stigma to the crime of incest is an appropriate outcome, especially for the perpetrators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have set out some of my concerns in relation to the discussion paper. I note that many other people have noted concerns as well. It is vital, however, that any criticism be fair and informed. I think there has been unnecessary community concern about some aspects of the proposals&mdash;yet very justifiable in other areas. It is for that reason that I suggest to my fellow Australians that they take advantage of the opportunity of writing to the committee, which the committee specifically invites at page iii of the discussion paper. I will read the last part of the section entitled `Preface':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee not only welcomes submissions on any aspect of the proposed provisions, it actively solicits comments and criticisms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they are open to being criticised as well, and I think that is very good and healthy for the public discussion which will undoubtedly ensue. They go on to say:</PARA>

I will quote from an article on page 4 of Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which is headlined `One Nation poll ploy causes stir'. The opening paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Coalition figures are concerned about the level of voter support shown for an independent conservative candidate who used the slogan `One Nation Our Nation' on her how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards in a Queensland by&hyphen;election at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further down it identifies that person as Mrs Moran who had&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unsuccessfully stood for pre&hyphen;selection as a Liberal in Kurwongbah.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article then goes on to identify the concerns of the broad political spectrum. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Nationals are more concerned, with one conceding last night that the poll result "sends a message which is not particularly encouraging for either side of mainstream politics".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the next paragraph there is a comment from the State Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Mike Kaiser, who warned that although Mrs Moran was not formally a candidate for One Nation, the result was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a very rough simulation of what a Pauline Hanson candidate might do to the Liberals.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately following on from that, concern was expressed by the major political parties about the result of that by&hyphen;election last Saturday. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on Monday, under the headline `Blitz signals poll warning', John Lehmann commented:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Ms Moran is not a member of Ms Hanson's One Nation Party, she ran a campaign featuring Hanson&hyphen;like rhetoric, setting herself up as a person fed up with party politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her campaign literature distributed at polling booths on Saturday even went as far as using the slogan "One Nation&mdash;Our Nation".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Generally, if it walks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, one would normally expect it to be a duck. But on this occasion that is not the case. We had all the trappings of a Hanson&hyphen;generated environment in that by&hyphen;election and that was readily picked up by the media and by the representatives of the various political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This phenomenon that has blitzed us in the last 12 months or so could have been stopped, and that was brought home very clearly on Channel Nine's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. Part of that is reported, again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, of Monday, 26 May. I quote selectively from an article by Lenore Taylor. The first paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Pauline Hanson was a "disaster" for Australia which could have been completely avoided by an early and decisive response by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, the former Liberal leader, Dr John Hewson, said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How ironic that Dr Hewson had to come out and make that very true statement which, I believe, could have avoided this emerging phenomenon that we now see entering into the byplay of by&hyphen;elections and ultimately into elections in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson said Ms Hanson's effect on Australian politics had been "the biggest disappointment" in his 20&hyphen;year involvement and could have been "killed" by Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"One sentence on day one would have killed it," Dr Hewson said on Channel Nine's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program. "I don't think you ever would have heard of Pauline Hanson again."
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3861">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is very true. If leadership had been shown at the outset, we would not have seen the epitaphs to the Kurwongbah by&hyphen;election on Monday of this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Hewson also went on to point out the effect that the Hanson agenda is having on our relations with Asia. The article reports:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson, who travels to Asia at least once a month in his business career, said Ms Hanson was raised in meetings `without exception'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the Hanson debate was `doing a lot of damage in Asia and I think the reason is that they've always been suspicious about Australia . . . we've been moral schoolteachers to the region . . . without recognising that we, in fact, live in glasshouses ourselves'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think anyone could say it any better. The Hewson contribution to this debate quite clearly states that we are in the middle of a disaster. It could have been killed, and one sentence would have done it. What we have finally come to, of course, is that people of good character, goodwill and good intent are now fighting back, and this is a very pleasant thing to see indeed. They are fighting back for equality; racial tolerance; harmony; a multicultural society&mdash;which we undoubtedly are; mutual respect; and good old&hyphen;fashioned `love thy neighbour', because that is the ingredient that seems to be missing in our society today. There seems to be no respect by some people for the ethnic background of people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the fight back ultimately culminated after the weekend by&hyphen;election on Sunday with a major rally in Ipswich, in the heart of the Oxley electorate. That particular rally was well attended. There were some 3,500 in attendance and, of course, there were people from all walks of life, from all backgrounds and with varying degrees of interest in politics. But they all had one thing in common: they came to fight back against the Hanson agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of Monday carried an article by Mike Fishpool. Its headline alone says `Love and harmony wins over racism'. It is interesting to read some snippets from the article, in which he gives some of the flavour and feeling of what took place at that particular rally last Sunday. The opening paragraph reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jim and Thelma McCaskie are not the demonstrating kind, but they were determined to be at the community rally against racism at Ipswich yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chinese community was prominent with a large banner reading, `We love Australia&mdash;equality, tolerance, mutual respect and harmony'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mike Fishpool also reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were only a handful of dissenters, who could not dent the buoyant spirits of the event.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rally was also addressed by former Liberal senator Neville Bonner and it is reported that he said he hoped all parties would direct their preferences away from the member for Oxley at the next election. She is the person who has caused this fight back by ordinary, average, everyday Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reporting on this particular event last Sunday was well and truly summed up by an address from Jewish community leader, Laurie Rosenblum. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jewish community leader and war veteran Laurie Rosenblum said Ms Hanson's `evil agenda' had been exposed in her book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pauline Hanson, the Truth</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Rosenblum said Australia had been enriched by multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`What is the point of an art gallery with only one painting? Or a music store with only one song? But this is Pauline Hanson's ideal,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we have the situation that average Australians are prepared to stand up and to fight the intolerance of those who follow the Pauline Hanson line. I must commend those people. Whilst I was unable to get to that rally, I must commend those people who had the courage to attend it and to show that Australians do have a conscience, do have a social conscience and are prepared to stand up against the injustices that are currently being bandied around in our media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, though, all of this could have been killed off had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) taken effective action when it first raised its ugly head. The responsibility, I believe, continues to lie with the Prime Minister, along with every other citizen, to bury the Hanson debate, to bury the Hanson agenda and to bring back equality, racial

<SPEECH PAGE="3862" TIME="1.42 p.m." SPEAKER="Eggleston, Sen Alan" NAMEID="4L6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago I had occasion to go to Carnarvon and I spent some time with the Gascoyne Development Commission. I was very impressed with the information I was given by the commission about the potential of the Gascoyne region in Western Australia, so I thought I would take this opportunity to say something in the Senate about the Gascoyne and put the potential of the region on record in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the Gascoyne region is about 1,000 kilometres north of Perth on the mid&hyphen;west coast of Western Australia and is an area that offers tremendous economic and regional development opportunities. It is a region whose economic activity is now worth about $332 million a year and its close proximity to Asia means that the Gascoyne has the potential to become a major supplier of food exports to our Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, aquaculture is an industry that has the potential to grow substantially and to generate many local jobs and exports to the Asian region. Yet except for cultured pearls, aquaculture is a relatively new operation in the Gascoyne area. Currently, the region has two pearl hatcheries that are operating successfully. While in Carnarvon I saw first&hyphen;hand how pearls are cultivated and cod are bred in a farm&hyphen;like setting. In my opinion there is great room for growth and expansion in this area of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, aquaculture producers can quite easily capture the Asian and European markets by servicing these areas with delicious seafood grown in the region's unpolluted waters. The potential for the Gascoyne region to generate a lucrative aquaculture market, both nationally and internationally, is unparalleled in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another industry that has provided a firm and diverse base for the Gascoyne region and generates large capital is tourism. Tourism is one of the largest contributors to the regional economy and brings some $70 million a year to the general area. It is estimated that in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1993&hyphen;94 year, which is the last year for which figures are available, some 303,000 people visited the Gascoyne region. That figure would have gone up substantially in the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourists are enticed to the area primarily because of its pleasant weather, its fishing, boating and natural attractions, such as the Ningaloo Reef and the gorges and beaches of the Exmouth area. I think Exmouth has more tourist potential than Broome and I predict that, in due course, Exmouth may well outstrip Broome as a holiday resort because Exmouth's great advantage is that all the attractions are close together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my recent visit to the region, as I said, I had the opportunity to meet with the Gascoyne Development Commission in Carnarvon. The commission informed me that they are hoping to set up an Aboriginal cultural and heritage centre which will of course be run by local Aborigines. The centre should not only be a drawcard to visitors but more importantly will provide jobs for local Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aborigines in fact comprise 13 per cent of the total population of the region and increased levels of Aboriginal enterprise development and employment are essential if Aborigines are to gain greater social and economic independence. Aboriginal unemployment levels in the Gascoyne are very high and, in my view, tourism ventures are an excellent way to provide Aboriginal groups with rewarding employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Exmouth marina and proposed Exmouth resort development will also be a great boost to tourism in the Gascoyne region. Tourism could grow if international aircraft started operating out of Learmonth RAAF base, which was used to service the US Harold Holt radio base at Exmouth for many years. Over the time that the Americans were running the Harold Holt base, once or twice a week the world's largest aircraft&mdash;the Galaxy and Starlifter&mdash;called in to supply the Americans in Exmouth. Currently, the Exmouth Shire Council and Gascoyne Development Commission are seeking to have Learmonth made a designated international airport.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3863">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a designation would significantly improve export opportunities, and horticulture produce could be airfreighted to markets such as Jakarta, Singapore and Manila. Let me talk a little about the horticulture potential of the Gascoyne area. Horticulture is a mainstay of the region's economy and brings in some $30 million a year. It is important to note that, because of the Gascoyne's unique climate and high quality ground water reserves, it is a region that national and international buyers will look to for the purchase of off&hyphen;season vegetables and fruit. In that context the ability to airfreight vegetables and fruit to South&hyphen;East Asian cities becomes very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gascoyne produces more than half of Western Australia's bananas and, in addition, the region produces 15 per cent of the state's vegetables.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ELLISON" NAMEID="9X5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator Ellison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much better than Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much better than Queensland, bigger and more juicy. A variety of tropical and subtropical fruits are produced in the irrigation farms along the Gascoyne River. Table grape growing is an emerging industry in the Gascoyne and is expected to considerably increase in value as time goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have stated, the Gascoyne horticulture industry is an industry with considerable potential to generate both jobs and exports for Australia. In 1995&hyphen;96, Australia's food exports totalled $15 billion and approximately 40 per cent of these exports went to Asia. It seems quite evident to me that the Gascoyne region should tap into this market, and the government's announced supermarket to Asia strategy provides very ready means for the Carnarvon growers to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supermarket to Asia Council, which has been established by the Prime Minister to provide strategic direction and priority setting for the agrifood industry, provides assistance with promoting food products in the Asian area. I believe the growers in the Gascoyne area would do well to take advantage of this initiative, and I have put them in touch with the Prime Minister's department and the Supermarket to Asia Council to enable them to do this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another primary industry in the Gascoyne region is fishing, which is valued at around $60 million per year. Demand for Australian fish in the south&hyphen;east Asian area is said to be increasing. Our fish stocks are increasing as the fish stocks in the Pacific and Indian oceans are diminishing. There are some 72 pastoral stations in the Gascoyne region and of course the pastoral industry was the traditional industry of that area. Pastoral production in 1993&hyphen;94, again from figures provided by the Gascoyne Development Commission, was valued at some $17.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, Gascoyne wool prices are down and, because of this, pastoralists have moved away from wool production to meat from sheep and cattle and, interestingly, to goat farming. In the past, goats in the Gascoyne have been considered a pest. However, today some of the pastoralists harvest feral goats for meat and live export as South&hyphen;East Asia and the Middle East markets have considerable demand for these animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently, it was only salt that was mined in the Gascoyne region. However, today gypsum and limestone are being mined, and there are huge supplies of limestone to supply building requirements in Western Australia. Mining in the Gascoyne, in general, is valued at some $50 million per year. Mr Acting Deputy President, the Gascoyne region is approximately twice the size of your own state of Tasmania. It comprises 140 square kilometres of land area and represents about six per cent of Western Australia's total land area. It is, as I said, situated in the mid&hyphen;north of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gascoyne region is not equipped with good communications infrastructure. In fact, no mobile telephone services are available in Exmouth or Shark Bay, and there is no mobile coverage on the North West Coastal Highway. The region does not have an Internet provider, nor does it get SBS, Triple J or ABC Classic FM. Given that industry is generally attracted to regions that boast the best communications infrastructure, the poor communications infrastructure in the area is seen as a problem by the Gascoyne Development Commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3864">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that because of Carnarvon and Exmouth's relatively small population, these towns do not warrant funding for improved communications services. However, I would like the Senate to note that the Gascoyne Development Commission has made the very valid point that the population of the towns, together with the roving tourist population, should be taken into account in assessing the entire regional population when determining whether additional funding for communications infrastructure should be allocated to this region. A strong case can be made for the communications infrastructure to be improved because the Gascoyne contributes greatly to the national economy, and that also validates the case, in my view, for the provision of SBS, Triple J and Classic FM to the people of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have previously stated, the concerns of the North West are very much my concerns, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to place on record in the Senate that there are tremendous economic and development opportunities in the Gascoyne region. In summary, the Gascoyne has the potential to be a major food supplier to our Asian neighbours, and it is a region which will continue to contribute very strongly to our national economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday's announcement by the ANZ that it will reduce its home loan interest rate to 6.99 per cent is further good news for Australian families. The St George Bank yesterday also cut its standard variable rate to 7.05 per cent. This is a further vote of confidence in the government's economic strategy. When the coalition was elected, the standard variable loan rate was 10.5 per cent&mdash;just over a year ago. It is now 6.99 per cent&mdash;a 3.5 per cent reduction since we were elected. What does that mean in dollar terms? As the honourable senator said, on a $100,000 loan, that is $292 a month in interest rate payments that Australians are better off. Madam President, do you remember the comparison? Interest rates under Labor, 17 per cent: families paying $1,417 a month in the same circumstances. Under the coalition, 6.99 per cent, $707 a month&mdash;from $1,417 down to $707. That is the distinction between Labor and the coalition. Under Labor, record high interest rates; under the coalition, the lowest home interest rates since 1969.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the government's policy to reduce debt, which was opposed at every step by Labor but, nevertheless, we were determined to do it. We inherited a $10.3 billion deficit. Within the space of three years, we will turn that to a $1.6 billion surplus. What is the reward? The reward is low interest rates, low inflation, low debt and strong investment. Yesterday's figures show capital spending 18.6 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor stands condemned. Labor, by comparison, had high deficits, high debt, high interest rates and high taxes. Speaking of taxes, very briefly, where does the Labor Party stand on the issue of tax reform? All over the place, it would seem. What did Mr
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Beazley say? He said it was a distraction. What did his shadow Treasurer say? At the same time that Mr Beazley said it was a distraction, former Senator Evans said, `There may be a case for tax reform. Of course, we would have to look at any such proposal.' He, of course, got a slap across the cheek, so the next day he came back and said, `Of course, tax reform is a second or third order issue in this country.' But nobody told Mr Tanner to shut up&mdash;Mr Tanner, another frontbench spokesman of the Labor Party. What did he say? He said, `Labor must examine alternative foundations for our tax system.' Mr Beazley is saying, `Ignore it, take no notice,' and Mr Tanner from the Left is saying, `It's time to examine tax reform.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very important question. The short answer is we are bringing them back into the game. They have felt like second&hyphen;class citizens for 13 years. Labor switched them off, and we are in the business of switching them back on. We are doing that in a variety of ways, not only through high&hyphen;speed access to the Internet but by bringing forward Telstra's FMO, which ensures enhanced services are available some three years ahead of the scheduled date; by giving them ISDN technology, which will be in place by the end of next year; and by encouraging facilities like telecottages and e&hyphen;mail&mdash;in other words, by allowing farmers and people in rural areas to get the benefits of the telecommunications revolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tragedy, against that background, that Labor is not in the slightest bit interested in helping the bush. Do you remember how they fought tooth and nail against the Telstra privatisation bill? They did not concede for a moment that there were any benefits attached to a $250 million rural infrastructure program.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> To ram home the point and show that they have learnt nothing since that time, who, on the day after the budget, should put out a press release bagging that fund once again but Senator Schacht, clearly wanting to insult the bush!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the incredible thing. We all know what he has been doing in recent weeks, since it looked as though the numbers had turned decisively against him for preselection. He wandered off to Japan. He made a few statements on the car industry. He got up on the adjournment debate. He went on about industry policy. In other words, he is obsessed by trying to get back into the game and appealing as a last&hyphen;ditch effort to the people of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does this press release do? It complains and it sets out a table that demonstrates what he would regard as the perfidy of this policy by having a per capita value attached to each of the states&mdash;in other words, how many people in rural areas get how much money per head out of this fund. What does his table show? What is he complaining about? He is complaining about the fact that South Australia does better than New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland or Western Australia. I can understand why he might want to spend a lot more time back in South Australia, because, if there is something he has to explain to his own people, it is why he would regard South Australia as deserving of a worse deal. The fact is that you have no commitment to the bush and you do not understand the benefits of giving access to telecommunications facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He goes on to then complain that, in only one month, Telstra spends more money on capital expenditure than we have in this $250 million program. What are we meant to read into that&mdash;that you are going to commit yourself to spending a lot more than $250 million? Of course not. You are not prepared to spend one red cent on helping the bush. You are not interested in whether people get access to these facilities, whether farmers and people in regional areas can get onto the Internet, whether they can get the latest information on weather and other commodity reports. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3869">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not interested in anything but playing politics. Senator Schacht said that and regards that as his great virtue&mdash;that he is not a policy man; he is only interested in politics. Well, this is very poor politics. You are losing the game everywhere else. Lindsay Tanner is exposing you; Kim Beazley is burying his head in the sand; and you have got Senator Schacht compounding the felony.

It is a question that needs to be resolved, and I think that will become more apparent as the legislation comes before the Senate. We will get some sort of estimate.

The Treasurer, of course, is quite entitled to mention who his favourite bank is. Let me go to the substance of your question. The issue is low interest rates, in particular to small business. This is the party which encourages low interest rates. Our strategy has been directed since coming to office to setting up the circumstances by which we can ease the pressure on interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Labor's recession that we had to have in the early 1990s was Australia's worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Will the minister outline the ways in which the Howard government is putting in place policies and reforms that will ensure sustained employment growth in the long term?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Tierney. This government has put in place the framework for consistent and strong economic growth. It is our fiscal responsibility that has in fact laid the groundwork for the interest rate reductions that we have already seen&mdash;four in a row. This means more investment and more jobs. Fiscal irresponsibility means fewer jobs, and that is what Labor did. Unlike the previous government, which jeopardised the interests of unemployed Australians by maintaining a policy of adding year by year to increasing levels of government debt, we will not do this. Labor did that for 13 years; this government is far more responsible. Unlike Labor, this government has not been passing blank cheques on an empty bank account that was going further and further into the red. We are repairing the mess after 13 years of very poor Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Net government debt was $17 billion when Mr Keating hacked his way into office. By the 1996 election, it had grown by almost $100 billion to reach $110 billion. To get a grip on the size of that, Madam President, you
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to understand that total government outlays in 1996-97 were $130 billion, yet net government debt was $110 billion. The yearly interest rate on net government debt in 1996-97 was over $9 billion. That is almost the cost of two higher education sectors to the Commonwealth. For the interest of those who ask about reductions in funding in law enforcement, that interest bill is nine to 10 times the cost of all Commonwealth spending on public order and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some on the other side would suggest that the Labor gravy train could have continued indefinitely. Of course it could not have. Senator Carr, from the very left of the Left over there, would have no qualms about continuing to spend, running up debts that this generation's children would have to pay. Enormous government with enormous debt is the hallmark of Labor around Australia. Senator Carr and others like him on the other side seem to love debt. His association with the failed Kirner and Keating governments is great testimony to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, on the other hand, has a fundamentally different approach. The boom and bust days of Labor are over, because the boom always helps the top end of the town and the bust rips apart the battlers. Labor should have spared a thought for what they were doing to the battlers when they were drinking champagne with Laurie Connell, Alan Bond, et al. This government believes that steady growth allied with low interest rates and low rates of inflation is the only long-term way of increasing employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last bust we had, that recession, they destroyed 420,000 full-time jobs&mdash;330,000 were held by men and 220,000 were held by young Australians. The number of long-term unemployed increased from 114,000 to 349,000. Youth unemployment went from 14 per cent to 34 per cent. It has left a devastatingly deep stain of unemployment on the Australian economy. The bottom line is that Labor has never had a proper grip on economic issues. It is consistent and steady growth that will provide long-term opportunities for sustained employment growth.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am addressing myself to the question and answer given on the question of Senator Lightfoot's views on the position that Aboriginal people have in this nation today. I repeat again that in my 20 years in politics, in my 20 years as a member of parliament, I have never heard a more ignorant, ill&hyphen;informed or offensive statement made by a member of the Australian Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out that Senator Herron was a President of the Queensland Liberal Party for many years. The Queensland Liberal Party expelled, with a great deal of breast-beating and boasting, the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) from the membership of the party. As a lifetime member of the Labor Party, I know what an extreme step it is to take to expel a person from membership of a party, particularly for the Liberals. She was rightly expelled from the party for her statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lightfoot is a Liberal and now a sitting member of the Senate. Senator Lightfoot arrives here carrying a $460,000 pension from the Western Australian parliament with a seat in the Senate, and Pauline Hanson gets expelled! The minister for Aboriginal affairs says in defending him, `It's a broad church we've got in Australia. It's a democratic society and he's free to say anything he likes.' That is what the minister for Aboriginal affairs said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not extraordinary that, as it just happens&mdash;and I must say I was grateful to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> for publishing this fascinating piece of Australian history yesterday&mdash;James Douglas, the 14th Earl of Morton and president of the Royal Society, was a greater liberal with more advanced thinking about the Aboriginal people of this country in 1768 than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), his minister for Aboriginal affairs and, certainly, our new senator from Western Australia are in 1997? I will quote briefly from the extract of this fascinating advice given by the Earl of Morton to Captain James
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3883"> Cook on his way to Australia in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS>. In relation to the native people of this country&mdash;the native people of this country, Senator Lightfoot&mdash;he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To have it still in view that shedding the blood of those people is a crime of the highest nature:&hyphen; They are human creatures, the work of the same omnipotent Author, equally under his care with the most polished European; perhaps being less offensive, more entitled to his favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are the natural, and in the strictest sense of the word, the legal possessors of the several Regions they inhabit. No European Nation has a right to occupy any part of their country, or settle among them without their voluntary consent. Conquest over such people can give no just title; because they could never be the Aggressors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a tragedy for Aboriginal Australia that that direction given to Captain James Cook was never given effect afterwards. But, I personally know seven 7,000 or 8,000 Australian Aboriginals, mostly living in Arnhem Land in the Top End, who are native Australians and who live traditional lifestyles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first started to live among them 30 years ago, as an ignoramus then in respect of Aboriginal Australia, I was absolutely struck by the richness of their lifestyle, the complexity of their culture and their relationships, the beauty and complexity of their languages and the degree of family relationships that our society has long lost. I listened with fascination in my first contact with native Aboriginal Australians, thousands of whom are still living like that today, as Senator Herron full knows, as they pointed out parts of the landscape around them, identifying the people who owned it back four and five generations, all from memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lightfoot might be interested to know that Aboriginal people in native Australia living traditional lifestyles, as I said before, have a richness of culture second to none, a richness of culture which clearly the Western Australian senator, who has Aboriginal Australians living in this situation in his own state, is absolutely ignorant of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this to Senator Robert Hill, and that is why I wanted to address it to Senator Hill. Senator Hill, you are supposed to be the leader of the Liberals in here. Why don't you

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel compelled to rise and speak on this issue and perhaps put some matters in focus. Firstly, I would say that, if we continue with the name calling and the exchanges that have been going on, I think we will advance the debate no further.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is only one thing missing in this debate and that is the white sheets and burning crosses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we were to dwell on comments like that we would get nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at deeds rather than the words. Let us look at what has been done and let us look at what this Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has done. I put it to Senator Bob Collins, through the chair, that Senator Herron has done a great deal since he has had this office. He has visited over 60 communities. He is the only minister to have visited ATSIC in Perth, Western Australia. He was asked a question about Abstudy, which is not even in his portfolio. What the opposition is trying to do here is to score a cheap political shot and play the man and not the ball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the budget provisions in relation to ATSIC, which I dare say Senator Faulkner has not even seen. I challenge Senator Collins on it. What part is wrong with the announcement that we made of a new four&hyphen;year, $120 million indigenous business incentive program? What is wrong with that? What is wrong with putting ATSIC funding on a forward estimates course so that ATSIC can now have some security in the way it plans its finances? What is wrong with that rather than the year&hyphen;by&hyphen;year, ad hoc approach that was the hallmark of the previous govern
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3884"> ment? What is wrong with bringing in a program which will bring jobs to indigenous Australia where we have an unemployment rate at 38 per cent&mdash;a shocking rate? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this minister is doing, and I say that to Senator Collins in particular. I notice you do not ask him about Aboriginal health  because he knows more about that than all of you put together. But, of course, that is not in his portfolio so you do not ask him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was timely that we celebrated the 1967 referendum, which was brought in by a coalition government. Governments around this country, including the federal government, celebrated that fact and also took note of the stolen generation report. Today you have heard the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, admitting that it was a blemish on the history of this country, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can wear sackcloth and ashes and speak here at great length but it will not get the job done. That is what Senator Herron has been about since he has been in this portfolio&mdash;getting the job done. That was done by visiting in excess of 60 communities, seeing what the situation is like on the ground and seeing that we have a long way to go with health. It was all very well for former Senator Richardson to get his photo in the paper when visiting a community. But where was the result of his work in health with indigenous communities? After 13 years what did we see in relation to education, health and unemployment in the indigenous sector? We saw a disgraceful lack of attention&mdash;in 13 years. This government has only been here for 13 months and already we are reducing the rate of unemployment, we are increasing economic opportunities and we are announcing programs of the sort that I just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are only going to help indigenous Australia by empowering them and by giving them opportunities in health, education and employment. As the good book says: by their deeds you shall know them, not necessarily by their words. A lot of rhetoric has been spoken here today. You judge us by our deeds and the electorate will when we go to the next

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been seven state inquiries and they have all recommended the retention of the leasehold system. But what I think is important to this debate is the history, because the actual pastoral leasehold land system is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3885"> unique to Australia. It is unique to Australia because it reflects a particular history of Australian land settlement. I do not think we should lose sight of the fact that lease tenures were developed as essentially an expedient response to the outward settlement that was happening: the uncontrollable settlement away from colonial Sydney, for example, during the 19th century. A lot of this was so uncontrollable that governments decided to issue licences to use land for pastoral purposes. That was clear but between the 1850s and the 1960s, between&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HERRON" NAMEID="VW4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to tell you, Minister, that between the 1850s and the 1960s we saw a lot of subdivisions of leases. The purpose of that was to promote closer settlement. But this brought its own problems, such as environmental disasters because of very small grazing areas, and the high use of rents. It had to take account of erratic climatic conditions and limited market infrastructure. So it is not surprising that all of these inquiries have said that the maintenance of leasehold is the best way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we have seen in your 10&hyphen;point plan the beginning of the argument about freehold. Graziers are now arguing that they have to have freehold title because it provides the security of tenure needed to facilitate development&mdash;and by that they often just mean improvements to the property. Those arguments ignore the evidence. We seem to have slipped over this little point of history: pastoralists have not had exclusive use of the land and Aboriginal people throughout all this time have been able to have access to the rangeland for traditional and cultural purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in my view has to work out in the 10&hyphen;point plan a system to accord property rights in alignment with the cultural resource and policy framework that recognises this history. I do not think what you have in point 4 at the moment does that. Moreover, I think it leads to the possibility that there will be speculative rent seeking. We have seen what has happened where there has been an area of up
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grading at Cape York. That enabled speculators to capture local land monopolies of up to 3,000 square kilometres. I do not think that point 4 of the 10&hyphen;point plan reflects the history and the cultural balance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak in this debate. Can I say that the comments that Senator Cook referred to, as reinforced by Senator Lightfoot today, are the most offensive, racist comments I have heard in this place in my 16 years of parliament. I know I do not have the full five minutes to speak but the point I want to make is that one needs to make a very cold and sober comparison between what Senator Lightfoot said before he arrived in this place, which he reinforced today, and what Pauline Hanson got kicked out of the Liberal Party for. Let me just remind the Senate of her sin when she was expelled in February 1996. In the comments which led to Ms Hanson's resignation she said that racism in Australia was created by the government looking after Aborigines too much and handing them a tremendous amount of payouts. She said Aborigines could walk into a job in the police force, receive lenient court sentences, had better chances to get better housing and business loans and were the main instigators of crime and violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were the comments for which she was expelled from the Liberal Party.

I say to Senator Herron and Senator Hill, who have failed in leadership today, that this matter has to go immediately to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Lightfoot has to be judged on the principles that we want Australians to live by, those decent  principles of humanity and dignity of individuals.

That is abhorrent to all of us. It is now a question of leadership and it goes straight to the Prime Minister. Unless this person is judged in the same way as others have been in the past, we will find that all the rhetoric, particularly in this reconciliation week, means nothing. This is a sad day for Australia; it has in fact been a tragic week for Australia, because an opportunity for us to embrace and reconcile has, at every opportunity, been dropped by the government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that needs to be made in relation to the seriousness of the comments that Senator Lightfoot made after question time today is this: Ms Hanson, who was a Liberal Party candidate, said that racism in Australia was created by the government `looking after Aborigines too much' and handing them a `tremendous amount of payouts'; that Aborigines could walk into a job&mdash;the police force&mdash;receive lenient court sentences, had better chances of getting housing and business loans and were the main instigators of crime and violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response from the Liberal Party, during the last federal election when those statements were made by Ms Hanson, who was the endorsed Liberal candidate for Oxley, was appropriate. She was dealt with by the Queensland division of the Liberal Party and she was placed outside the Liberal Party and the Queensland division of that party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a real test here for Senator Hill and a real test for Mr Howard because Senator Lightfoot is a sitting senator. Senator Lightfoot is not an endorsed candidate contesting a House of Representatives seat for the Liberal Party as Ms Hanson was. Senator Lightfoot is a member of this chamber. He is a member of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. The sorts of comments that we have heard today from Senator Lightfoot will have repercussions not only in this parliament and this country but also in relation to Australia's standing in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot stress enough to Senator Hill that he pass on to Mr Howard how serious these statements are. I believe it is incumbent on the government to act and act quickly. We need on this issue now leadership from Senator Hill and the Prime Minister. The only leadership in my view that will be acceptable is for the strongest possible action to be taken to send the clearest possible signal to all Australians and the international community on the views that this parliament has in relation to the issues that Senator Lightfoot has canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lightfoot has made the most damaging contribution in this chamber today. It is the most serious thing that I have heard since
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have been in this place. I listened to other senators comment who have been in this parliament and in other parliaments much longer than I have about the seriousness with which they viewed the comments as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This requires leadership. It requires very firm leadership from Mr Howard. It requires firm leadership and principle from the Liberal Party at both a parliamentary and an organisational level. I do hope that Senator Hill will pass on to Mr Howard the seriousness with which I believe all senators share the concerns about the nature of the abominable, intemperate and damaging remarks that have been made in the Senate chamber this afternoon by Senator Lightfoot.</PARA></SPEECH>

There are two interpretations of what has happened today in relation to the statements made by Senator Lightfoot and in relation to the statement made by Senator Hill, which is appreciated by the Senate and probably by the wider community. One is that Senator Lightfoot does not mind bringing the parliament and his party into disrepute.

If that is the case, then there are very, very serious implications for the electors of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As senators would be aware, the government tabled the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families on Monday afternoon. Today I wish to outline the processes the government will undertake to address the recommendations contained in the report. I hope that by presenting this statement today the opposition and minor parties have had the opportunity to examine the report. I know that it has been very short time frame, as was evident during question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is a very detailed and lengthy document of almost 700 pages canvassing a wide range of issues. I would like to say at the outset that the report catalogues what can only be described as a sad and tragic episode in Australia's history. I myself had commented earlier that it was horrific.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I have said before, anyone wanting to understand the aspects of the indigenous experience and some of its contemporary characteristics would be well advised to read some of the individual case histories and evidence reproduced in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much discussion in recent days has focused on the question of an apology for the events recorded in the report. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Governor-General and myself have expressed our feelings in this respect. It should be noted that the main focus of the report is on how governments should deal with the continuing effects of past policies in terms of the family reunion and related services and on current policy and practices.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government acknowledges the impact of these past policies and practices and is already working to address the significant disadvantage currently being experienced by all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report's 54 recommendations can be broadly grouped into three categories: firstly, reparation or compensation for the individuals, their families, communities and descendants; secondly, reunion, health and other services for those affected by past policies and practices; and, thirdly, Commonwealth legislation to regulate current state and territory child welfare adoption and juvenile justice practices and to enable transfer of jurisdiction to indigenous organisations as a form of self-government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations are wideranging. They cover the responsibilities of a number of governments and other organisations. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments and non-government organisations, including the churches, which are the subject of many recommendations, will need time to fully consider the report. I will be writing to my Commonwealth colleagues seeking their advice in relation to a range of recommendations that fall within the Commonwealth's area of responsibility. Also, as I outlined on Monday, I will be writing to my state counterparts asking that their governments carefully examine the report and the recommendations which are related to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report will be considered by the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs when it next meets in August, at which point I would expect the states and territories to have examined the report and provide some indication of actions they propose to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry also suggests that national framework legislation be introduced&mdash;presumably, by the Commonwealth&mdash;to regulate current police, judicial and/or departmental functions in relation to child welfare, adoption and juvenile justice. This would represent a significant interference on the part of the Commonwealth in state and territory
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3892"> responsibilities. Such action would do nothing to alleviate the situation of people who suffered from the past policies and practices which led to the removal of indigenous children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding these reservations, these proposals concerning Commonwealth legislation in relation to adoption, child welfare and juvenile justice will also need to be considered by the functionally responsible ministerial councils in due course and, ultimately, the Council of Australian Governments. In this context, the Commonwealth is very concerned about juvenile justice issues. We will be addressing these concerns through initiatives such as the young offenders pilot projects announced recently in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry also supports the eventual transfer of responsibility for child welfare, adoption and juvenile justice to indigenous peoples as an expression of self-determination. This would be a matter for the states and territories, as I said, to consider in the context of their current arrangements in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Commonwealth level we will need to give careful consideration to those recommendations which suggest action on the part of the Commonwealth. As I have already made clear, the government is committed to developing a practical response based on a commonsense approach that addresses the present and the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would again reiterate that the government, in its submission to the inquiry last year, made it clear that it could see no equitable or practical way of paying cash compensation. As stated in that submission, the government does not believe that the actions of the past can be judged according to contemporary values. While this should not detract from a recognition of any failures of governments in the past and their consequences, it does suggest that monetary compensation is neither appropriate nor acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government stated that, even if compensation were considered warranted, the government could see no equitable or practical way of now paying special compensation to those persons affected. As I said
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the report was tabled, this position remains unaltered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside the question of monetary compensation, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the report is flawed in its analysis of many of the key legal issues. It should also not be forgotten that, in the midst of this tragedy, there are a large number of very dedicated people and organisations, including the churches, who genuinely believe that their actions were for the benefit of indigenous Australians. Today, of course, neither the government nor right&hyphen;thinking Australians would either contemplate or condone those actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would acknowledge that this is a very emotional and important issue, not just for indigenous Australians but for all Australians. It is about heart and soul and family. I would hope that we, as members of the national parliament, can take a constructive and mature approach to this issue. That means a calm and sensible consideration of the report and its recommendations and a commitment to seek a practical and realistic response.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a very disappointing and unsatisfactory response from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), having sat on the report for some seven weeks, apparently not knowing what to do with it. Having undermined the report and the author before it was made public and having aroused the public clamour for a response to the report, what we have from the government and the minister today is a damp squib. It is a process response; it is not a substantive response. In my view it is, in a sense, a non-response. It is not the response Senator Herron promised us in question time today. It is utterly devoid of content, like the minister who delivered it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the national inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, is a document of profound historical significance for this country. The response of the government to the report and its recommendations will mark a water
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3893"> shed for the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Will they stand exposed as bereft of compassion, as lacking in insight and having no courage? Will their equivocation and weak leadership be exposed as a mask for the moral bankruptcy and intellectual impoverishment that has characterised the time that this government has been in office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that this is a report of substance and merit. It brings a breadth of research and a depth of understanding that offers hope that we can effectively address a root cause of both continuing disadvantage amongst Aboriginal people and the frequent failure of government&hyphen;sponsored policies and programs to alleviate targeted problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report goes to the heart of the truism that the problems of today are inextricably linked to the history of dispossession, discrimination and social dislocation that is the shared experience of Australia's indigenous people. This report chronicles stories across generations of the systematic suppression of a culture and of the systematic and deliberate destruction of Aboriginal family units. These policies stamped on the basic structures of Aboriginal society and they all but destroyed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stories in the report tell of individual pain, loss and suffering. They document an approach by governments, churches and private agencies that assumed and hastened the ultimate disappearance of a people and their culture. The fact that that destruction was not complete is testimony to the courage and resilience of individual Aborigines and the strength of the indigenous society in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The energy and goodwill that have characterised efforts by Commonwealth governments from 1972 onwards in their endeavours to advance the interests of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to improve their health, to better house them, to better educate them and to empower them by giving them tools for self-determination have not been matched by uniform or widespread success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of this report and the insights and recommendations for action that it offers
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> really offer hope for greatly enhanced effectiveness in policy and programs. We have to confront past mistakes. We must address the implications of dealing with people and communities who have been deeply scarred by their experience of the dominant society. We have to acknowledge that, unless we accept that the policy of tearing apart indigenous families is a root cause of the circumstances, mind&hyphen;sets and behaviours that impede individual and social betterment in indigenous communities, we cannot improve anything. The government has sought to absolve itself with some trite suggestions like it was done for their own good or many of them benefited from the experience. Government members should read the report, and so should many Australians. Judge for yourselves how well these things stand up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A common platitude attributes the social advancement of a few notable Aboriginal people as proof of the overall benefit of past policies, and the report really nails that myth. It presents authoritative studies that show that the numbers of indigenous Australians with post&hyphen;school qualifications is slightly higher, at 4.8 per cent, amongst those who were not taken from their families than those who were, at 4.4 per cent. The number of those removed from their families who are unemployed or out of the work force is higher, at 69 per cent, than those who stayed with their families, at 66.5 per cent. Differences in health and personal incomes were similarly differentiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no benefit in objective outcomes to balance against the massive spiritual, personal and social damage directly attributable to the stealing of indigenous children. The Prime Minister has still not apologised to the indigenous people forcibly removed from their families or the families and communities that were blighted. Only John Howard citizen has apologised. There is not the same weight of national regret and the recognition which  would go some way towards healing past wrongs&mdash;and they are the wrongs that cry out from this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Ronald Wilson, rightly says that saying sorry has nothing to do with guilt; it has to do with the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3894"> recognition of past wrongs. Mr Howard, Senator Herron, Pauline Hanson and others are the ones who keep talking about guilt. There are two possible reasons for Mr Howard's inability to exercise his authority and stature in this matter as Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One possibility is that he is just unable to grasp the substance and texture of the Australian nation, that he is unable to see past the Hills hoists, the comfortable vacations at Christmas time at Hawks Nest and sanitised 1950s history tests about explorers and squatters. The Prime Minister cannot understand the tumultuous history that made this nation what it is and that, among the triumphs, hurts were inflicted on hundreds and thousands of our indigenous people. It is not a black armband view of history but the reality of our past which causes him great discomfort and perhaps a twinge of guilt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other possible explanation is that, in denying Aboriginal people the comfort of an apology, Mr Howard is playing cheap politics, appealing to an imagined narrow&hyphen;minded and bigoted constituency with a hope of a boost at the polls. If that is so, he sells this country short and he does not deserve to lead this nation. If Mr Howard fails to apologise as both the Western Australian and South Australian premiers and parliaments have done&mdash;and I hope that this parliament will do so&mdash;he will enter the history books as an apologist for all that is narrow and mean spirited in the darkest corners of our wider society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are racist forces abroad in our community. They are affecting our society. They are affecting our relationship with our neighbours. The Prime Minister appears unwilling to either recognise them for what they are or deal with them. Our past policies on the environment are the fault of people ignorant of the consequences of their actions. It could be argued that our past actions and policies towards indigenous people were also borne out of ignorance, even though the removal of children from their natural parents is the height of cruelty and this fact could not have been lost on the perpetrators. And we heard something about that in question time today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Mr Howard needs to ignore what he reads as mainstream opinion from the opinion polls. He has to ignore Pauline Hanson, and he has to become Prime Minister. He should apologise. On behalf of all Australians, he should be taking the initiative to have this parliament apologise. He should apologise now. In the absence of a government initiative, I am moving an amendment today that gives the Senate the opportunity to unreservedly apologise to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians for the separation policies. This is an opportunity to do that. I urge all senators to see the Australian Senate adopt the amendment which I will formally move to the motion before the chair and commend to the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , I think is one of the most significant reports to be tabled in this parliament. I say `most significant' for two reasons: because of the truth it reveals and because of the choices that it opens up to us as the parliament of this nation in 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, I want to go to the truths. It is true that there were government policies, practices and laws which resulted in the forcible separation of indigenous children from their families&mdash;practices in place almost from the very first days of colonisation; policies of protection, of segregation, of merging, of absorption, and, when that did not work, policies of assimilation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in the name of assimilation in the 1950s and 1960s in this country that we saw this practice of forced separation at its peak. Indigenous children were removed from their families for a range of reasons. I do not think it is appropriate to say it is all for reasons of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> neglect, because we know what underpins assimilation: it is that ethnocentric view that they have to be like us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another truth which is revealed is that these policies and practices and laws inflicted almost unbearable pain and trauma on an entire generation of indigenous Australians and their families. In this report is the truth that the plight of many indigenous Australians today is a consequence of this history. I think it is that link of understanding between the policies and the consequences which is absent from the considerations of so many Australians today on the plight of contemporary Aborigines. A lot of contemporary Australians are likely to point their finger at symptoms&mdash;symptoms of high imprisonment rates, high numbers of juvenile offenders, the level of alcoholism in indigenous communities, unemployment levels and dysfunctional families. They point their fingers at the symptoms in ignorance of the causes. And I do not say it is a wilful ignorance; I do not think it is. But it is an ignorance that is caused by our failure to tell the real history and to own the real history of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a black armband view of history&mdash;it is one based on truth. Truth does not require us to wallow in guilt, and Aboriginal Australians are not asking us to wallow in guilt. But truth does require us to listen and to acknowledge. When I talk about the distinction between symptoms and causes and when I talk about the way in which the impact of these policies has contributed to the plight of Aboriginal Australians today, I think there are a number of sections from this report that are really worth quoting. I start on page 227, which reminds us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ways of relating and ways of nurturing are passed from generation to generation.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is confidential evidence on page 226 from a woman who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a rotten mother. My own husband even put my kids in the Home and I fought to get them back. And then I was in a relationship after that, and he even put my kids in the Home. I think I've tried to do the best I could but that wasn't good enough. Why? Because I didn't have a role model for a start.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We could spend hours referring to the poignancy and the pertinent remarks made here,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3896"> but in the time available we will not be able to do that. On page 229 there is a description from a psychotherapist at the Victorian Koori Kids Mental Health Network about James's family, which includes a description of his grandmother Helen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Helen was removed from her family at the age of four and placed in a white institution. She was not allowed contact with her parents and left the institution at 17 to work as a cook in the city. She had no family to support her and no idea of where she came from. She became pregnant very young and was unable to care adequately for any of her children as she had severe socio&hyphen;economic problems and was unable to cope because she had no model from which to develop her own parenting skills. Her partner was alcoholic and violent and she became very depressed and began to drink. As her own ability to trust and form close relationships was damaged due to her traumatic removal from her parents at such a young age with no substitute attachment figures provided, she was unable to maintain intimate long&hyphen;term relationships, her marriage broke down and all her children were placed in care by `the welfare'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the link between symptoms and causes. This is the link which Australians need to make, and I hope this report really helps them to do that. The structure of this report, the detail of the history it gives to us, is very useful information. I hope our schools make great use of it as a resource document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said this was a most significant report because along with the truth it also reveals to us the choices. How can we listen to these stories and turn away with a cold heart? How can we forget the way in which humanity can touch humanity? Are we not parents ourselves? Are we not somebody's children? How can we deny our humanity and say, `Well, it is all their fault'? That is one of the real strengths of this report&mdash;the opportunity to listen, to acknowledge, and I think the other choice: the choice to open our hearts and to care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Pat Dodson said at the Reconciliation Convention yesterday, how would we feel to go home to institutions where there were no loving arms of mothers or aunts or grandfathers or basically anybody who cared? How would it affect us to grow up with that absence of intimacy and affection, the things that make us able to cope with the demands of stress and the pressures of everyday life?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mick Dodson said, don't we think Aboriginal people feel pain as we do? This report is a very moving record of that pain. Apart from the deaths in custody report, this report is going to be the most moving testimony of that pain that we will ever see in this nation. I certainly hope that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the choices. I cannot do better than the words of others from yesterday, because we have no Aboriginal representatives in this parliament; they are not here to speak for themselves. I would rather use their words. Their words were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is now on the table. The defence of ignorance is no longer available. Individual Australians are not responsible for the past actions of others. But if (we) Australians (and the parliament of Australia in 1997) fail to respond to what we now know, that will be another thing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And these are the choices we must make. We do have important choices to make on how we respond. Yes, we must apologise. It is absolutely crucial. It costs nothing; it means so much. We should not be pre-occupied with the material, with the possible cost of compensation, but with the words&mdash;the fact that we are prepared to say them and acknowledge the fact. That is what means most to Aboriginal people and that is why federal governments and state governments have to do it. We have to open the way for forgiveness. I apologised on Monday and I do so again unreservedly in this parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the report focuses on reparation, not compensation. I think it is important to note that because reparation involves a multitude of options which may not cost much money. I personally think that we need to set aside financial compensation. I think we need to discuss as a parliament, in consultation  obviously with indigenous Australians, what form that should take. But, more than anything, I wish the best response to this report will be that people read it, that people listen, that people hear the stories and that they open up their hearts so that they can forgive us&mdash;that true reconciliation is possible and we can start a new century together.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very much afraid in this parliamentary process that what we are seeing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3897"> from some members of the government is in fact their own truth. It is in fact a form of revisionism. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper on Tuesday, 27 May, the member for Swan, Mr Randall, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a lot of wrong information about Aboriginal children being taken from their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In WA he knew of many children who had been put into missions at the request of their parents because they could not care for them. "They were not stolen, they were willingly taken and cared for and educated at the request of their parents who could not look after them because of poverty," he said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Randall chose not to stand in a minute of silence in the House of Representatives because he said it was a stunt. Like Senator Kernot, I think the answer to revisionists are the words of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. So I would like to quote from a person who suffered in Western Australia whose name was known as just Millicent. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They told me that my family didn't care or want me and I had to forget them. They said it was very degrading to belong to an Aboriginal family and that I should be ashamed of myself, I was inferior to whitefellas. They tried to make us act like white kids but at the same time we had to give up our seat for a whitefella because an Aboriginal never sits down when a white person is present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then the religion began . . . We had religion rammed down our throats from hypocrites who didn't know the meaning of the word. We used to get whipped with a wet ironing cord and sometimes had to hold other children (naked) while they were whipped, and if we didn't hold them we got another whipping. To wake us up in the morning we were sprayed up the backside with an old fashioned pump fly spray. If we complained we got more. Hurt and humiliation was a part of our every day life and we had to learn to live with it . . . My life was miserable, and I felt I was a nobody and things couldn't get any worse. But I was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I was in first year high school I was sent out to work on a farm as a domestic. I thought it would be great to get away from the home for a while. At first it was. I was made welcome and treated with kindness. The four shillings I was payed went to the home. I wasn't allowed to keep it, I didn't care. I was never payed for the work I did at Sister Kate's so you don't miss what you didn't get, pocket money etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first time I was sent to the farm for only a few weeks and then back to school. In the next holidays I had to go back. This time it was a terrifying experience, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> man of the house used to come into my room at night and force me to have sex. I tried to fight him off but he was too strong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This woman did in fact get sent back to the home she was put in and was punished for speaking those horrors. She had her mouth washed out, had her ears boxed and was beaten again. She was sent back to the farm and was raped and bashed not only by the farmer but also by one of the farmer's workers. She also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ate rat poison to try and kill myself but became very sick and vomited. This meant another belting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The awful irony for this woman was that she in fact did fall pregnant and her baby was taken away from her, just as her mother's was. Do you know what the terrible sin was that forced her and her brother to be taken into care? It was that the Protector of Aborigines and the Child Welfare Department said that they `would have a better life and future brought up as whitefellas away from our parents in a good religious environment'. She says, `Because my parents were fair in complexion, the authorities decided us kids could pass as whitefellas.' That was the reason they were put into the home. And we are still getting the revisionism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, 26 May 1997 the headline in the same paper was, `Get&hyphen;tough bid on solvent abusers'. As Senator Kernot indicated, in Western Australia the response to the understandable problems of long-term grief, often dysfunctional families and substance abuse is to lock them up even more. Mr Day, the police minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ideal world it would not be treated as a criminal offence . . . but if no other opportunity  was available we might need to consider dealing with it through the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He favoured detention in a drying&hyphen;out facility or health centre rather than the local police station. Bully for him. What if he had just taken the time to work out what was the cause of some kids going off the rails? What if he had decided to work with the Aboriginal community to work out what the problems are if this is a health and justice problem? It is not good enough. The report itself has indicated that other countries are dealing with this in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3898"> a much better way. Page 280 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, there is an international legal obligation `to repair the damage caused, awarding the victims means of rehabilitation and, where applicable, compensation or economic indemnification' . . . This obligation passes from the violating government to its successors until satisfaction has been made (Lutz 1989 page 206).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I want to say about the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> &mdash;it can be said without fear of contradiction&mdash;is this: this is a report the government did not want to have. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is on the public record with his views about this inquiry. Let there be no mistake: this is a report that Australia would never have had if John Howard had been the Prime Minister of Australia in 1995, which is when the former Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, to his eternal credit moved to have this inquiry established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All indigenous people in Australia and all good and decent non-indigenous people who cherish the importance of indigenous culture know that John Howard has questioned `the practical benefits' of the inquiry and its report. The report has been sitting on the ministerial desks of this government for more than seven weeks. In that time the government, in the guise of `senior government sources', has been busily trying to white&hyphen;ant the contents of this report with a grubby campaign in the Canberra press gallery to undermine those responsible for delivering it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mishandling of this important report is one of the more disgraceful episodes in this government's brief history. This report has been described by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson&mdash;one of the direct targets of this government's campaign of character assassination&mdash;as the sorriest of sorry stories. He is absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report traces the systematic attempt by governments in this country to conduct what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3899"> was one of the most comprehensive peacetime programs of social and biological engineering in the developed world. It was an Australia&hyphen;wide endeavour to sever the descent lines of indigenous identity, language, culture and spiritual belief. It was, in fact, genocide. Genocide is the deliberate extermination of an identifiable people or nation. That is precisely what the governments of this country have set out to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report traces the forcible removal of thousands of indigenous children from their families in the forlorn hope the original occupants of this country would eventually be bred out. As the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the early 1960s it was clear that despite the mandatory way in which the assimilation policy had been expressed, Indigenous people were not being assimilated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those Aboriginal people insisted on remaining Aboriginal people&mdash;many of them&mdash;and retaining their culture and identity. Thank God they did. Discrimination by non-indigenous people and the refusal of indigenous people to surrender their lifestyle and culture were standing in the way of this process. It is not possible, as the report says, to state with any precision how many children were forcibly removed, due to the absence of official records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first went to the Northern Territory, those official records were still being kept in the MLC building. I have visited the office of the Register of Wards on many occasions. The Register of Wards was known colloquially in the Northern Territory as the stud book. It was kept for many years after I arrived. I had many discussions with the staff who kept it. It was for a long time the most accurate register of Aboriginal births and deaths that was kept in the Northern Territory. But the basis on which it was established can never be forgotten. Aboriginal children, because of their colour, were removed instantly from the legal care of their parents at birth and made wards of the state, irrespective of the circumstances of the families that were involved. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can conclude with confidence that between one in three and one in 10 Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families and communities in the period from approximately 1910 until 1970.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can tell you, from very personal experience indeed, just how recently those forced removals were going on. My wife's sister was reunited last year with her daughter, and that daughter is in her early 20s. This is not ancient history we are talking about here. I simply wanted to make that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her daughter was cared for, to the ignorance of her mother, by a Darwin family. She grew up in Darwin and, I might add, received a great deal of love and care in the family that she was adopted into. But she realised once she was in her teens that she was in fact Aboriginal, and she set out herself on a process of trying to find out who her mother was. As I said, they were reunited just last year, and she is now living with the Tiwi people, of her own choice, on Bathurst Island. So this is not ancient history we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In certain regions and in certain periods, the number of children who were, to their great distress and to the distress of their parents, forcibly removed was much greater than one in 10. In that time, not one indigenous family escaped the effects of forcible removal, and this was confirmed by representatives of the Queensland and Western Australian governments in evidence to the inquiry. Most families have been affected in one or more generations by the forcible removal of one or more of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report makes it clear that it was not until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, on a policy platform of Aboriginal self-determination, that the means existed for indigenous groups to receive funding to challenge the very high rates of removal of  indigenous children. The policies of self-determination are complete anathema still to some people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch very briefly on the Prime Minister's immediate reaction to public debate on this inquiry last year. I have already quoted what he said&mdash;that he saw very little benefit from actually conducting this inquiry. But he said more. As all honourable senators know, the Prime Minister immediately leapt into print attacking `the politically correct guilt industry' and `the Aboriginal industry',
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3900"> declaring that Australians should not adopt a black armband view of history. He then talked about the balance sheet of history and wondered aloud about the practical benefits of this inquiry. I think the substantive nature of this inquiry and the incredibly important evidence it contains&mdash;now enshrined in perpetuity for the first time&mdash;give the lie to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about that black armband view of history&mdash;which is code, as we all know, for saying that it is okay to ignore it or pretend that what happened in the past did not happen. I am not into guilt at all. I do not believe for a minute that anyone should feel personally guilty&mdash;they can if they like&mdash;about what happened in the past. But I absolutely agree with Father Frank Brennan when he said, as clearly as he always does, that it is not a question of guilt at all&mdash;and, as a Catholic priest, he should know all about that&mdash;it is a question of at least honestly owning your own history, it is a question of looking it in the face and acknowledging the truth of it. I have to say I thought at the time that, even though I am not into guilt, I would much rather wear a black armband than a blindfold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that can be said&mdash;and I will conclude on this&mdash;about those dreadfully ill-informed and misjudged policies of the past is that at least the people who perpetrated them had some excuse. The knowledge then of the complexity and richness of Aboriginal civilisation and culture was largely unknown. The whole basis of the policy of forcibly removing children from their parents was the ignorant premise that Aboriginal people living in a traditional lifestyle were the lowest colour in the spectrum of civilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it particularly extraordinary that Senator Lightfoot made that statement in here only half an hour ago. I welcome his apology, but I was astonished to hear him say that he no longer holds the views he held in the past. I must say there must have been some very interesting conversations that took place outside this chamber for him to repudiate what was, in real terms, the most undiluted and pure piece of racism I have heard uttered by a member of parliament in all of the time I have been a member of parliament. There
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must have been some talking outside this place that persuaded him that the views he held half an hour ago he no longer holds, but I welcome his apology for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1970s I had the greatest privilege and learning experience of my life when I lived and worked for four years with the Gunardpa people in Arnhem Land as the only non-Aboriginal in the community. Two years after I arrived in the community, I barely spoke English in my normal day's activities. The thing I learnt in those four years was that that culture had a system of family relationships and religious practices that was incredibly rich and in fact equated, without any question, with any other civilisation or culture I have ever being exposed to. Perhaps that is something Senator Lightfoot should take the opportunity to have a look at first&hyphen;hand at some stage.</PARA>

There is no way we can express the awful tragedy at an individual and community level this policy wrought upon the indigenous peoples of this country. There is now an opportunity for us to reconsider and move into the future with an open heart and with the recognition that that past should never again be allowed. The way we can ensure that that past never be allowed again is by continually revisiting it as part of our history, as part of Australian history, that can never again be submerged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stolen generation's saga affects every corner of this country. It affects the Aboriginal people of Tasmania as it affects the Aboriginal people elsewhere around the country. We must move beyond the period of apology, if we get there&mdash;and that is an apology unreservedly required from the elected leader of this nation, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), on behalf of the nation, to reparations as yet to be determined. It is a task for us all to undertake toward a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that we make that journey. On Monday, a great opportunity was blighted by the cavilling and conditional words of the Prime Minister. It was a moment of potential, positive, historic landmarking. It was a moment that was failed by the Prime Minister. It is an opportunity that rarely comes but, nevertheless, as he will know from the response he has had nationally and not just from the meeting in Melbourne, it is incumbent on him now to find the opportunity in the near future to do what he failed to do adequately on Monday. I will be amongst the many millions of other Australians who will support him, if he rises to that moment in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak against the amendment to the motion. There is no doubt that the amendment is good in parts and the general sentiment would be accepted by the government, but it is inappropriate to move a motion that endorses some of the recommendations of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , before people have actually had a chance to read it.

It is hardly appropriate that an amendment be moved endorsing a report that the majority have not seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in the response I gave in tabling the document, I have already pointed out that the government has begun to develop a response and the recommendations are wide ranging. We are not trying to obfuscate on it. They cover the responsibilities of a number of governments and other organisations. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments and non-government organisations, including the churches, which are the subject of many recommendations, will need time to fully consider the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I did indicate also, the report will be considered by the Commonwealth&hyphen;state Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs when it meets next in August, at which point I would expect the states and territories to examine the report and provide some indication of actions they propose to take. These proposals concerning Commonwealth legislation in relation to adoption, child welfare and juvenile justice will also need to be considered by the functionally responsible ministerial councils in due course and, ultimately, the council of governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That amendment, for example, `calls on the federal and state governments to establish, in consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, appropriate processes to provide compensation, et cetera, and appropriate education programs.' They are state responsibilities.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will outline the reason I have moved this motion. The British government announced a total ban on landmines by the year 2005&mdash;not just a partial ban but one that includes a ban on detectable and self&hyphen;destructible mines as well. The British move, unfortunately, still has an out clause until the year 2005 where landmines could be used in a combat situation, when deemed essential to winning a conflict. The British move is part of the British Labour Party's election pledge to review British arms trade policies in terms of their consequences for human rights. The decision on landmines has been their first real announcement. What will be interesting and crucial to watch is whether they cancel the contract between British Aerospace and the Indonesian government for 16 Hawk jets and armoured tankers. That we will wait for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia had a very successful national day of action on Monday, 26 May 1997 with the public stepping on landmine stickers that they can peel off their shoes. The stickers read, `Your leg has just been blown off by a landmine.' They proceed to state the facts about the number of people killed or maimed by landmines each year. They state the manufacturers, the countries affected and what states can do to reverse the scourge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred million landmines are currently deployed in over 60 countries and the US estimates that they kill or maim over 25,000 people, mainly civilians, every year. The national day of action was organised by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.  Australian coordinator, Sister Patricia Pak Poy, has said that Australia coming out in favour of a total ban on antipersonnel landmines, with a suspension on operational use, has not been enough. The international campaign wants Australian to act more consistently, first by destroying our own stockpile of the weapons and, secondly, by working seriously towards a global, unconditional ban.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3904">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1996 the Australian government sent a delegation to a pro&hyphen;ban conference in Ottawa where it pledged to work towards having a ban treaty in place as soon as possible. Canada has suggested it be by the end of 1997 and at least 50 countries have pledged to have a ban treaty in place by next January. However, since the Ottawa conference Australia has backed away and is now joining the United States, which prefers a slower approach through the Conference on Disarmament, CD, at the UN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The landmines movement is split between those who favour the slow approach through the CD and those pro&hyphen;ban countries which want action and are prepared to take voluntary measures to implement a ban as soon as possible. Having 50 nations on board is no mean feat and a number of key CD states, such as the US, the UK and France, have stated their support for CD negotiations, arguing that that would be a slower approach but would include most of the world's important mine producers and users, especially China, India, Pakistan and Russia; as well as staunch opposers of the ban such as Israel, South Korea and Turkey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, bringing landmines into the Conference on Disarmament, a forum for nuclear and conventional arms negotiation, brings with it its own problems. If the landmines issue becomes part of the Conference on Disarmament agenda, it will be used in trade&hyphen;offs between nuclear and conventional topics. Countries in the non&hyphen;aligned movement believe antipersonnel mines would be used to overshadow negotiations on nuclear issues, a development that the non&hyphen;aligned movement and countries that are seriously working for nuclear disarmament are desperate to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this leaves the Ottawa process as one where Australia, as a pro&hyphen;ban nation, could express its real support for a total ban on landmines. Lip service from Australia is not enough. Although Australia suspended operational use in April 1996, Australia continues to maintain a stockpile of antipersonnel landmines, despite declaring its support for a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ban. Australia must now take further action to destroy the rest of its landmines stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am calling for support for two things today. I am asking that the Senate notes:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor opposition is pleased to support this motion. Labor has repeatedly called upon the Howard government to agree to the unilateral destruction of Australia's large stockpile of antipersonnel landmines, with exemptions only for the absolute minimum of stocks to allow the Australian Defence Force to continue effective mine clearance training. Senator Margetts's motion does not refer to this  minimal exception, but we are sure senators recognise it as a necessity if the ADF is to continue its very valuable role in support of ongoing mine clearance work around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Destruction of Australia's landmine stockpile is a measure which has also received bipartisan support from the majority of mem
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3905"> bers of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is, consequentially, a matter of great regret that the government is unable to agree to the unilateral destruction of the stockpile. Public destruction of the stockpile would contribute significantly to the development of an international consensus that landmines are not a legitimate weapon of war&mdash;a vital foundation for the negotiation of a global ban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conversely, as the coordinator of the Australian network of the international campaign to ban landmines&mdash;Sister Patricia Pak Poy&mdash;said on Monday, `It is unconscionable for Australia to maintain its stockpile of landmines while declaring its support for a global ban.' As Sister Pak Poy has said, we simply cannot pay lip&hyphen;service to a ban and continue to maintain a stockpile of these weapons for possible operational use. We must start destroying them. Labor will continue to take every opportunity to press the Howard government to do the right thing on this vital humanitarian issue. The opposition will continue to urge the government to take a positive approach to the so&hyphen;called Ottawa process. This Canadian initiative for the conclusion of a ban between like&hyphen;minded pro&hyphen;ban countries by the end of this year has great potential to give a major boost to the efforts to achieve a global ban through negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament. It deserves Australia's wholehearted support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will also be supporting this motion on landmines. We supported this stand throughout the last government and this government. If senators look at the report of the treaties committee when we looked into our treaties involving landmines, one of the recommendations we made&mdash;there was some dissent but very little&mdash;was that we should look at destroying our stockpile. I believe we should destroy our stockpile, except for those few mines we would need for training people in destroying landmines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something we have been pushing for all along, and it is something that the treaties committee has also said that it would like to see. That is something that is in this motion.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The treaties committee called on the government to do the same thing. Destroying our stockpile of antipersonnel landmines&mdash;except, as I say, for those few training ones&mdash;is a very good move and one that we should take immediately. I believe that is what the British government has already said that they are about to do, which is excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be taking a leading role globally, to ensure that landmines are banned, and we have always believed that. We should be pursuing a ban through the pro&hyphen;ban country forum known as the Ottawa process. Canada has taken a leading role on this and has done a lot of work on this, and we should be supporting Canada in this. I do not understand why we are not. It is not as if we have antipersonnel landmines as any integral part of what we might need to defend this country. We could not do it. It is just a silly argument. We do not have enough to defend ourselves with them. There is no reason for us to have them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that antipersonnel landmines do is keep fighting after the war is over. They are the only little soldiers who do not understand that the war is finished. The vast majority of people who are injured, killed and destroyed for life&mdash;whether they are dead or not&mdash;are the people who go out into the fields. They are children, women, farmers and people who are non&hyphen;combatant. The vast majority of people who are affected by antipersonnel landmines in the world today are non&hyphen;combatants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no reason why we should maintain our large stockpile of antipersonnel landmines. There is no reason why we should not take a leading role in getting rid of these vicious, useless, abhorrent weapons, and there is no reason why we should not be supporting Canada in the Ottawa process in the pro&hyphen;ban country forum. They are doing a very good job on this. Landmines are one of the most iniquitous weapons still available in the world today. Everybody thought they had disappeared, but they have come back with a gigantic, spectacular, appalling vengeance and are carrying out that vengeance to an incredibly large extent on innocent people all over the world even as we speak.

I have seen the effects they have on machinery, equipment and vehicles; I have seen the effect they have on people; I have seen the effect they have had on animals; and I have experienced them personally. This is an issue which is right. Its time is right. The arguments are clearly understood. Landmines are not like bullets. As soon as the bullet is fired, its work is done. Landmines go on year after year, sometimes decade after decade, and they move from the combatant and non&hyphen;combatant field to the purely non&hyphen;combatant field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add my personal plea that the Senate accord with this motion. I would remind senators that what we are talking about here, in my view, should be cross&hyphen;party agreement on an issue which matters fundamentally to humanity. It is my view that what we require from the government in this issue yet again is some political will, some political leadership and some political courage. This is a government which is very outspoken on economic matters. It is time you started to be outspoken on human rights and fundamental issues of peace in our world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore add my voice to those who call for a total ban on landmines and the immediate destruction by the government of its stockpile of antipersonnel landmines. The government should take a leading role globally to ensure that landmines are banned and it should support the Ottawa process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support the motion. The government does support a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel landmines and the unilateral suspension on the operational use of antipersonnel landmines by the Australian defence forces. The government supports the Conference on Disarmament as the negotiating principal forum for a global ban.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is currently leading a major push to start negotiations in this forum. The Conference on Disarmament has proved that it can produce treaties which are comprehensive in scope and which can achieve the adherence of all relevant states&mdash;for example, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The government is also participating in the series of Ottawa process meetings this year and hopes this process will prove complementary to work in the Conference on Disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also focusing on tackling the humanitarian disaster caused by landmines. The calls for destruction of Australian stockpiles are, in this context, somewhat misplaced, because the Australian Defence Force stocks are used for training and research purposes only, notably for the training which has been essential to enable our army engineers to participate in mine clearance programs&mdash;for example, in Cambodia. Senator Carr and Senator Bourne both made reference to this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I got that interjection, Senator Murray, but I refer you to the motion which talks about destroying the stockpile of antipersonnel landmines. It makes no provisions whatsoever for landmines which will be required for the training purposes which are so essential. The suspension in the operational use of antipersonnel landmines by the ADF is indefinite and would be reviewed only in the case of substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances in which Australia's security was under threat and the denial of an anti&hyphen;personnel landmines capability of the ADF would result in additional Australian casualties and damage to vital infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government continues to give priority to those measures which will make the great est practical difference to the victims of the misuse of landmines. The total Australian contribution to the de&hyphen;mining process announced since March 1996 is $18 million, and it makes Australia a world leader in the de&hyphen;mining process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions in this very important debate. I would like to say something to Senator Parer about stockpiling. There are people who are still concerned about training. Some people think the implications are that we could still use landmines for training in the placing of landmines. It is not as clear as it could be that the training is only for de&hyphen;mining purposes. There is still a concern within the community that training might be for a future need to show our military how to put them out. But a few hundred landmines to be used in terms of de&hyphen;mining training does not, in my opinion, constitute a stockpile. A stockpile, from my understanding, is what we have at the moment&mdash;which is a very large number of landmines&mdash;and I do not think there is ever an excuse to hold onto those just in case we might need them. That is clearly what this motion is saying and clearly what the speakers have said today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues are human issues. If anything other than the strongest approach is considered to be acceptable, members of the government should speak in as much detail as they can to those people who are currently experiencing the horror of living the uncertainty in a country where they cannot farm their own land, live in their houses or understand whether they are going to survive the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely urgent, it is extremely important. If the government can move just this step further in relation to its own policies it would find that it had a great deal of support within the Australian community and, indeed, the international community. What was considered to be a hopelessly utopian approach just a couple of years ago by the former minister is now gaining huge international support. So here is the chance for this government to act with strength and with a real level of honour in relation to what we would like to see in the world in the future. It should not ever be seen as a matter of military strategy. It is those people who know most about military strategy who know about the lunacy of continuing to use land mines. But it is not just a matter of military strategy;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is a matter of taking strong and right action and taking it now. I urge the Senate's support for this motion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of technical and minor policy amendments to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991. These amendments proposed in this bill support this Government's regulatory reform agenda as they help the Authority take control of its business and prioritise its agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australia New Zealand Food Authority is a Commonwealth statutory authority which develops uniform food standards for Australia and New Zealand and undertakes related functions. It operates under a unique Commonwealth, New Zealand, State and Territory partnership arrangement based upon a 1991 cooperative agreement in Australia and a 1995 treaty with New Zealand. These arrangements see standards, developed through the Authority's statutory processes, uniformly adopted by reference and without amendment into State, Territory and New Zealand laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments seek to facilitate the cooperative arrangement between the governments and at the same time, retain the community consultation, accountability, openness, transparency and timeliness which characterise the Authority's operations. They give the Authority greater flexibility in its operations, simply and clarify its procedures, and confer powers appropriate to a modem statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments have a long history. They have been proposed in a number of internal and external reviews of the Authority's processes over a number of years. While they are essentially administrative house-keeping, they are important in giving effect to this government's commitment to its regulatory reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms in this bill, while relatively minor, will smooth the way for the Authority as it undertakes its important regulatory reform program over the next few
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. The amendments are about simplicity and clarity. They are about flexibility and modem management. They streamline, and replace prescription with guidance. They support better government. These are matters which this government will continue to hold dear.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion that is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  Senator Brown seeks to amend, as I understand it, in a fairly substantial manner. My office was notified of this a couple of hours or so ago. But I have been engaged in other things. I have not had a chance to look at it. I think honourable senators who are placing notices of motion before the chamber should give other senators the chance of having a look at matters that come before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole practice of giving notice one day and trying to get the matter formal the next day or the day after that or the day after that is becoming a farce. I believe that these notices of motion and the motions that are going through this parliament like a sausage machine are devaluing the decisions of the Senate. People are just getting up here and giving notices of motion. I think there were 10 or so notices of motion given today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I could spend all my time looking at these notices of motion and judging whether or not the motions should be adopted or whether they should not be adopted, but I have more to do with my time than that because there is legislation coming before this parliament. The major function of this parliament is to consider legislation. It is getting a bit rough when it comes down to individual senators such as me very often deciding whether these motions are adopted or whether they are not. I am getting to the stage now where I think I will not vote on any of them; I will just walk out of the chamber until such time as people have the decency to realise that, if they continue piling up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> with notices of motion, they can have it on their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not denying that many of these things are very important issues. The last one was of considerable importance and it had been of considerable interest to me for a considerable period of time. But, fair crack of the whip! I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and my very hard&hyphen;working staff are overloaded at this time. We get people coming along with these notices of motion on all sorts of things, asking that they be called formal. Therefore, one does not have the chance to consider the opposing argument to the particular proposition.

They have huge resources to say whether or not these motions fit within their policies. I do not.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">To me this is an extremely important motion. We have a leader of the Ogoni people from Nigeria, Komene Famaa, in this city and in this parliament today. We have 19 of his fellow Ogoni people languishing in a gaol in Nigeria facing summary execution. Ken Saro-Wiwa, an outspoken leader of the Ogoni people, and seven of his fellow community leaders were summarily executed, even while the CHOGM meeting took place in New Zealand two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is an appeal to the Senate to give some impetus to Australia's need to stand with the Ogoni people against the Abacha regime military dictatorship in Nigeria which has these 19 Ogoni leaders existing in despicable conditions in gaol with the threat of summary execution over their heads simply because they have stood up for democracy, social justice and the environment of their homeland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine says that we should have the decency not to bring forward such motions. What an extraordinary contribution to the national discourse. What a call to deny issues as we elected representatives see them being brought into this Senate for proper debate. Senator Harradine has the temerity to say that he wants to get on with the government  schedule&mdash;that is, to consider legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have news for Senator Harradine. He is not going to set my agenda. He is not going to eliminate from the agenda of this Senate the matters which the people whom I represent in this Australian and Tasmanian constituency feel are important. He might have his schedule dictated by the Howard government, but the Greens are not going to because there is much more to the national interest and to the Tasmanian interest&mdash;and, indeed, as in this case, to the international interest&mdash;than would be set by the very constrictive,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arch-conservative view of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that Senator Harradine is stressed by the workload. I empathise with him there. But if he had spoken to me, he would have known that I am happy to make a joint approach to the government that we do get the adequate staffing to enable him to deal with the same workload that I am dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, I make an appeal to the Senate to consider the urgency of this matter. We have another Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting coming up in Britain a little way down the line. It is important that Australia makes a very clear stand on this in the coming months as an indication to the Commonwealth of nations that there is an international obligation to take it up to the Abacha regime&mdash;this cruel dictatorship in Nigeria, responsible to no-one. Unfortunately, it is a place used to doing business with the Shell oil corporation. It has caused so much of the opposition from the Ogoni people because it is their homeland that Shell has been operating in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seeing there has been no action by the Abacha regime to do the right thing for the Ogoni people, hopefully we will see a stand at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to expel that regime from the Commonwealth and to move our Australian consulate to one of the west African countries which have a more decent view, to use Senator Harradine's adjective, of the way human affairs should be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is an urgent matter. I ask the Senate to endorse it and to give Mr Famaa, as he continues his tour of this country, moral support that he can send back home to the Ogoni people, in particular to those 19 patriots of the Ogoni people who are languishing in General Abacha's cruel, inhumane prison conditions. </PARA></SPEECH>

I think it is important that Senator Brown tries to sort these things out outside, where possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe this is urgent. I believe that the urgency of the car industry obviously is important, but I would like to say it was the Labor government who pushed through the Uruguay Round of GATT and the implications of tariff reductions and they did not think it was urgent then. So I am very pleased to see they now see industry policy as urgent and that issues involving human beings and their jobs are urgent in relation to tariffs, but I could not get them to see that as urgent in terms of those issues when they were pushing through the Uruguay Round of GATT despite the warnings of many people in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the urgency today relates to especially paragraph 5(b), which calls on the Senate President to write to the British Secretary of State and Community Affairs expressing the Senate's grave concern about the treatment of the Ogoni people. Just maybe that will save the lives of those 19 Ogoni people facing execution. That is something that we as a Senate can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge those people who are here to think about it themselves. If the Senate is unable to consider that this is urgent enough for us to call on the Senate President to do this, perhaps there is some other means by which the Senate can sign a letter to do this. Maybe we could take this opportunity, if the Labor Party do actually believe this is important, to circulate a letter amongst members of the Senate to sign&mdash;maybe even some members of the government who believe it is important will sign it as well&mdash;and just maybe we will be able to save these people's lives.

In fact, today the committee saw the representative of the Ogoni people. I was not able to be there because a matter being dealt with this morning came down to my vote, unfortunately. But let me say this to Senator Brown: the real work for the human rights of people, including the Ogoni people, is done in the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Obviously I could not give away that particular commitment. I do not intend to because I believe it is very important to have that commitment to human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>

He and Senator Margetts may cover a lot, but I am on my own covering the all the portfolios and all of the matters that come before this chamber. It is just impossible to be across all of these motions that come up without time being given for people to look at them. We are asked to declare them formal when we cannot hear the debate for and against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion I am simply saying that I have not been able to even look at the amendment.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The car industry in Australia is the cornerstone of Australia's entire manufacturing sector. Our manufacturing industries are built around the fact that this country has a viable car manufacturing industry and in one way or another in the traditional sense most of our manufacturing sector relates in some form to that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia makes good cars and Australians drive cars made in Australia, in the majority. Our cars these days are of high quality, often of Australian design and increasingly competitive in price. This is a good industry for this nation. It employs directly and indirectly  295,000 people both in the car manufacturing companies themselves&mdash;the big four, as they are known&mdash;and in the 200 component part manufacturers that supply equipment to the car manufacturers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry that has the potential to create another 10,000 jobs in this nation by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3914"> the year 2005. It is an export industry for Australia, too. Exports have increased for this industry from almost zero 15 years ago to something close to $1 billion these days. It is an industry that attracts investment. Under the last several years of the Labor administration of this country, Toyota invested $800 million in new plant at Altona. General Motors Holden's has invested over $260 million. Mitsubishi put in an investment of $600 million and Ford announced a commitment of a $1 billion investment in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is about giving this vital and central industry to Australia certainty about its future&mdash;certainty so that it can be kept growing, certainty so that it can be kept exporting and certainty so that it can be kept in Australia. This motion gives this chamber a simple choice: we can vote for or against the Australian automotive industry, the companies involved and the jobs they represent.</PARA>

The issues about the Australian car industry are well known. It is important, though, that the Senate speak to this urgency motion today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party have consulted widely in this industry, something we have continued doing in opposition as we did in government, and we have announced a plan for the future development of the Australian automotive industry. It is a plan which involves a freeze on tariffs at at least 15 per cent until the year 2005. It is a plan which involves a review of the industry's position to determine the assistance needed beyond 2005, taking into full account, of course, the impact on regional Australia and the progress of our trading partners in their reducing their barriers to trade. It is a plan which involves the continuation of the export facilitation scheme, or a similar such effective scheme, of the duty&hyphen;free allowance and of more support for research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put down this plan, made it public and attracted widespread community support&mdash;support from workers in the industry and support from the industry itself. Indeed, industry has responded to the points we have raised by saying that, if such a plan were adopted in Australia, it would double the amount of motor vehicle exports to 100,000 units within the time span of our plan; it would triple the component part exports of the automotive industry to lift it to the value of at least $3 billion; and 10,000 new jobs would be created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have called for a bipartisan approach to this industry so that the future of this industry will not be determined every three years, parliament to parliament; so that there is a long distance perspective; and so that the  industry can plan its restructure effectively so it remains world competitive and a viable exporter. The response to our approach has been overwhelming from industry, as I have said, from state governments and from the community. But I believe, and so does the ALP, that the federal government needs to be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3915"> forced to act on this issue. The Howard government flip&hyphen;flops around on it. Most recently, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, over cigars and port at the Commonwealth Club, asked the question, `Why don't we just let Mitsubishi go?'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the government to oppose the motion proposed by Senator Cook. It is amazing, really, that a former minister, a minister in a previous government and who knows proper process, should bring forward this urgency motion today about the car industry and the future of tariffs in the car industry when he knows the matter is going through proper process&mdash;when he and the Labor opposition know that the Industry Commission is due to report this week or thereabouts and that the matter has not yet been considered by cabinet nor by the party and is going to go through proper process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is nothing but a political stunt. This is not a debate for or against the car industry. All of us here are in support of the car industry in Australia. In fact, quite a few of us on the back bench have been around visiting the plants in recent times and are very appreciative of the work that they have done in lifting their game, improving their efficiency and exporting out of Australia. They are continuing to do that. We cannot debate that here tonight. Tonight we are really talking about process. This is nothing but a stunt brought forward by Senator Cook. It is really a waste of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the Senate of the reference that was given by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to the Industry Commission late last year. The reference is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's desire to encourage the development of a sustainable, prosperous and internationally
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitive automotive manufacturing industry in Australia; to improve the overall economic performance of the Australian automotive industry; to provide good quality, competitively priced vehicles to the Australian consumer; and its commitment to abide by Australia's international obligations and commitments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commission consider how the Australian automotive industry will evolve within a world trading environment through the next decade, and that the Commission consider APEC developments on market liberalisation, and the timing and extent of cost reductions from other microeconomic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has not made any policy decision on this matter and will not do so&mdash;and cannot do so&mdash;until the Industry Commission delivers its final report, which is expected later this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is determined to provide a stable policy environment in which the automotive companies can undertake major investment decisions with confidence. The Productivity Commission is but one source of advice on this matter, and the government is consulting widely, particularly through the Automotive Manufacturing Council, as part of its policy development process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In establishing arrangements for the automotive industry after the year 2000, the government will consider a range of factors affecting the structure of the industry, including the strong growth in import penetration over recent years, the actions of competitor countries and, most importantly, the progress of the Australian industry itself towards developing a global niche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Labor leaders favour a pause in tariffs and a review prior to resuming their reductions while also insisting that we maintain our commitments to APEC&mdash;which, after all, we are locked into by former Prime Minister Keating. I would like to ask senators opposite to outline how these contradictory objectives can be achieved. They might care to indicate how certainty can be maintained for the purposes of planning investments in the industry. They might also specify the modifications they think necessary to ensure that the export facilitation scheme remains consistent with our WTO obligations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3916">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the opposition there is quite a range of views. I will quote from some statements made by Mr Lindsay Tanner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we must avoid becoming economically irrational, lapsing into mindless populism, recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we don't like. If we adopt such a stance we will be virtually indistinguishable from Pauline Hanson on economic issues. We should not delude ourselves that there is no link between her virulent racism and economic nostalgia. The two are very closely related, and difficult to separate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further warns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`There is a danger, however, that Labor will allow tariffs to resume the unduly dominant role they played in industry policy in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We cannot . . . return to the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again there is a serious risk that Labor will become a prisoner of the populist nostalgia such as that peddled by Pauline Hanson. It confirms the deep divisions within the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Saturday night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Show</EMPHASIS>, John Button, a previous Labor minister for industry, was quizzed about policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, people talk about what the Government should do about industry policy. I don't think the Government should do very much about industry policy. What it should do a lot about . . . in a country this size, is strategic policy, you know, thinking about strategies for wealth generation, community development and so on, in the next decade&mdash;not now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat, `strategies for wealth generation, community development and so on in the next decade'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we as a government done? First of all, before we can say anything about our achievements in getting wealth generation and the development of the Australian economy under way, we need to remind the Senate and listeners where we have come from. What happened with the previous Keating government? Taxes were up 30 per cent in the last four years of the Keating government. Debt was up $70 billion in the last four years of the Keating government. There was $9 billion worth of assets realised. The whole lot was spent. Because all this was hiding behind the facade of cash accounting, the community were not made aware of this huge build-up in debt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when we came to government last year we inherited a deficit&mdash;a loss, in other words&mdash;from the previous government of $10.3 billion. We have set in train via the budget process&mdash;through the second budget and forward estimates for next year&mdash;a situation where we expect to be in surplus by $1.6 billion at the end of the financial year after this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a huge turnaround in Commonwealth government activity. Instead of big spending, creating debt and cutting down on savings, we have turned that all around and are indicating that we are going to be in surplus. Hence the government will be a saver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened as a consequence of that? We have had a huge change in the interest rate regime in Australia. Not only has the short-term rate come down enormously, but so has the long&hyphen;term rate. The 10&hyphen;year bond rate has come down; the whole lot has come down. On top of that again, the risk premium on 10&hyphen;year bonds relative to the USA was 2&half; per cent 2&half; years ago in the middle of the Keating regime. It is down about one per cent now, so we are regarded by the world as a much less risky place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are on about encouraging sustained economic growth in order to get investment. We need the investment to sustain the economic growth&mdash;that is where the jobs come from. Recent results have shown that there has been a big growth in investment in the last 12 months. We are on about sustaining that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made a commitment to look urgently at the matter of assistance for and cooperation with the car industry. We are great supporters of the car industry, as all Australians are, and we disagree with Senator Cook's motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also accept that you are not a naive person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not deal with each other as you two deal with each other, Senator McGauran. The Australian Democrats are strongly opposed to the speed and depth of the cuts in tariffs, quotas and bounties which have been to date enthusiastically advocated and implemented with the support of both of Australia's large parties and the minor National Party. These cuts have gone well beyond what Australia is obliged to do under the World Trade Organisation, and they have been undertaken without similar measures by our trading partners, who continue to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protect their industries by keeping out Australian manufactured products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the useful things this government has done through its Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, is pay far more attention to bilateral arrangements as opposed to multilateral arrangements. Bilateral arrangements do mean paying attention to what individual trading partners are up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian manufacturers and workers have deliberately been placed at a disadvantage to overseas employers operating with strong tariff and non-tariff assistance. Both of Australia's major parties finally agree that tariffs should only be reduced in future on a quid pro quo basis. Yet unilateral tariff reductions are still legislated until the year 2000 for the two major industries affected by tariffs, industries which directly employ tens of thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of tariff assistance for the car industry is set to fall from the present 22&half; per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000. These reductions are set to take place irrespective of what our trading partners do and irrespective of their impact on employment and investment in Australia. Our view is simple. If it is not acceptable to have unilateral reductions after the year 2000, why on earth is it acceptable to have them now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament is now preparing to decide tariff rates beyond the year 2000 for the car industry. The major parties have indicated that tariff reductions on a nothing for nothing basis are not good enough after the year 2000. We welcome this announcement&mdash;the Democrats are pleased with that&mdash;but we believe we can and we should go further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position, and it has been so for many a year, is that tariff cuts should cease immediately. Australia must no longer proceed with tariff reductions further than what is required under multilateral and bilateral agreements unless our trading partners do likewise and also address their use of non-tariff barriers.  So&hyphen;called unilateral disarmament must cease immediately, not just after the year 2000 as the ALP is advocating and as the coalition has suggested.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3918">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the programmed tariff cuts from December 1996 to the year 2000 will cost $2 billion in lost revenue, so the government will forgo $2 billion which it would otherwise have earned. We believe that, if tariffs were frozen, the resultant saving should be ploughed into industrial development programs targeted at generating jobs and export opportunities. So we are not suggesting that the money should not be put to a good economic purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out, however, that we do not believe tariff reductions are inherently either a good thing or a bad thing. It is the unilateral reduction, without equivalent cuts by our major trading competitors, which permanently damages Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been engaged in trade liberalisation negotiations and should continue with that. However, further trade reductions must only occur if reciprocal trade liberalisations are pursued by our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well understood that we have done far more than our fair share of tariff reductions compared to our global competitors and often, regrettably, at enormous social cost. Unlike the Labor Party, the Democrats do not believe we need to wait until the year 2000 before we adopt a more strategic and tenacious approach to trade policy. We are unashamedly interventionists. This should be adopted now while we still have tariff rates which put us in a good bargaining position, and this is imperative now because the car industry directly employs 22,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Liberal, Labor and National parties are to this date fundamentally opposed to reviewing these decisions. They are open to negotiate tariffs after the year 2000. By then, however, it may already be too late. Car manufacturers, for example, are already struggling to sustain market share, both domestic and export, under current tariffs of 22&half; per cent. Imports have risen strongly as tariffs have declined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imports accounted for only 24 per cent of vehicle sales in 1990, which was only seven years ago. Now they account for 46 per cent of sales and industry leaders expect they will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reach 70 per cent by the year 2000 when tariffs will have fallen to 15 per cent. So they will have jumped from 24 per cent to 70 per cent in 10 years&mdash;a threefold increase in imports directly as a result of this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, our Asia-Pacific trading partners, while committed to lower tariffs in theory, show little sign of actually reducing them. Indonesia recently launched a national car project enjoying large government subsidies and tax concessions. Thailand and Malaysia maintain protective barriers of more than 200 per cent, Indonesia levies a flat 100 per cent, Singapore charges 45 per cent and South Korea, which has a tariff on car imports of only eight per cent, keeps imports low through non-tariff barriers such as complex audit requirements and sales tax on imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level playing field is clearly a myth. Other countries ensure their industries are not at a disadvantage from imports. It is about time Australia did the same. In Australia the path of reform has been predictable and has been disastrous for jobs, national debt and Australian ownership. It needs to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Year after year, the Industry Commission, now the Productivity Commission, has held public inquiries into different industries, or aspects of industry policy, followed by draft and final reports. What they have effectively been doing is charting the decline of many of our best industries. They have selectively interpreted the evidence provided and advocated reforms which have paid little heed to what our trading partners are doing. The danger is that the same fate will fall upon the car industry. Australian governments have been victims of naive, ideological, academic, theoretical and overtrusting advice. We need to inject a healthy dose of self&hyphen;interest and hard bargaining into our trade negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our industries and jobs have been exposed, and we have received little in return. Tariff cuts have led to job losses as firms have scaled down operations, closed altogether or moved overseas. Just recently, Mitsubishi  closed its truck operation. Some gains have been registered, and we recognise these, but these have typically been in other sectors of the economy and have not compensated the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3919"> losers sufficiently&mdash;and the losers are the Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of approach to trade liberalisation will lead to disaster. We should only agree to open our markets if our trading partners do likewise and match us. Failure to do so will simply result in the further decimation of Australian industries and the further erosion of thousands more jobs, or the loss of those jobs to add to those already sacrificed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few remarks on this motion moved by Senator Cook, and I do so in the context of what is occurring in the remainder of the world. World trade patterns are well established and well understood. Indeed, if one examines the trends, there has been little variation in world trade patterns over the last 100 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are relatively simple. World trade is growing in both volume terms and value terms. In respect of commodities, which Australia is an expert at producing and exporting, there is growth in both volumes of commodities traded and volumes of commodities sold. However, there is significant decline in the value terms, and this decline is significant, longstanding and ongoing. There is no suggestion in the figures of any reversal to this unfortunate trend of lower and lower real prices for commodities. In respect of Australia, this means by definition that we need to sell a lot more wool, coal, grains, ore and the like simply to receive last year's dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of manufactures and services, the growth is in both volume and value received for these products on world markets. Importantly, there is significant growth in the value received for those manufactures and services, and this will continue to grow almost in exponential terms as more and more countries develop and their consumer societies have a more disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a country that switches or changes its export base from commodities to manufactures and services is doing the right thing to improve its standard of living and to improve its relative position compared to other nations. To our immediate north, as most senators know, a number of countries&mdash;Singapore,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan&mdash;have dramatically improved their living standards over the last 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Common features of all those countries 30 years ago, or at the predevelopment stage, were poor literacy standards, often less than 50 per cent, non-existent infrastructure, low quality public health, low educational standards, economic domination by foreign interests and a low to non-existent domestic capital basis. All of those countries shifted their populations from relative poverty to relative prosperity, and they are still raising aggregate living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those huge shifts in living standards are achieved through an emphasis on a number of factors&mdash;that is, sound macro&hyphen;economic policies resulting in low interest rates, often negative; low inflation; free movement of capital; a sound currency, which is often undervalued; an emphasis on the allocation of scarce resources to education, health, infrastructure and agriculture; and, finally, and most importantly, a central coordinating role to guide firms through the development and implementation of industry policies in key areas of the economy. Those industries changed over time, but the key element of all the industry policies in most of those countries was movement up the value chain based upon an export orientation; hence they nurtured, protected and grew key industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key industry that contributed to the growth of national wealth of most developing and most developed countries is, and will continue for the foreseeable future to be, the auto industry. In that context, the motion before us today is quite modest. It makes no reference to state ownership, state control or state development. It seeks really only three things: firstly, to maintain tariffs at almost the lowest level in the world; secondly, to implement transparent measures to ensure our domestic industry is compared accurately with competitors; and, thirdly, a continuation of domestic schemes that are consistent with World Trade Organisation obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seeks the maintenance of a viable, world&hyphen;class, export oriented, domestic&hyphen;based auto manufacturing industry. It seeks this because
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3920"> this country has no other option if it wishes to maintain current aggregate high standards of living for the entire population. It seeks this because our current trading volumes are not sufficient to generate the necessary amounts of foreign currency to fund our huge import bill. That import bill, in the two key industries of automobiles and IT, will blow out by around $30 billion per annum over the next 20 years. If we do not produce enough domestic vehicles and we continue to import at current levels, our import bill&mdash;our current account&mdash;will blow out from something in the order of $7 billion to $30 billion in the automobile industry in the next 30 years. The same scenario applies in the IT industry except the projected deficit there is much worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot grow sufficient product or dig enough holes to fund that deficit. Iron ore, gold, silver, gas, coal, LNG and LPG are all basic commodities. Australia, as a supplier, is a price taker. The purchaser decides both the volume and the price and, if either are not adequate from this country, he has many other sources to go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way to avoid declining relative living standards is through the implementation of industry policies in a range of key industries. Those industry policies should have a number of features. They should be export orientated; value added with capacity to move up the value chain; benchmarked towards international best practice in competitive terms; and they should build up our comparative advantage of a literate, numerate mobile population. They need to be heavily reliant on technology and renewing technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian car industry, because of the major structural changes that have been introduced over the last 15 years and that continue to be introduced in a range of plants around Australia, is noted for all of these features. There are now high value producing units, becoming more and more export orientated. All of the key firms benchmark their labour and production practices to international best practice. They regularly introduce new and modern technology.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion seeks to encourage the further development of that industry.

I listened with interest to Senator Bishop's comments to see whether he was ever going to talk about the car industry, which seems to be the way that the motion was framed in general. But, in fact, Senator Bishop talked in general about industry policies. I want to talk specifically about some of the things that are noted in this motion that has been moved by Senator Cook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is on the record as saying that it is committed to the development of strong and viable manufacturing industries. The car industry is no exception. That is why the Productivity Commission's terms of reference were framed in that way. The terms of reference requested the commission to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have regard to the government's desire to encourage the development of a sustainable, prosperous and internationally competitive automotive manufacturing industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The terms of reference also requested the commission to have regard to the economic, social, environmental and regional development objectives of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can just imagine the hue and cry from the former government if we had brought forward an urgency motion like this, just prior to the release of a report that they had commissioned and one that they had not responded to. I can just imagine Senator Cook, in his day as a minister, if we had come up with this sort of a stunt to try to debate an issue just prior to the commission releasing its report and the government commenting on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is now waiting for the final report of the Productivity Commission and we will be following standard practice&mdash;standard since June 1993&mdash;in relation to reports, where the government considers the report and also determines the timing of the release of that  report. That is a practice that you started in 1993 and continued to follow, Senator Cook.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3921"> I am quite sure that had we been in your position and you in ours&mdash;which you will not be for some time&mdash;you would have screamed blue murder if we had put up a motion like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note how your position has changed on the issue of tariffs. I could not quite believe it but you probably need reminding of one or two things that some of your former ministers said&mdash;Martin Ferguson, for instance, the shadow minister for industrial relations. In 1991, the day after the then government's 1991 industry statement, which included tariff cuts, TCF unions&mdash;which many of you are familiar with&mdash;alleged that further tariff reductions or reforms would lead to job losses. But what was Martin Ferguson's response? He endorsed the tariff reduction policy saying, `It's all about investment in the long&hyphen;term future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator Gareth Evans, now the shadow Treasurer, made a ministerial statement on 12 March 1991. What did he say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is further tariff reduction . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self&hyphen;interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism . . . Worse still, tariffs are a regressive burden&mdash;that is, the poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the policy of the Labor Party and even more the policy of Senator Murray and the Democrats. Senator Murray is going to ensure that the poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest&mdash;the words from then Senator Gareth Evans in 1991, when his government deliberately and determinedly set about pulling down the tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now look at Labor's record on tariff reductions, particularly in relation to the car industry. In 1984, shortly after Labor came to office, car production in Australia stood at around 370,000 units. When they left office in 1996, production was just 314,000 units. In the interim, Nissan had closed down production and Australia had largely lost the capacity to produce small cars like the Ford Laser. I think there was only one remaining small
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> car, the Toyota Corolla, being made in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This under Labor Party policy and Labor government policy. This is the policy that they put in place and they now have the hide to say that we have a large increase in the number of imported vehicles in Australia. Let me tell you that there is one reason why they are imported. It is because the Button plan, when it was put into place, did not read the signs all that well and had underestimated the growth in the small car market. It said that if you could not produce 30,000 vehicles of any one model, then you could no longer make that model in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the demand for small cars has meant that there is no alternative but to have imported vehicles in that range. There is no alternative directly because of the plans that were put in place by the Button car plan and endorsed by the then Labor government. I am quite sure that Senator Murray may not have endorsed that program even at that time because if he had his way we might still have tariffs at 45 per cent. But then again, if we did, Senator Murray, remember that would be hurting the poorest Australians much more than those who are well off. In 1984 import penetration was 20 per cent. As a result of your policies, it was 50 per cent in 1996. That is because of your policies. Under Labor, employment in the industry declined from around 70,000 to around 45,000. Do not blame us for that.</PARA>

That is why we now have

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission's draft report on the automotive industry noted that progress had been especially slow in labour market reform, government regulations and in the economic infrastructure supporting the industry, especially the waterfront, shipping and rail transport. This government has set in train a comprehensive process to review the post&hyphen;2000 arrangements for the car industry. The Productivity Commission has its terms of reference and it has produced a draft report which has been commented on at length in the interim.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Points (d) and (e) relate to the continuation of the export facilitation scheme and the duty&hyphen;free allowance scheme. I point out to Senator Cook that these two schemes have survived two very tough budgets from this government. Industry should have the necessary confidence that these schemes have survived two very tough budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inconsistency in Senator Cook's thinking should be noted. It should be noted that the schemes were introduced to reinforce the process of tariff reduction. You cannot have it both ways. If you are talking about a freeze on tariffs, it is fair enough to say that these
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schemes must then come under review because they were put in place to facilitate a reduction in tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, there are other ways and other schemes, such as a reduction in the wholesale sales tax. That has been one of the ideas floated and it may well trump your pathetic second car plan&mdash;the Cook plan. You may well be trumped after the Productivity Commission report next week, Senator Cook. What are you going to do then? The whole point is that this government supports the integrity of the two schemes mentioned in points (d) and (e).</PARA>

What is so galling about this is that, under Labor's so&hyphen;called `clever country' policies, Australian business R&amp;D expenditure slipped from a very high ranking within the OECD down to 18 out of 24. Time does not permit me to mention that the R&amp;D syndication rorts, which you never picked up on, were right under your noses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very important report and it would have been great if we could have had it before it was tabled, so that we could make a more intelligent response. As always with these reports, because we do not have it before us much before the tabling of it, we labour under a disadvantage. I wanted to comment on a number of things that are in the report&mdash;particularly the discussion about drought&mdash;and to underline some of the Democrats' concerns about the report and the direction the government is taking in drought funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things happening next week is another meeting of ARMCANZ. I hope that next week ARMCANZ will reconsider the proposal to drop drought exceptional circumstances from the planned new national drought policy. This is absolutely critical. Once again, farmers wonder what on earth this government is doing, having been elected on a sort of slogan of being the friend of farmers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with dropping drought exceptional circumstances&mdash;unless the new policy, when we get it, has something in it that has not been signalled&mdash;is that we are dropping a trigger that people can use when there is a drought to get the government to respond to their situation. The Senate will remember that the previous Labor government dropped the definition of drought under the heading of `natural disaster'&mdash;I believe that was a retrograde step&mdash;and put in place the drought exceptional circumstances program to enable farmers and state and regional governments to trigger aid when there is a drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that if we do not regard drought as a natural disaster but as an exceptional circumstance and then drop that, we are saying, `Well, there is no drought really. It is just something that happens. And when it happens, we can address the problem.' It do not think that is good enough; it is letting down our farmers. I hope that, in its national drought policy, the government will address this and have put in place something to replace drought exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, farmers and state and local governments, whenever a drought occurs, are going to have to come cap in hand to Canberra and beg for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drought in Australia is not something which is exceptional. It is something which is part of the cycle of our climate, and that is why I believe the government needs to take account of this. I note that several drought stricken shires around Australia are due to lose their drought relief next month. I am concerned that, although those shires may have had some rain, they are still a long way from recovery and many have not had any crop at all yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, in speaking to this report, I call on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, to extend drought exceptional circumstances funding from 10 June&mdash;the date it is due to run out&mdash;until the government's planned new integrated rural policy is implemented, because there is going to be a gap there which could be quite serious. I see the parliamentary secretary, Senator  Brownhill, shaking his head. I take that as a reassurance, which I think will be a great
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3925"> relief to those farmers who are affected. I hope that Senator Brownhill actually puts something on the record as well; I think that would help. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to take note of the report that has been tabled, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand: Record and Resolutions</EMPHASIS> . This report not only sets out the record and resolutions of the ninth meeting of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council but it also raises issues of considerable interest to the Australian Democrats. The agrifood business is particularly important to Australia, and this document brings together a number of matters on which I have already expressed my views. I will take this opportunity to set out some of those concerns again and link them with the resolutions of this particular meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environmental issues are central to our future and we must recognise the need, as the Australian Democrats certainly do, for sustainable development. The government has a role in leading Australian agribusiness into the next century. How we position ourselves now will, of course, have important consequences for the future. The report card is five, 10 or at least 20 years down the track, when it will be too late to make the changes to catch up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can be addressed and hopefully averted by smart agricultural practices but this does require a commitment from the government to fund research and development addressing these concerns. I think that funding of research is the key to wealth generation and lifestyle in the future. It is an investment and not a cost and the returns are long term. Agribusiness has been one of the beneficiaries of Australian research and development in the past, and it has a major role to play in our future as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document is particularly relevant because it recognises the link between environmental, economic and social issues and sustainable development and highlights the problems for which research and development may provide answers&mdash;problems such as water treatment and waste water management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern addressed by this document, which I would like to comment on, is the development of uniform food safety and hygiene standards. I noticed that this particular meeting resolved to develop the concept of a national safe food system, which I find particularly encouraging. This will have a local effect or perhaps a local benefit in Australia, helping to ensure consumers that the food that they eat and the food that they buy is safe to eat. It will also have benefits for the export of Australian food, which is dependent upon Australian food being safe to eat, and the recent bans on Australia beef in Indonesia and in Korea are strong reminders of this fact, and an illustration of the consequences of food contamination on Australia export trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must not compromise consumer safety by penny pinching and we have seen a number of positions lost through rationalisation in the very agencies that deal with health and safety matters. This is affecting the ability of these agencies to cooperate with state and territory authorities for inspection, development and enforcement of standards, review of the food standards code and the development of the food hygiene standards. These are important issues and the consequences of funding cuts in these areas and at this level, I believe, are considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say that, at this time, a move to self&hyphen;regulation and away from all the present standards may not achieve the high safety standards that consumers expect and have every right to expect, nor will it necessarily protect our trade. These are important issues and I hope that the government will take these matters into consideration when developing its policy and legislation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a half hour or so ago we had an urgency motion moved in this place on car tariffs which drew attention to issues that the speaker said would save the jobs of an important section of the Australian industry. Tonight I would like to talk about an equally important Australian industry and one that has the potential to create far more jobs in this country than perhaps any other industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market for food in Asia is growing at some $16 billion every year. We export around five times more food than we import. Put together, these two simple facts provide Australia with an enormous opportunity and a significant challenge. Australia must&mdash;and I am optimistic that it will&mdash;capitalise on the huge market for food products in Asia, just a couple of hours away by aircraft, literally on our doorsteps. This recognition of the great opportunity for our food exports into Asia is the impetus behind the governments's `Supermarket to Asia' strategy, which is the cornerstone of our efforts to achieve a competitive Australian agrifood industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that around 200,000 Australians are employed in the largest manufacturing industry in this country, that is, the food processing industry. Retail sales and exports in this sector of the economy are valued at $64 billion. Food exports in 1995-96 were worth $15 billion&mdash;an enormous amount of money. Approximately 40 per cent of these exports went to Asia. Very clearly, we have already got our food on the tables of these very near neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Food products such as meat, dairy foods, seafood, horticulture and grains as well as value added and fully processed products will all benefit from the Supermarket to Asia strategy. I am very pleased to say that my own state of South Australia stands to gain a considerable boost from this plan. Total food and beverage exports from South Australia in 1995-96 were $978 million. Our exports in 1995-96 were $282 million and in the same year exports of dairy products were $48 million&mdash;not bad for a state of one million people. Fruit and vegetable exports from South Australia were $101 million, and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processed seafood products were $103 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a striking example of South Australia serving the best to the tables of the world, a point I recall making during my first speech in this place. All of these exports contribute significantly to the South Australian economy and through that economy to all of Australia. In particular, the states' rural and regional areas are involved in primary production and, in some cases, in significant value added industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunities provided in these industries are enormous and very clearly are growing. The government wants to see these areas continue to grow and develop even further. As a result, we have allocated $11.8 million in funding over three years towards implementing this very important strategy. The sum of $1.4 million per annum for three years has been provided to establish and run the Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council and for initial funding and to commission studies in high priority areas. The sum of $2 million per year will be used for three years to fund a technical market access program to be run by AQIS. This funding includes money for placing two AQIS technical access experts in Japan and in Korea to enhance trade opportunities in those countries. This will also help Australia to vigorously promote access to these markets and to remove the impediments and barriers to exports that currently exist with those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the budget has provided an additional $210,000 to develop the Quality Food Australia proposal. This brings total funding for the Quality Food Australia proposal to $600,000. In 1997-98 the government is also providing another $1 million for a program to be known as `The Delicatessen'. This is designed to assist Australian food producers to better appreciate the specific requirements of our Asian customers. It will enable our producers to capture export opportunities for the high value niche market industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supermarket to Asia strategy will bring investment and jobs to rural and regional Australia and through the value added and processing industries to the cities of this country. It provides valuable opportunities and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3927"> support for small and medium enterprises trying to break into these large and growing markets. Overall, the strategy will contribute to an increased variety of high value export products. These are great opportunities that we must seize and make the most of. The Supermarket to Asia program means jobs, more jobs, more exports, and increased profile for Australia's clean and green agricultural industries.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3927"><TITLE>Bass Strait Ferry Service</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about a couple of issues in my own state that are very important from the point of view of Tasmania's economic future. I guess I do not have to repeat here that Tasmania's economy is probably the worst in Australia, our unemployment is at the highest level in the country and we do not really seem to have too much of a future to look forward to, given the actions of the current government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will be aware that the opposition pursued the government over one matter&mdash;that relating to the shipbuilding bounty&mdash;and finally convinced the government of the error of its ways and, as a result, effectively saved a very important industry, one of the largest private employers in Australia. I congratulate the government at the end of the day. They were able to come to grips with the importance of their decision and just how important that bounty was in maintaining at least somewhat of a level playing field for shipbuilders in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue I really want to deal with is the question of the Bass Strait car equalisation subsidy, the fact that our economy is so dependent on tourism and the fact that we have one ship that operates. Senators will remember that, prior to the last election, the Labor government proposed to purchase an additional fast ferry for Tasmania at a cost of around $45 million. That boat would have been built in Tasmania, I would have hoped, and would have now been operating on the service across Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Tasmania purchased a ferry, which was then known as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peter Pan </EMPHASIS>and renamed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS>. At the time
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we had to upgrade the existing ferry, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Abel Tasman</EMPHASIS>. Because it was unable to cope and was ageing, a decision had to be taken to find a replacement for it. That decision was taken. Fast ferry technology at that time was still very much in its infancy and there was no clear indication of whether or not fast ferries had the capability of dealing with long crossings or whether the economies of scale were right for that. Nevertheless, that was proven fairly quickly. As I said, the replacement vessel was bought at great expense to the state. It has operated over that time, running at a loss, I think, with the exception of maybe one year. It is a significant burden on the taxpayers and, of course, on the state government of Tasmania. Decisions that have been taken and that will be taken in the future will be very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one slight glimmer of hope in one area of Tasmania's economy. That is in tourism, because we do need to get more people across the water. The opposition, now government, proposed prior to the last election to provide Tasmania with this car equalisation subsidy. It said, in effect, that it would give Tasmania $49&half; million over three years. I can remember Senator Newman saying, `That's a lot of money that we are going to give the state.' The reality is that the state will get somewhat less than half of that. The real problem is that, even with the subsidy, the ship that we have on the service does not have the capacity to carry enough people to be of any real benefit because it has a maximum capacity. We need at least a second ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that next year there will be an estimated shortfall in supply and demand of a minimum of 10,000 people who would like to go to Tasmania, but the ferry service will not be able to carry them because it will be full. The subsidy has had some impact. It has assisted people going across to Tasmania in terms of the cost of their vehicle. We have to acknowledge that. But the reality is, is it a solution to the real problem? No, it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The builder and manufacturer at Incat, Mr Bob Clifford, has proposed to the state government that a second ferry either be leased by the state government, because they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3928"> simply do not have the funds to purchase it, or get in place some consortium arrangement where we would get a second ferry on the service. What has the poor old state government said? It says, `Oh, no, we can't do that.' The poor old minister for tourism always seems to be lost. Old Ray Groom&mdash;the lights are on but no-one is home. He cannot make a decision. He will not take any initiative. The state is suffering as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest&mdash;indeed, I would urge&mdash;the government at a federal level to talk to the state government and get them involved in the process. It is terribly important to Tasmania's hospitality and retail industries that we get more people into the state. If we can get 10,000 or 20,000 more, it will be of significant importance. It would underpin a lot of employment in the hospitality, service and retail industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The papers and the AHA&mdash;indeed, I have here a number of newspaper clippings&mdash;have all been urging the second ferry to be brought into play. Over and above that, the state government just seems to be lost for direction. It has a problem with regards to the existing ferry in terms of the debt burden that it carries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to look at real solutions. If the federal government is committed to looking at real solutions for Tasmania and if, as it said it was prior the last election, it is committed to assisting the state, you ought to start taking some steps. I would think that at least the Tasmanian Liberal members&mdash;or Liberal member&mdash;and the Liberal senators, two of whom are ministers in this government, ought to be taking up some argument on behalf of the state they are supposed to represent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave notice of a motion asking the Senate to note the Victorian state government's abolition of the Victorian Land Conservation Council, a body set up by the Liberal government in 1970 in Victoria. I set
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3931"> out some details of the work done by the LCC and its valuable role in reviewing the ecologically sound use of public land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say tonight that this council has not by any stretch of the imagination jumped on the environment bandwagon. In fact, its most recent report and recommendations on marine parks in Victoria met with quite some opposition, both from the conservation groups in the state and the Democrats. We argued that the percentage of Victoria's coastline set apart for marine parks was far too small. There has been very little research done on Victoria's temperate waters but there is evidence of depleted fish stocks through what is understood to be overfishing, inappropriate development, and damaging practices such as scallop dredging and the importation of exotic pests in ballast water and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make here is that the LCC cannot be accused of being unduly influenced by pro&hyphen;development or even pro&hyphen;conservation groups. The Victorian state government simply says that the time has come for the LCC. Today it repealed the Land Conservation Act and so abolished the LCC. It intends to put in its place a three&hyphen;person body which will be directly controlled by the minister. This body will only take on inquiries at the direction of the minister. It will be limited in its opportunity to conduct public consultation over land use decisions and there are no clear commitments to a defined public decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator Campbell challenged my notice of motion saying that it was not the business of the Senate to deal with what was a state government issue. I want to say tonight that not only is the Victorian LCC relevant to this place but it has relied and still does rely on the work of the LCC. The federal government's forest task force has used the LCC's land use recommendations in establishing its deferred forest agreements for some time, I gather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no coincidence that the Victorian state government has refused to allow the LCC to release its report on the box ironbark forests and woodlands of northern Victoria before abolishing this organisation. There is nothing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly controversial in that report. As I understand it, it is a descriptive report and it does not even come up with recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that this report will no doubt reveal that there remains in Victoria just 15 per cent of the original box ironbark forests which once covered northern Victoria. Australians have not fought to retain these very special dryland forests in quite the same way as perhaps they have for rainforests and other forests. This study of the LCC covers the vast area of northern Victoria from the Grampians across to Wodonga, including areas around Bendigo, Shepparton, Ballarat, Wangaratta and Stawell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the preservation of these magnificent dryland forests, ironbark makes extremely good firewood and extremely long&hyphen;lasting fenceposts. We have almost no areas of box ironbark which have not at some time been logged for timber or for eucalyptus oils. Ironbark trees take a very long time to grow and they grow in poor and fragile soils, which are highly prone to erosion. The Eaglehawk regional park, near Bendigo, was recommended as a national park in 1981. It still awaits placement on the register of the National Estate&mdash;as I understand it, that is a matter for the federal parliament&mdash;and it awaits the release of the LCC report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this apparent reluctance of the Victorian state government to have this LCC report released has another objective. Not only is ironbark highly prized, but also this part of Victoria, as I outlined here yesterday, is the same area where most of Victoria was mined for gold 100 years ago. The new threat to these forests is the extraction of minute quantities of gold by the open&hyphen;cut method, in which cyanide is used to extract that gold. I spoke at length on this issue last night. I pointed out the damage being done by the huge quarries which are currently proposed all  over this part of Victoria and the effects that this will have on the thousands of residents who live there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also understand the threat to our box ironbark and woodland forests from this very crude and environmentally destructive form of mining. Mining currently threatens 30 hec
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3932"> tares of the Diamond Hill historic reserve and the important and rare wild flowers there. Two new mines are proposed near Heathcote at McIvor Range and in the Argyle state forest west of Heathcote. There is a proposal to extend the mine by 190 hectares at Fosterville, east of Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry will tell us that mining is about jobs and about local prosperity. We all know that these claims have been widely exaggerated in the past. We know that gold mining is a highly speculative industry. Mining companies regularly go into liquidation, leaving behind them a trail of environmental destruction. I heard today that a mining contractor at Costerfield has stopped work because the organisation has not been paid by the mining company. This is just one example of the litany of economic destruction that is left behind so often by mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the 1990-91 census, a total of 300 people were employed in the mining industry in Victoria. I do not believe we can rely on the figures that the mining industry tell us. I do not believe the benefits, where there are any, will flow on to the local community. In fact this story was told to the people of Dunnolly. As I understand it, the mining company which came in there brought its own specialised work force with it and they commuted to the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going on in Victoria should be of concern to the federal government. It should be of concern to the members of parliament in those electorates and it should be of concern to senators from Victoria. The protection of remaining box ironbark forests, the protection of residents' rights to live decent lives without the threat of mining on their doorstep, the protection of the environment so that future generations do not have to live with these enormous scars on the landscape for so little return&mdash;these are the issues and this is why the Senate should be interested in this matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3932"><TITLE>Impulse Airlines</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 November last year in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adjournment debate, I spoke about litigation that was then in train between Impulse Airlines, a regional airline operator in New South Wales, and Jetstream, a subsidiary company of British Aerospace. On that occasion, I referred to this ongoing litigation, which had experienced significant delays and was causing concern to me and others as to the future operations of the regional airline, Impulse Airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have pleasure tonight in being able to put on the record that the parties in that litigation have reached an agreement. Whilst I, firstly, am not aware of what the terms of that agreement are and, secondly, am therefore not able to nor would wish to outline them, I still want to record publicly that the matter has been resolved apparently to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. This is important because it brings to an end, as I said, some lengthy litigation which had attracted some public comment. The judge had expressed concern as to the unnecessary length of the litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, however, also good news because both of these companies are substantial operators in the aerospace airline industry in this country, albeit in different sectors. But both companies are also going to be major employers in the Newcastle region. Late last year, Impulse Airlines opened up a maintenance facility at the Williamtown airport in Newcastle and is expanding its operations in that regard. Equally, British Aerospace was the successful tenderer for the lead-in fighter contract with the air force and also, I understand, is likely to become a substantial employer in the Newcastle region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often times we criticise the operations of multinational companies. Nevertheless, I am pleased tonight to congratulate British Aerospace on their success and on the fact that they have publicly committed themselves to building a major and successful operation  within the Australian defence industry and defence support industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their previous acquisition of AWA and their commitment to expanding their operations as a result of winning this contract demonstrate how a multinational company can

I am pleased to be able to stand here tonight and congratulate both companies and wish them well in their success in the future&mdash;success which I believe is going to be important to the creation of jobs and to the promotion of investment and employment in the Newcastle region, and throughout Australia, in the aviation sector.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3933"><TITLE>Ministerial Reply</TITLE>
