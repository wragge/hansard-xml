<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we last discussed the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996, I was coming to my final comments. I think it is appropriate to put on record the summary effect of the bill. Firstly, it affects a group of workers who in large numbers do not and will not qualify for superannuation, and hence cannot and will not be able to avail themselves of the new world of choice that is inherent in the RSA proposition. Secondly, it affects a group of employees with multiple accounts with successive employers. However, this group already has the option of account amalgamation. Thirdly, there is an alleged problem for those nearing retirement. The easier and simpler solution to allow funds to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offer a capital guarantee investment mix is appealing. If there is sufficient demand, the market will force development of this product. With that summary, I close my comments.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2193" TIME="12.33 p.m." SPEAKER="Allison, Sen Lyn" NAMEID="1M6" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and cognate bills seek to put into legislation the government's election commitment to expand the choice of superannuation vehicles by allowing financial institutions to offer retirement savings accounts. The government's intentions are made quite clear in the explanatory memorandum, which says that RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative structure does not impose the requirement on financial institutions offering RSAs to put in place a trustee structure as superannuation funds have. Rather, the bill sets up a two&hyphen;tiered supervisory regime with prudential supervision of the soundness of institutions continuing through the Reserve Bank and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and state authorities, with functional supervision of the conditions of RSAs being undertaken by the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains details of the approval of RSA providers, the disclosure regime for RSA accounts, the powers of the ISC, the taxation of RSAs and the duties and responsibilities of RSA providers. I state at the outset that the Democrats support the notion of retirement savings accounts but only with significant safeguards in place. We agree with the government that there is a role for low risk, low fee, low balance products which may suit itinerant workers and workers nearing retirement. But we see major restrictions on the benefits of RSAs on any widespread scale. This is because RSAs, by their very nature, are likely to offer very low rates of return when compared with superannuation funds. This point was illustrated by the Australian Consumers Association, which showed that over a 40-year lifetime workers whose superannuation was kept in an RSA would end up with a payout as much as 60 per cent less than a worker in a normal superannuation fund.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past year the industry superannuation funds scored investment returns for their members of around 13 per cent, according to Industry Funds Services. By contrast, the banks are paying interest rates of just 6.4 per cent on long-term, large, fixed deposits and rates of just 2.1 per cent on deposits of up to $10,000 held in investment accounts, according to the Reserve Bank. All parties concede that workers with larger super balances would be better off in a super fund than an RSA. I believe we must ensure that any legislation the Senator passes ensures that workers are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of ensuring the legislation is robust enough to protect workers is made doubly important because RSAs will be offered on a commercial basis. There will be no trustees governing the super accounts required by law to act in the best interests of the member. Rather, institutions holding RSAs will be governed by directors required by law to act in the best interests of shareholders subject only to the conditions in this legislation. Parliament must ensure that the rights of account holders are adequately protected. Sadly, I believe the legislation presented by the government fails to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation does not ensure that employees are adequately informed of the weaknesses of RSAs. Indeed, the legislation does not even ensure that the employee will be the person who chooses to place the funds into an RSA, allowing the employer instead to do so. Survey after survey has shown that Australian workers have a low level of understanding of superannuation and of finance. The likelihood of being able to make informed choices within the narrow information regime and time frames presented by this bill is most unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are particularly concerned that the bill will allow employers to enter into arrangements with financial institutions to transfer large numbers of employees into RSAs, offering much lower investment returns than industry funds, with the onus being on the member to transfer back. These transfers could occur in a background of financial institutions offering substantial benefits to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employers for delivering to their workers, such as access to finance, commission and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Consumers Association, in evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, expressed the concern that the Trade Practices Act, particularly section 47, is inadequate to defeat such practices. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to ensure that entering RSAs is about the employee's assessment of the benefit, not the employer's benefit. The Democrats will also be moving amendments to ensure that employees are fully informed about the investment performance of RSA products and superannuation funds before they sign up for RSAs. We will be moving amendments to prevent employers from signing up RSAs on behalf of the employee, except in the limited case where an employee was provided with the information and failed to support a superannuation fund within 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued that the employer nomination rights mirror the rights of employers under the SIS legislation, in that an employer can nominate a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee. The argument is that this act sets up a level playing field, but it is not level. I am prepared to accept employees being forced to join a particular superannuation fund because the law requires the trustees of superannuation funds to act in the interests of the members. RSA providers have no such legal duty. These are low return products and there should be no compulsion driven by the employer of the RSA provider for anyone to join.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be pointed out that the coalition's election promise to introduce RSAs was very much about providing additional freedom of choice. The policy made that quite clear. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition's intention is not to replace existing superannuation funds, but to complement current arrangements by expanding the range of options open to consumers . . . RSAs provide Australians with greater freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But this bill will fall well short of this idea. If a worker freely chooses to place their superannuation funds outside the trustee structure into a low return RSA product, that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2195"> is their choice. But the choice must be free; the choice must be between an RSA and some other product. The government says that these issues will be dealt with in its freedom of choice legislation. We have not yet seen that legislation and we may never see the legislation. Yet the issue of choice and RSAs are inexorably linked in the government's own policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I will be moving amendments to make it a condition that RSA providers cannot open an RSA account unless the employee has been offered a choice between joining the RSA or the relevant industry fund or, if there is no industry fund, between the RSA and some other superannuation fund. I will also be moving amendments to ensure employees are warned that when the RSA reaches a large level at, say, $5,000 and again at $10,000, they would be better off, in terms of long&hyphen;term investment returns, transferring their funds to a managed superannuation fund. This does not mean that they cannot keep their RSA open if they wish. But when the account reaches $10,000, the continuing of the large balance of the RSA should require a positive election by the member. If they do not elect, the amount should be switched into a managed fund approved by the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also be moving to ban fees being charged on RSAs. The credit unions, in evidence to the committee, said that RSAs could be offered on a no fee basis. Given that deposits will be regular and infrequent, maybe quarterly, and given that withdrawals will only be to close the account or on retirement, the cost of running these accounts will be minimal. RSAs will provide financial institutions with access to fairly low cost finance. The current five&hyphen;year term deposit rate is a maximum of 6.4 per cent, the business lending rate is 9.75 per cent and the home loan rate is temporarily around 7.55 per cent, so there is substantial profit margin there for the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failing making RSAs fee free, we will be seeking to strengthen the powers of the ISC to require RSA providers to abide by standards of low fees. The amendments I am proposing to move will bring the RSA legislative package close to the recommendations of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the majority&mdash;the coalition and Democrat members of the superannuation committee in its 15th report in 1995 on the small amounts problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the  register of interests I declared that my sister&hyphen;in&hyphen;law was a director of a major superannuation fund. I draw the attention of the Senate to that fact again. Whilst it does not impact on this particular debate, some people may infer that it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first entered this chamber and made my first speech, I referred to three aspects of dignity&mdash;in youth, work and retirement. The Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and cognate bills touch on the last issue&mdash;dignity in retirement. I believe that dignity in retirement is of fundamental importance to people in this day and age. The aged pension has not necessarily afforded people that dignity over a long period, whereas superannuation has given people access to at least an element of dignity which otherwise would not have been provided by the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years the average worker was condemned simply to the aged pension. In previous times many people felt no real security in retirement, and superannuation itself was the province of executives. This ensured those executives a reasonably comfortable retirement, well above the level of pensions, and there was a major breakthrough when award superannuation and the SGC came into existence. This changed the nature and the perspective of superannuation as far as the average worker was concerned. I must agree with what Senator Allison said: the average worker does not have a great deal of understanding of what superannuation is really about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must approach the legislation that is before this Senate this afternoon with caution. One must be very wary that the product that is being made available is a product that will in the long term benefit and add dignity to those people in their retirement. When award superannuation and the SGC came in, they did go part of the way to ensuring the dignity in retirement of the average worker. But it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2196"> must be remembered that their aim was to give a real and tangible long&hyphen;term benefit to the average worker. Of course, one must hold some reservations about whether RSAs&mdash;I am sure that this is a real concern that would be shared by many of my colleagues&mdash;will deliver a real and long-term tangible benefit to the average worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at what happened with award superannuation, it can be seen that on that occasion it was an attempt by the employers to hijack the funds that were created and so use them for their own purpose. But, alas, they found this not to be the purpose for the establishment of those superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am getting at is that the purpose of the establishment of the superannuation funds was purely and simply to deliver a long-term benefit to the worker. It was not for any other ancillary or subsidiary purpose; it was purely and simply to deliver something by way of a tangible benefit to the workers themselves. I think my colleagues Senator Bishop and Senator Sherry in their speeches on this particular matter alluded to this also. In the award superannuation situation we found that the insurance companies tried to coopt employers to direct their employees into a particular insurance company sponsored scheme. This was a `you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back' type of operation for which the measure was never designed or meant to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the fence though, we had union-employer jointly sponsored industry funds. These became the target of every form of castigation possible by the employers and the insurance industry alike. The aim of the industry funds was to be representative of their members and to do the best that it was reasonably possible to do for their members. So that major difference between the those with the industry funds and those who had some sort of insurance or superannuation company sponsorship was fundamental in the early days of award superannuation and drove quite a wedge between them out there in the real industrial world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that stood industry funds aside from the insurance company sponsored schemes was the matter of administrative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charges. Many of the insurance company sponsored schemes had a relatively high administrative charge structure. This, in the longer term, diminished the return that was to be given to the worker whose money was being placed in these schemes&mdash;and, of course, that money was to be of vital importance to these people when they finally reached retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Invariably though, industry funds were able to charge and did charge less than insurance company schemes because their primary focus was the people they were representing and, of course, the affinity that many of the people on the boards of those industry superannuation funds had with the people they represented. Industry funds did work for the best interests of the workers; whereas one would clearly question whether, in the longer term, RSAs will serve this purpose. I think the reservations of people already expressed in this chamber clearly indicate there are doubts that RSAs will be the product they should be for many people in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the industry superannuation schemes there was supposed to be a choice for employees as to what fund their contributions would go into under the award system. However, this never really happened in many instances. That is one of my primary concerns when we look at RSAs&mdash;that people will not have a genuine option to choose which fund their funds will be placed into; and that is regardless of the advisability of the product itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to page 54 of the report on retirement savings account legislation, the 22nd report of the Senate select committee, my colleagues who were on this committee put forward a number of recommendations. Just briefly I will address some of those recommendations because I think they go to the nub of the concerns that many people who are average workers out there in the community&mdash;the battlers&mdash;would have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn firstly to the recommendation of my colleagues that the employer should show the consent of the employee to the opening up of an RSA account. I think that is very important. It should not be something whereby the employee is dragooned into a particular RSA. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2197"> I think it is of fundamental importance to the person that they have a choice&mdash;and that it is transparent&mdash;to go into that product or, as Senator Allison, into an industry fund even which will undoubtedly afford a higher return than the RSA would be able to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing in the recommendations of my colleagues is that any commercial relationship between the employer and the RSA provider should be clearly disclosed. Again, this is for transparency so that there are no behind the scenes deals being done and that everything is aboveboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the recommendations of my colleagues is on the matter of disclosure&mdash;that, before the RSA is opened, there needs to be up-front disclosure on matters such as fees and charges, the interest rate, the commercial relationship between the employer and the RSA provider, the fact that it is low growth and the fact that it is low return. This seems an eminently sensible approach to take when people are going into these low return and low growth investments&mdash;a product which is described as a health warning in my colleagues' report which was tabled in the major report of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the disclosure up front supports what Senator Allison said before me: that there is this ignorance of superannuation, this general lack of understanding of what superannuation is. Those who are in contact with superannuation on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis generally and invariably have no problem in dealing with this type of product, but to many people it is a mystery. Of course, if the employer has employees in a situation where they are dragooned into a particular fund, then they have no idea of what is happening&mdash;it is a matter of, `Sign on the dotted line.' Employees find themselves in a totally disadvantaged position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other recommendations that my colleagues came up with was that there should be a prohibition on the issue of third line forcing. One might ask the question: how is this done? I do not necessarily have all the answers, nor do I necessarily know how one will find the proof. I am leaving that to Senator Conroy, who signed that section of the report. There is no doubt, though, that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comes again to the transparency of the relationship. If a deal done between the employer and the RSA provider has an advantage for the employer because of some commercial advantage to the RSA provider in signing all the people into a particular RSA fund, then that is quite clearly a breach of trust on the part of the employer, and should be prohibited under all circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not referring to all the points raised by my colleagues, but there are two others which I think are important at this stage. The first is `that the definition of the capital guarantee be amended to reflect the sentiment that accounts cannot be diminished by fees and charges'. There is nothing worse than seeing a person's savings diminished by fees and charges. The second&mdash;last, but not least&mdash;is education. If we are going to have a low growth and a low return package, then education of those people out there who will be subject to this package is terribly important indeed. You just cannot say, `Buyer beware,' because in many instances people are not aware of what the products are, as I said earlier. Of course, some of them are migrant workers. Some itinerant workers have poor English&hyphen;speaking backgrounds, therefore an education process to overcome the difficulties that these people may face is terribly important indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always supported the concept of super for ordinary workers; I believe it is fundamental. I do not know whether this product before us by way of retirement savings accounts will deliver what superannuation should deliver. I trust that the government will look favourably upon the opposition's amendments to this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has a superannuation system that has received much praise around the world. It is not a perfect system, but one which has been built on a recognition by all parties that it is in the national interest, as well as in the individual's interest, to introduce the SGC and the regulatory system which accompanies it. This legislation is the beginning of the end of a bipartisan policy on superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's objectives are twofold: firstly, at a macro&hyphen;economic level, to improve our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2198"> national savings to help address our chronic balance of payments problem and, secondly, at a micro&hyphen;economic level, to provide security for all Australians when they retire. The ALP responded to changing circumstances throughout its time in government by refining and improving the system, but always with those two goals in mind. What we are seeing today is the assertion of narrow sectional interests and a political pay&hyphen;off. The government has made claims about this bill. I quote from the Treasurer's press release of 20 August 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts and those nearing retirement (wishing to minimise risk). Their introduction will complement existing arrangements by increasing competition and choice in the superannuation industry, thereby putting downward pressure on fees and charges, and encouraging better standards of service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When introducing the bill in the other place, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Chris Miles, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Retirement Savings Accounts&mdash;or RSAs for short&mdash;have a central role to play in the Government's strategy for increasing choice and competition in the superannuation sector. Choice gives employees greater scope to control the management of their superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that an examination of the detail of the bill shows that the bill fails even the government's stated objectives Further, if you test this bill against the previously stated objectives of the ALP, which presumably had coalition support, it becomes clear that the bill must be amended before passing the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us examine each of the government's claimed objectives. Firstly, `simple, low cost, low risk'. It is true that the RSA product will be low risk. However, the flip side to low risk is low return. I will return to this shortly. Secondly, `low cost'. The Treasurer makes the assertion that RSAs will be low cost but, when he gets the opportunity to guarantee this by legislating on this critical issue, we have a blank sheet and a promise. Where is the clause that protects against a reduction in the capital amount through fees and charges? There is not one. When pressed on this issue, the Australian Bankers Association agreed it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was possible for fees and charges to erode the capital amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no protection for balances under $1,000, as was introduced under the ALP's legislation. This was introduced as a specific measure to guard against the erosion of an account. The average industry fund charges between $25 and $35 a year to administrate a member's account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I welcomed the suggestion of a number of organisations, which presented submissions to the committee, that their members would not charge any fees for an RSA, the banks have made no such promise. In fact, if you take the evidence given before many inquiries into banks and their fee structures, the banks make it clear that their obligation is not to the customer but to the shareholder. They have increased their fees and charges on all their small depositors in an effort to increase their profit margins. This has caused significant hardship for many thousands of ordinary Australians. Now the banks would have you believe that they want to offer a service to the worker with small accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to this issue is that the current superannuation funds work within a trustee structure, which means that profits generated are returned to members' accounts, not to a third party. That is the shareholders in the case of banks. There is a financial incentive to minimise costs to members. This is not just empty rhetoric. This has been proven as the competition from industry funds has slashed costs in the superannuation and life assurance industry&mdash;from the many thousands of dollars previously to below $100 a year in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that this bill will allow an employee to consolidate several superannuation accounts into one RSA account&mdash;the implication being that this is desirable. Yet submissions to the committee acknowledge that it is, in fact, likely that a casual or itinerant worker can be forced into the identical situation of multiple RSA accounts. The legislation ignores this. The single greatest furphy being put forward by the government to support this legislation is that RSAs will increase choice and give 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2199"> employees greater control of their money. That is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's commitment to allow super funds to offer RSAs in its March 1996 election campaign statement, and the initial cabinet submission from Treasury which was leaked, the legislation has dropped this promise. Why? That question has to be asked. If we want choice, why exclude super funds from offering RSAs? The smell of a political pay-off grows, but even this does not give the game away. It is not until you examine clause 51 that this government is exposed for rank hypocrisy. This clause is where the employer is allowed to open an account on behalf of an employee without the consent of the employee. That is right, senators&mdash;without the consent of the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was much discussion of this by the committee, and some attempts were made by officers of the ISC to suggest that this is current practice. We in the opposition are neither convinced that it is standard behaviour in the industry nor, more importantly, that the opportunity for abuse that now exists is a comparable situation to what has been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that, irrespective of an employee already belonging to a fund and not seeking to change the arrangement, the following can occur: an employer can take the initiative in opening up an RSA on behalf of an employee; RSAs can be opened for employees without prior consent; contributions can cease to an existing fund, unless protected by an award provision; contributions can be forwarded to the RSA prior to the employee receiving any information from the RSA provider; contributions can be forwarded to the RSA prior to the employee consenting to have the RSA as his or her superannuation vehicle, consenting to that particular RSA provider. The ACTU summed up this issue before the committee as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . choice of funds should not rest with the employer&mdash;such a practice denies employees ownership of their superannuation benefits and is contrary to the government's stated objective of promoting greater consumer choice . . . Employers have no direct interest in ensuring employees' superannuation contributions are paid into low cost and efficient superannuation saving vehicles which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meet both the retirement needs and employment patterns of their work force. Employers have no direct interest in ensuring that superannuation contributions are placed in a superannuation vehicle which has an investment program which meets the risk profile and aspirations of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is there that the bill fails the last of the government's objectives. This legislation creates a product with a brand name, excludes competitors from using the brand name and then mandates a reduction in individual choice by removing the owner of the money from the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost all super funds in Australia are moving towards a system called member choice; that is, each member can choose the investment pattern within the fund that they would prefer. This allows true choice to control the management of superannuation savings. Will RSAs be required to allow options on investment patterns? Of course not. Clearly, this bill fails on all of the government's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to be the outcome of this legislation? There are three grounds on which I believe this bill, unamended, should be rejected. These are that they reduce national savings; they reduce the individual's retirement income; and, critically, they will lead to corruption of the relationship between banks and employers. This is referred to as third line forcing. This practice is illegal under section 47 part IV of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to occur is that banks will approach their existing corporate clients and offer to establish and administer RSAs for their employees. Why is this different from a fund offering to do this? A fund will not offer to reduce the interest rates on the employer's overdraft rate in return. That is right: banks will offer a financial incentive to the employer to hand over his employees' money to the banks. From where I stand, this is nothing more than a bribe. Yet this is not specifically made illegal in the bill and potentially falls outside the Trade Practices Act. Where is the clause that stops this, Senator Kemp? Where?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the abuse is out in the open. This is even admitted by the banks. When put to the ABA&mdash;before the committee&mdash;that this would occur, this was their response:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2200">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot see that it is a conflict of interest. I really wouldn't want to speculate on the nature of the incentives, or the qualification of those incentives, but the notion of incentives is part of any business relationship. It is part and parcel of normal business. As long as it is not improper, as long as people are comfortable with those arrangements, then so be it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the banks. Improper, they say! This is a commercial arrangement between the bank and the employer over an employee's money. The banks do not even believe they should have to reveal the nature of any inducement to the employees who will be losing their money into these accounts. So banks believe that this will be a normal business practice. And what about the government&mdash;who are not even here? Where are the safeguards? Where the penalties for breaching them? Again, silence. An absence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the consequences of this bill on national savings? The government's own actuaries have calculated that there will be a significant reduction in the pool of national savings. This report was released last year with almost no fanfare. Some industry assessments have suggested that this reduction could be in the order of $21 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the consequences for an individual who is placed in an inappropriate RSA? The Australian Consumers Association have profiled a number of examples which give a clear indication of how much an individual can lose if they are trapped in an RSA. To quote them, `The cost of a low long&hyphen;term return is enormous.' They calculate that the loss can be as high as $200,000 in a final payout. That is twice the pension rate that exists today if it is taken in the form of a pension. This will mean that individuals who previously have had little or no need of a pension from the government will now be forced to rely on the government in their retirement. And remember that an employee may be forced into an RSA because a bank has offered a bribe to an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How, then, can this bill be improved to protect the interests of the worker and his or her money? It is obvious that education is critical. This legislation should mandate the information to be provided. The most critical is the health warning, which should be given 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the outset. The initial information should include all fees, charges and commissions; a clear explanation of risk; historical and possible future returns; the importance of the cooling off period; and any financial gain to the employer if the employee purchases the RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation should have an automatic opt&hyphen;out clause, not a default that leaves an individual in an RSA. An individual should make the choice to remain long term in an RSA, not be automatically defaulted into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need, as Senator Hogg earlier indicated, for a substantial education campaign by the ISC and government to complement this legislation. Yet there is no commitment in the legislation to provide that education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I repeat: this legislation fails all tests&mdash;government's and opposition's. It reduces national savings; it reduces an individual's retirement income; it is not guaranteed low cost; it will not reduce the number of accounts; and it does not increase choice. This is nothing more than a pay&hyphen;off to the banks who bankrolled the coalition in the last election campaign.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the only education campaign that needs to be conducted is here in the Senate&mdash;and particularly for the government members&mdash;because the fact that they brought this legislation into this parliament at all is an indication that there is a massive education campaign required. We should not even be debating it, let alone voting for or against it. It is the most ridiculous piece of legislation that you could ever want to see, in terms of providing anything that it claims or even pretends that it might provide at the end of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the government says it is about freedom of choice. We have heard from a number of speakers that there is no freedom of choice. Indeed, even in today's superannuation world, there are enough problems with regard to the provision of freedom of choice. Some employers&mdash;and, thankfully, this is not a standard practice&mdash;who may have their insurance with a particular company will seek to force their employees to take out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2201"> superannuation benefits with that company. And they do so on the basis of possibly getting their insurance costs reduced. The fact that you are going to move to an RSA with banks and credit unions and the like will only exacerbate that problem. If we had a deal with superannuation, we ought to be  about trying to fix up the problems, not creating them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major problem with this is that superannuation or retirement savings accounts ought to be about&mdash;if you had them&mdash;providing funds for people in their retirement. The very purpose of superannuation is that. And I think to a large degree, superannuation funds&mdash;and we introduced compulsory superannuation and the levy&mdash;have been significantly successful. There has been a huge increase in the number of people who are covered by superannuation. So if we look at RSAs from that point of view and what is proposed with them, they are not going to pay anywhere near the level of interest or attract anywhere near the level of interest rate that will bring them even within the ballpark of interest rates that are paid on superannuation funds&mdash;nowhere near it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And while we are talking about freedom of choice, the other major factor ought to be the consumer benefit. Yes, consumers may want freedom of choice, but I know that in terms of superannuation benefit and retirement benefit, they want a return. They want a proper benefit. The legislation provides for no ability for there to be any guarantee on return. I was curious about the Democrats' position of supporting the government in the introduction of RSAs. I think I heard Senator Allison say that they could expect a return of around two per cent. What a load of nonsense&mdash;complete and utter rubbish. These funds will, at best, attract a quarter of a per cent. I think I also heard Senator Allison say that the Democrats would move to amend some guarantees in terms of fees and charges. Another load of rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People ought to understand that the Australian banking system is one of the most pathetic in the world. Over 50 per cent of the money that ordinary Australians currently have in banks earns less than two per cent in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest. You are talking about $120 billion. Banks have around $15 billion of Australians' money that the banks pay no interest on whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to be about supporting a piece of legislation that endeavours to give those banks more Australians' money that is supposed to be for their retirement where the bank will pay them no interest and, on top of that, turn around and charge them fees on it. The Senate ought to understand that we have an obligation to the people of Australia, particularly those that are looking to governments to provide legislation in respect of their retirement, to ensure that there will be some benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back to this matter of freedom of choice. There are already products in the market that can deal with problems of portability and pay a minimum rate of interest of around four per cent. I am totally amazed that the Democrats have chosen to support the government in this way in terms of this legislation. The other issue of freedom of choice, which was raised before, is about workers' rights. There is no way that workers will be guaranteed any rights in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, they will end up with a heap of RSAs: one with Westpac, one with Commonwealth, one with ANZ, one with NAB&mdash;a great lot they are!&mdash;and maybe with credit unions. Whomever the employer banks with will be where the money goes&mdash;and all attracting fees and charges because the government cannot and will not legislate to remove all the banking facilities' rights to charge fees on these accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worthwhile noting what the Australian Consumers Association had to say about bank fees and charges. I think in 1996 bank fees and charges went up by 200 per cent. I do not know whether or not the government plans to amend this legislation to provide for a maximum level of fee, but even if it took that small step it would never protect these small amounts of money in these types of RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of problems with the existing superannuation process. The government would do better if it addressed itself to some of those problems. What some superannuation schemes have done in the past&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2202"> some may well continue to do&mdash;is set up a particular program of investment which will attract a set of fees. They do not necessarily tell you over what period those fees will have to be paid and, if you choose to take the money out of one particular fund and place it in another, that there are opt&hyphen;out penalties. The government says that as far as RSAs are concerned there will not be an opt&hyphen;out penalty. It is just simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really has to come down to this: if you are on about providing choice and benefit, then you will withdraw this legislation and have a really hard look at what is required for the provision of superannuation benefits and retirement schemes to Australian workers. This proposed legislation will do nothing and provide nothing, except provide the banks with the ability to further rip off the Australian community in terms of the money that in many cases will be forcibly taken from workers and put in their particular bank or banking  institution, and the workers will have no say. The banks will then lend this money at interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think someone pointed out earlier what banks charge us when we borrow. They and their shareholders will be reaping huge benefits. It is very interesting to look at the National Australia Bank: a $2 billion&hyphen;plus profit and a return to shareholders of around 17&half; per cent. But look at what they pay the poor old punters whose money they exist on. Without the punters' money, banks would not exist. It is about time we took a long hard look at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the government: withdraw this legislation and really do something that is positive for the Australian workers and Australian consumers. Take the right steps by making legislation that provides for better outcomes for retirement savings and take a long, hard look at legislation that makes our banking industry more competitive and treats Australian banking consumers more equitably.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate because what we have seen from this government is a persistent attack on what is really a world&hyphen;class retirement incomes framework that was established by the previous government. That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is not simply my view; that is the view of overseas experts about the system which has been established here and which provides a basis for the provision of retirement incomes into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will do little to develop that framework further. In many respects, this measure will weaken it and will weaken the trust that people are developing in the superannuation framework. We have heard about other measures, particularly in relation to the 15 per cent additional tax on superannuation, known colloquially as a surcharge, that this government is seeking to place on the high income earners. We are told that a number of people will withdraw some of their funds from the superannuation system. That is not doing anything to strengthen the system. Whether or not it is supported in this chamber, the fact is that there are so many changes being proposed to superannuation and this is not doing anything for anyone's security in the superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the previous government was attending to appropriate regulation many concerns were raised as to the extent of legislation which governed the superannuation industry and the investment mechanisms that underpin it. There was a lot of criticism. The Labor government was told that there needed to be a greater degree of simplicity in the system and that the legislation is difficult to understand. But what do we have? This is one of a number of pieces of legislation. I understand that when the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives it had 154 pages with a consequential amendment bill of 83 pages and a regime which would require between 200 and 300 regulations to underpin it. So much for simplicity for probably a small part of the system. Nothing to engender confidence in the superannuation system would arise from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the underpinning tenet of this bill&mdash;that is, the issue of choice and the protection of the balances of lower income earners, whose money, it is alleged, would be better placed in these retirement savings accounts&mdash;the reality is that, firstly, this bill does not guarantee that the fees and charges which will be levied against these accounts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2203"> will be reduced compared with the fees and levies which would otherwise be brought against accounts in trustee based superannuation fund accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage nothing ensures that the balances could easily be withdrawn from these accounts without the attraction of significant fees&mdash;fees, in fact, significantly higher than those which might be levied by trustee based funds&mdash;so that employees would have real choice and portability in relation to their funds, particularly as their balances reached a level where the rate of return became critical as to the rate of growth over the life of those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard in relation to another bill in this chamber, the workplace relations bill, that this government was concerned about choice and freedom of choice. We were told about the ability for individuals to reach agreements, Australian workplace agreements, and there would be freedom of choice. Subsequently, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) announced in support of the Workplace Agreements Commissioner who was appointed, Mr Rowe, that the requirement to enter into an agreement prior to employment was not duress but freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has provisions which require banks to make disclosures about all information relevant to the performance of retirement savings accounts, but whom do they have to disclose that to? Not the employee, whose money will be in the account, but the employer, who will make deposits on behalf of the employee in circumstances which would otherwise mean the holder of the moneys would be a trustee organisation. But this legislation will obviate the banks from having that trustee structure&mdash;a structure that is required in other superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This type of account is being equated with an ordinary bank account, yet the employees will, I believe from my reading of the legislation, have no say. Their money will be placed into an account which will be entirely within the control of the bank. That is quite remarkable. There is no point in this bill requiring the retirement savings account provider to disclose information directly to the employee prior to the account being opened. Indeed, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> account may be opened without the express permission of the employee. The employer can open that account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt it is possible, as has already been said in this debate, that the employer will decide that it is advantageous to have all accounts held in a retirement savings account provided by the banking provider that conducts the other banking of that business. If we are looking at freedom of choice, there can be no confidence about real choice being made in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that this situation is no different from the current one where employees are, by virtue of awards, required to have their superannuation accounts held in one or another of particular industry fund accounts. But that occurs not because the employer or an employer organisation determines that. It is at the direction of either the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or one of the state commissions. So an independent body able to look at the matter makes an order, but in these circumstances an employer could say to employees, `I want all of you to have your superannuation in retirement savings accounts with the bank I bank with,' or another bank or provider that that employer chooses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe nothing in this bill allows, for example, groups of employees with a particular employer to opt for different providers&mdash;that is, there may be 10 employees and each choose 10 different retirement savings account providers. That would be freedom of choice. I do not think many businesses would welcome it, and possibly that is why the government does not make that option available to employers. Nevertheless, that is real choice. If this government is about real choice, it would provide that option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is suggested that this was one of the government's election promises and that it is only fulfilling its election promises in pursuing this legislation. That is an honourable notion, but if it were consistent in pursuing its election promises I would have a great deal more respect for it. We have seen so many of this government's election promises declared `non&hyphen;core', which is an interesting code term for `breakable' because so many of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2204"> government's election promises have been broken. But in this case we have an election promise, which will deliver to the banks billions of dollars of low cost money, which this government is apparently not prepared to countenance breaking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw senators' attention to the register of senators' interests, which will indicate that my partner is a director of an industry super fund. In addressing this bill, I think four questions need to be answered. Will RSAs provide a sound investment? Will having the option of having RSAs improve consumer choice? Will they improve access to superannuation by low income earners. Whom does the establishment of RSAs benefit? Unless those questions can be answered comprehensively&mdash;and certainly in the case of the first three very clearly to the advantage of the consumer&mdash;I do not believe there is justification for this legislation to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the first question: will they provide a sound investment? You need to look no further than the fact that this legislation has not provided for restrictions on fees and charges to see that there is no secure investment here for people opting for an RSA. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The second point I wish to make is in respect of the trustee structure. Here you have a piece of legislation advocating the establishment of superannuation type accounts, but the people who are managing those accounts do not have the members' interests at heart. This is where the real contrast can be drawn between the existing contributory superannuation schemes and RSAs where it is the shareholders of the banks and the profit margins of those banks which become the primary interest. Indeed, the banks have to take the shareholders' interests to heart in making their commercial decisions so there is an inherent contradiction here in these accounts supposedly providing for the best interests of members as their first point of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the industry superannuation schemes provide very secure mechanisms to ensure their members' interests are at heart; that is, through their trustee system of management. That trustee system, by having both industry employee and industry employer representatives, ensures that those interests and any profits that are made are returned directly to the members' accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have already heard my colleagues talk about the reduction in national savings which will arise from this legislation. That has been established. We have also heard that because of the low rate of return on RSAs&mdash;they are low risk investments but they also have low rates of return&mdash;individuals who have their retirement savings placed in one of these accounts will be definitely financially disadvantaged. I do not believe that you can answer `yes' to the question, `Will RSAs provide a sound investment?'. The answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question I posed was: will having the option of RSAs improve consumer choice? The question of choice is  the basis of this government's whole campaign about retirement savings accounts. Once again, we are hearing the glib exercise: `Why is it necessary to implement these? Oh, it is because of choice.' We need to look no further back than the debate in respect of the Workplace Relations Bill to see how this government is becoming quite adept at dressing up a removal of worker rights and entitle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2205"> ments by stating that the question of choice has been a foremost and primary concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the introduction of RSAs, we are not talking about choice. We are talking about this government legislating to provide an inferior option for people seeking  superannuation accounts or funds. For a start, the accounts, can be opened by employers. What happened to the quite sound principle of providing a system in which consumers themselves are empowered to make decisions about their own financial future and financial security? Surely, you need look no further than the way in which some of the industry funds manage themselves and provide information to members about exactly what the rates of return are and exactly what the particular investment will furnish those people with on retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the super guarantee currently in place, there is a requirement for employers to provide for their employees. This bill specifically undermines the intent of that super guarantee. It does that by providing an inferior product and by providing it in a way in which the employers, at this point of time under this current legislation, do not have any say in how it is put in place. The employer can open an account on behalf of the employee and, at the moment as this legislation stands, they can do it without even providing full identification. Surely, this flies in the face of principles that have been previously established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the issue of choice, let us go back and look at the Workplace Relations Bill debate. To my recollection, an amendment was moved that ensured that superannuation was part of the essential elements of an award, of the allowable matters. This government wanted to exclude superannuation from awards. It was through negotiation, in the greatest instance with the Democrats, and certainly insistence by Labor that superannuation was indeed included as an allowable matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us speculate for a moment about where we would be now with RSAs if the government had been successful in removing the requirement that superannuation be an allowable matter. Not only would the superannuation requirement in the awards not be there, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but this government then would also have a far more open ended regime to pursue retirement savings type accounts without any requirement on employers to provide contributions to a certain fund. So the answer to my second question about whether the option of RSAs would improve consumer choice is no. RSAs specifically deny the choice of particularly lower income earners as to where their superannuation guarantee contributions are placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My third question is: will it improve access to superannuation by low income earners? Once again, we cannot answer this question in the affirmative. There is a considerable number of moves by this government that undermine superannuation, but none is more blatantly obvious than that of providing a retirement savings type account designed quite specifically to draw funds away from industry superannuation and put them straight into the banks through the establishment of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These funds are specifically targeted at lower income earners and people who get a lower rate of return with respect to their superannuation. Perhaps their superannuation guarantee is lower by virtue of the fact that they earn less money. Perhaps it is lower because they have transient employment. Perhaps it is lower because they are part-time workers. You do not need to make too many more points than that to realise that it will be women who suffer disproportionately, once again, under this legislation. The issue of gender equity in superannuation is something that had been at the forefront of the development of superannuation policy under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry superannuation funds quite clearly have established their product to ensure that the lower income earners, the part-time wage earners and the high proportion of women who make up those groups are directly serviced under the existing superannuation arrangements. RSAs, on the other hand, will provide a mechanism for employers to divert funds for those people into an inferior fund, into an RSA that we know is low risk and has a lower rate of return. We know that employers will have the choice to put the money there if they so choose and we know there is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2206"> no assurance that the bank will not apply fees and charges to the accounts in the way there are assurances for other superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question is: who does the establishment of RSAs benefit? Well, I cannot see too many beneficiaries at all except for one. That, of course, is the banks. Most Senate colleagues have articulated quite clearly some of the motivations behind the government enacting this legislation, which quite specifically benefits only the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing my comments with respect to these bills, I can only say that the ad hoc approach by this government to superannuation policy shows that they have no clear direction and that there is no public interest at heart here. So what is motivating this government? The timing of this bill shows, once again, a lack of strategic approach to national policy. With the Wallis recommendations forthcoming, it is very clear that enacting this type of legislation at this point in time would pre-empt a large number of the issues that are going to be dealt with or attempted to be covered in this RSA legislation. The four questions I have asked cannot be satisfactorily answered. Therefore, I do not believe there is any justification in proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One final point I would like to make about the superannuation industry funds, apart from their rates of return and their provision of services to industry, is that, because of the way they are run with the members' interests at heart, an array of benefits are now provided to members of industry superannuation schemes. They include cheap home loans, information and general education about retirement investment. They provide other insurances as well, such as death and disability coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if there is only a relatively small amount of money put into those accounts and the government's justification for drawing the lower income earners away from the industry funds, I do not see the banks providing those sorts of services at all to those lower income earners. When we do a comparison of industry superannuation funds and RSAs, we need to look further than just the sheer financial advantage of having your money invested in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an industry superannuation fund. You need to look at the other services they provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction is that the industry superannuation funds as they are currently constructed provide those additional benefits to the members themselves. If the banks proceed with these RSAs, the incentives and advantages the bank can offer as a package do not go to the members but to the employers, who can choose whether or not to open the RSAs. There is a direct question here of equity and of who is benefiting from this whole process. When they are compared in that light, there is no way you can possibly draw the conclusion that RSAs will be of any benefit to anyone contemplating saving for their retirement. I believe that, having put it in that perspective, the government is best advised for a whole range of reasons to not proceed with this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

That principle has been forgotten in recent years but it is in fact fundamentally important, and no less true now than it was then.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Without properly protected means of retirement saving or life insurance, the working man or woman has no means of providing against the vicissitudes of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be discussing the principles of the superannuation tax in later legislation that is coming before us. I do not want to bore the Senate with my views&mdash;not on this bill, anyhow&mdash;which have been long held in those particular respects. I just want here to focus on the proper legal framework for prudential aspects of superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point to remember is in fact whose money we are talking about. It is the workers' money. It is not the employers' money, it is not the banks' money, it is not the superannuation funds' money, it is not the life 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2207"> offices' money&mdash;it is the workers' money. What we are talking about here is workers' money set aside for extremely important purposes&mdash;the protection of the worker and his or her family in the event of death, disability or old age. We are talking about money which is the money, in many cases, of widows and orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot said in the press and elsewhere about the high fees charged by superannuation funds. One of the arguments for retirement savings accounts is that banks can compete cheaply in the provision of savings repositories for these superannuation moneys. I accept that workers should not be impeded from choosing the best place for investing their retirement savings. If competition leads to reduced fees and charges on workers' superannuation savings, that is all to the good. I therefore have no theoretical objection to banks and other properly supervised financial institutions from being allowed to offer retirement savings accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I might note that it would be wrong to accept what appears to be the start of a propaganda campaign that all superannuation schemes are necessarily inefficient or costly. I can speak personally of one particular scheme, REST&mdash;the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust. That is an industry scheme that is run for retail employees. It is quite efficiently run and charges are moderate. Further, because of union representation on the board of trustees, workers are better able to ensure that their funds are being properly administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I accept that there will be cases where workers, for example, workers with frequent changes in jobs between different industries, may wish to have a retirement savings account with a bank into which they direct their employers to pay superannuation contributions on their behalf. However, if there is to be competition in the area of retirement savings, it should be founded on the basis of a level playing field in terms of accountability to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be an acceptance of the fundamental principle that these are essentially trust funds. These funds are being compulsorily set aside by workers to protect themselves and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their families. They are being held for the benefit of all workers, from the most sophisticated and well educated to the least educated. These workers are reposing their trust and confidence in the institutions into which they place their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been accepted that the law of trusts provides proper protection where one person holds money for the benefit of another. Since the 19th century, superannuation funds have almost invariably been administered under trust deeds. The protection of superannuation beneficiaries was grounded on the full power of the courts of equity to enforce fiduciary duties of trustees to trace misappropriated funds and to compel production of accounts and disclosure to beneficiaries. The principle of trustee obligations was implemented in the life insurance act 1945, which provided in section 38(8) that every director of a life insurance company should be under the same liability in respect of policyholders' statutory funds as if he had been a trustee under a trust under which policyholders were beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, we are talking about financial institutions soliciting funds of the public without prospectuses and that those funds represent moneys dedicated for the protection of workers and their families. This is being done without any prospectuses. Parliament has seen fit, in the past, to require that persons holding such funds accept the duties of trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to remember also that we are talking about RSAs into which funds can be directed by employers. This is one matter on which I agree with the opposition. They have raised this in the committee. One of their recommendations, which I will be supporting, is that it will be a requirement on the employers to show that there has been agreement and direction by the employee, the beneficiary, that their funds go to a particular RSA, if that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be an enormous amount of pressure and an enormous number of incentives offered to the employer to make sure that all of the employees' superannuation contributions go into a particular bank which is running the RSA. Those incentives, for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2208"> example, could mean a reduction in the overdraft rate of interest, et cetera. That could benefit not the beneficiary of the superannuation payment but the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider the law of fiduciary obligations and of trustee responsibilities entirely appropriate in this context. Every person putting aside retirement savings in a financial institution should have the protection of the law of trusts. The institutions are large, powerful and well advised. They hold themselves out as experts in the management of money. Those entrusting them with their retirement savings are generally, at best, unequal in bargaining power and may often be naive or commercially unsophisticated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, I am strongly of the view that the law of contract, the law of debtor and creditor, should not be the sole basis upon which retirement savings accounts are based. We are told that we have got the Trade Practices Act. That is not sufficient in these particular regards. I think it ought to be recognised all round that the law of contracts, the law of debtor and creditor, should not be the sole basis upon which retirement savings accounts are based. We would not be acting responsibly in creating these vehicles for workers' savings unless we make it clear that the financial institutions accepting these funds must also accept the obligations of trustees in relation to the beneficiaries of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The noted legal historian Professor F.W. Maitland once described the law of trusts as England's greatest gift to the field of jurisprudence&mdash;interesting. The whole law of trusts is built on the concept of loyalty and fidelity to the interests of beneficiaries. Where we are dealing, as we are here in this bill, with moneys being set aside for the protection of widows and orphans, moneys being taken without prospectuses and moneys not being borrowed in a commercial context, then the law of trusts in my view should be our starting point in terms of consumer protection.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell that one, Senator Collins; you cannot. All the other arguments we heard from the other side of the chamber were rather spurious indeed. They ignored one simple fact&mdash;that there is an inherent risk in money which is invested in the superannuation funds as they are currently structured in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to relate that the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Senator Kemp, and I were about five or six years ago early advocates of an alternative to the industry superannuation fund route, which the previous government was then putting into place. Senator Kemp in his wisdom recognised that the great danger with the superannuation funds was that a preponderance of the money was invested on the stock market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators would know that it is easy to be wise in the middle of a bull run, but it is a little bit more difficult to be wise in a bear run. The reason why retirement savings accounts need to be introduced as soon as possible is that we are about to go into a bear run. For people who are within five years of retirement, leaving their money in a currently structured industry superannuation fund could have disastrous consequences for the real value of their superannuation when they come to retirement. I think there are some wiser heads on the opposition benches that recognise this fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were in an industry superannuation fund and were to ring up today and ask what my payout is, I would only get an indicative payout. There is no guarantee that the money that would be available to me today would be available to me tomorrow if the stock market collapsed this afternoon. That is why it is absolutely critical that we have retirement savings accounts as an additional means of providing certainty to workers in terms of their retirement funds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2209">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we just go down this blind route&mdash;and blind it is&mdash;of saying, `Industry superannuation is the cure for all our woes. Industry superannuation will make every Australian richer when they come to retire,' that is absolutely and utterly wrong. There are many workers in this country who have been made poorer by the existence of the current industry superannuation system. There are many workers who do not earn large sums of money and who, in fact, pay more in fees than they receive from contributions to the fund. So at the end of every month they end up poorer. That is what this legislation is aimed at correcting. This legislation is aimed at correcting that problem which was a direct consequence of the legislation introduced by those on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are attempting to ensure not only that we provide choice and not only that people on low incomes do not have their retirement savings eaten up by fees and charges from the industry funds but also that we provide a mechanism to ensure that those who are about to retire can lock away the value of their current superannuation and be saved from the risk of having that fund eaten up by a collapse of the stock market in three months or three years.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2210"> There is no sector more deserving than the small business sector&mdash;the engine room of growth and the sector that can provide jobs and opportunities and meet the aspirations of so many Australians who are disappointed by Labor. Yes, Madam President, the government has responded to one of its election promises today. The election promise was the Bell report into small business and the response had been put down by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good news for small business and, as I said, they deserve it. Just remember very briefly the background against which we came into government. Small business had done it enormously hard under Labor. Thirteen years of Labor government had left the country with the second highest prime  interest rates in the western world. In 13 years of Labor we had watched our living standards fall from the 10th place in the world to 22nd. In 13 years of Labor government we witnessed the taxation system becoming more and more complex and compliance costs rising. Thirteen years of red tape for small business contributed to investment declines and ultimately contributed to that deficit blow&hyphen;out and the pressure upon interest rates and all the other detrimental consequences that flowed from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broken promises, wrecked hopes and dreams and a Labor government that was out of touch with the mainstream of Australia left a big challenge for the incoming Howard government. In relation to small business since then it has been good news. As you know, Madam President, the Howard government was determined to get the fundamentals right. As a result of getting the fundamentals right, having the courage to tackle that huge deficit&mdash;the $10 billion Beazley black hole&mdash;we have been able to see three reductions in official interest rates in the course of only 12 months. That has brought particularly home interest rates down, but it is also brought small business rates down. Increasing competition in the sector is heartening as well. We now see new competitors being introduced into the small business interest finance sector such as Aussie Home Loans and that is good news for business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, apart from getting the fundamentals right, as you are also aware, through the last budget we gave some specific benefits to small business. The provisional tax uplift factor was reduced from eight per cent to six per cent&mdash;good news for small business. It delivered $180 million back into the sector. You will remember the capital gains tax rollover relief to benefit small business. You add to that the industrial relations changes that were introduced last year to enable a more flexible labour relationship and in particular the destruction of Labor's unfair dismissal laws, and small business was being given a fair chance at last by a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are we now for small business? I remind you that the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, spoke last Thursday about Australia entering into a new golden era of sustained economic growth similar to that of the 1950s and 1960s. This flows from sound economic management and it is good news and gives small business a chance. But we are not happy with that alone. We are determined to build on that and the announcements of the Prime Minister today will do just that. What has he said? He said that there will be fringe benefits tax record keeping exemption for small FBT players&mdash;good news. Those will provide a similar level of benefit from year to year and they will be benefited&mdash;less red tape, easier for them to do business. He said that we will introduce a fringe benefits tax exemption for car parking provided by small businesses on their premises and widen the exemption for taxi travel to cover travel to and from the place of work at any time of the day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Ferguson for his question. The coalition has fulfilled an election commitment in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business </EMPHASIS> publication. As Senator Hill has pointed out in his answer, small business is the engine of employment growth in the Australian economy. Small business under the previous Labor government was decimated. It was decimated by interest rates of over 20 per cent. It was decimated by a rigid centralised industrial relations system. Labor had no sympathy whatsoever for small business because it was largely non-unionised. It did not feature in the accord. Small business was decimated by the unfair dismissals, which were a deterrent to employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party never understood that small business in the main started off with small equity and relatively large debt. This meant that if a business was sold to buy a new business or on retirement, it was slugged with crippling capital gains tax. There was no recognition whatsoever under the Labor Party that to small business operators their business was the major part of their retirement plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has acted strongly and positively to address the concerns of small business in relation to capital gains tax. The measures announced by the government today ensure that capital gains tax rules do not unnecessarily restrict the flexibility and entrepreneurship of Australian small business. Already the government has introduced capital gains rollover relief and exempted the proceeds on the sale of business from capital gains tax. The measures announced by the Prime Minister build on those initiatives and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2212"> respond to issues raised by the small business community about the use of different business structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will extend rollover relief in respect of the sale of business assets for reinvestment to include the sale of shares in a company operating a small business. It will extend the capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small business by an individual on retirement to include situations where the small business has operated through a private company or a trust. The government will eliminate the need for keeping capital gains records for more than five years by introducing an assets register for capital gains tax.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The BBC has a very different model. The BBC World Service is actually funded by the foreign service, the foreign office, in the UK. I very much hope that, when Senator Forshaw puts down his report in the fullness of time&mdash;and, unfortunately, far too late for budget deliberations&mdash;he will at least turn his attention to that approach because that is an interesting model. I am not saying it is necessarily relevant to Australia, but the fact is that it at least demonstrates that, as far as the British are concerned, they see it as a useful adjunct to foreign policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was not the view expressed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in giving evidence to Mansfield. Indeed, they reflected that they could not be sure about the efficiency and the appropriateness of Radio Australia, and they had some serious question marks which no doubt led them to express a reluctance to undertake funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact remains that there are a large number of other ways in which people get access to information in the region. Something like 100 transponder sites are, or shortly will be, available. All of these provide opportunities for people to find out what is going on in the real world&mdash;certainly through news and current affairs services. That is what is important, I think&mdash;not that some people in Europe who are expats might like to tune into the AFL, but that people who want to know what is going on in terms of news are able to ensure that they can get access to those services. They can get them from places other than Radio Australia, and I think it is important that that continues to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But from the government's point of view, as you would well know, Senator Forshaw, the policy position we announced subsequent to the election for future funding of the ABC involved a commitment to a reduction of $55 million in the next financial year. Mansfield endorsed that as perfectly do&hyphen;able, but he did it on the basis that they had to find that $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to say that somehow that should not be met by something like $20 million from Radio Australia, then the onus is on you to indicate where it should come

If your preference is to see ABC programming around Australia cut back very significantly so you can preserve a fully fledged international service, then stand up and say so.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This ongoing line of questioning basically runs along the line that the government has no industry policy&mdash;basically you have said that. There has been a suggestion that tariff reform has become a de facto industry policy. The rationale for these questions appears to be that, because the government rationalised some industry programs to reduce the budget deficit, there is no policy. I would be interested, Senator Murray, if you would give me the source of your information in your response because last week when you raised this question you talked about the loss of 200,000 jobs. Let me point out to you that there was a growth in employment of 20,000 jobs in manufacturing over the previous year. This takes into account a small drop of about 2,000 jobs in February. So, not the 200,000 that you keep talking about; in fact, there has been an increase of 20,000 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for these questions is a nonsense and belies the fact that the Commonwealth's industries policy is coordinated and comprehensive and includes the following elements: macro&hyphen;economic stability, efficient product in labour markets, promoting investment, encouraging innovation, improved market access, improving education, reducing the regulatory burden for small business, and working with industry sectors to counteract market failures and facilitate structural adjustment. The suggestion that the government has no industry policy or that tariff reduction is a de facto policy is quite ludicrous. It is more ludicrous because of the fact that we are essentially a free trading country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has made policy changes which reflect differences in the belief systems of the government and the opposition. The previous government talked about getting the business environment right, but did little or nothing about it because it was hostage to vested interest. As part of our approach, we are taking on issues that are vital to business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2215"> which Labor ignored for years. These are not small measures, and they will create jobs which are sustainable. I would like to repeat what I have said in the past: we are repairing the budget deficit&mdash;notwithstanding, I might say, the pressure put on by the opposition and the Democrats not to repair the budget. We have reformed the labour market, we are tackling the waterfront and we are cutting red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal source of job creation is a thriving private sector. I think I said that last week, Senator. We are committed to providing programs that provide the support that business needs. To this end, we have established the Mortimer review to examine the grab bag of programs left behind by Labor. We will also apply sectoral policies where they are appropriate. For example&mdash;and I mentioned it last week; I have forgotten whether it was in answer to your question or not&mdash;we are committed to the future viability of the automotive manufacturing industry. Some have been running around, I might say, like Chicken Little, proclaiming the sky is falling in because the Productivity Commission is reducing tariffs on cars. Apparently the Chicken Littles have only just realised that the Bogor declaration includes cars. The question of when to reduce tariffs to meet our APEC targets is an important one which the government will be addressing after the Productivity Commission completes its report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can be quite clear that the issues that the government will be tackling will go beyond whether we have free trade in the year 2010 or a few years earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for his question. Senator, what the government is doing in rearranging the employment services market is corporatising the CES, turning that into the Public Employment Placement Enterprise, and expanding the range of competition with PEPE, as it is called, and community and private sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial level of competition between the old CES and the community and private providers was in fact started by the previous Labor government. It was one of the initiatives of Working Nation, for which we have given them significant credit. It is one of the initiatives we intend to expand so that there will be competition between the old CES and private and community providers not only for case management, or intensive employment assistance, but also for job placement services. In the past there was no competition in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you have asked me whether any people will not be able to get assistance. The touch screens, which provide the general information now available in the CES, will be available to anybody, as they are now. But for benefits for which the Commonwealth pays, which are job placement services&mdash;we will be paying for those&mdash;and for intensive employment assistance for those benefits, there is a more restricted access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of this government that it is the role of those services to assist people who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2222"> are unemployed and on a benefit to get off that benefit and to get a degree of independence, because that is what getting a job does for you. It gives you independence from being dependent on the Commonwealth. So that is one of the criteria&mdash;not the only one&mdash;for those people who can benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the wife of a wealthy job seeker or the spouse of a very successful female, who is acting as a househusband, get intensive employment assistance? No. Could they do that now? Probably not, because, as you know, case management under the previous government is not an unlimited access program. It is a capped program of expenditure. When you cap a program of expenditure, it is obvious that what you want to do is direct your services to those most in need in the first instance. That is what this government is about&mdash;giving the services first up to those most in need. Those most in need are the ones who are now on a benefit and they will have first access to the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular exception to that which I would like to raise is access to intensive employment assistance for young Australians who might be judged at risk of becoming long&hyphen;term unemployed. In their circumstances, it will not matter whether they are on a benefit or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other variations, but the bottom line to your question is that where the Commonwealth is paying money for a benefit to be provided&mdash;that is, job placement or intensive employment assistance&mdash;the first access to that must be to those who are now on a benefit.</PARA></ANSWER>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2224"> in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1997 AUTUMN SITTINGS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to remove all references to "spirituous beverages" and replace them with references to "distilled alcohol". This will ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol regardless of their alcohol content.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under item 2 of the Schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) all potable spirits are subject to excise duty, including beverages containing spirits. Such beverages have been treated as excisable regardless of their alcohol content. Approximately $17 million in excise duty is expected to be collected in respect of spirituous beverages in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) commenced the manufacture of the product known as "Subzero Alcoholic Soda". At that time, the beverage was made from spirit obtained from the de-alcoholisation of beer and has approximately 5.5% alcohol content. The Australian Customs Service (the ACS) considered "Subzero" excisable under item 2 of the Schedule to the Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). In June 1996, the AAT determined that the production of "Subzero", with such a low alcohol content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and is therefore not excisable under item 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this decision, the ACS is continuing to impose excise duty under item 2 on all other similar low alcohol beverages. Approximately $ 12.6 million in excise duty has been paid under protest on such beverages since June 1996. The ACS is also appealing the AAT's decision to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if the Federal Court upholds the decision of the AAT in the CUB case, it may mean that all beverages which contain distilled alcohol and are of low alcohol content (other than those made with caramel or water) are not spirituous beverages and are not excisable under the Tariff Act. This appeal will be heard on 5 May 1997. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with this bill in one sittings to eliminate the possibility of refunds of several million dollars in excise duty having to be made to manufacturers of low alcohol beverages.</PARA>

I have now postponed this matter on at least two occasions&mdash;maybe three&mdash;prior to this time. I think it is grossly unfair to continue to deny the people some outcome with regard to this issue. I wanted to indicate that to Senator Campbell and I would like to hear some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words from him. The last time we discussed this matter, it appeared that a report from the ASC was within a day or two of being with the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I postponed it at that time, the indication was that if I postponed it until this day, that would be more than ample time for the government to come forward with a position, whether they tabled the report or whatever the case may be. All I can say is that, come 26 May, if there is no report and/or if there is an unsatisfactory outcome, I will be endeavouring to proceed with the motion. I think that, to deliver justice to these people, that is what has to be done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have pleasure in tabling the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's response is the fulfilment of yet another election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government thanks the members of the Task Force, which was chaired by Charlie Bell, the Managing Director of McDonald's, for their work in developing a comprehensive blueprint of practical reforms to significantly reduce the burden of regulation and red tape on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bell Report was entitled `Time for Business'. The government's response is entitled `More Time for Business'&mdash;it is all about giving small business men and women more time to be productive in their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government endorses the great bulk of the Task Force's 62 recommendations. We have also decided on additional measures to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business is an integral part of the decentralised network of family, workplaces and community which is the most effective guarantor of freedom and choice in our society. Small business is also a job creation machine. In the decade to 199495, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to surveys undertaken for the Bell Task Force, half of all small business operators surveyed said that a significant reduction in compliance costs would allow more time to run the business and more than a quarter saw it as increasing profitability, with benefits for economic growth and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aim is to get governments at all levels off the back of small business. Small business should not be bogged down in paperwork and forced to deal with a multiplicity of overlapping regulatory bodies. Small business cannot afford excessive overheads and on&hyphen;costs: the overriding priority is to maximise time for business, which will generate economic growth and jobs for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised small business a new deal at the last election and we are delivering on that commitment. Our macroeconomic policies are contributing to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2232"> higher national savings and delivering low inflation, which have taken pressure off interest rates and delivered lower debt servicing costs to small business. We understand, however, that many small businesses are still doing it tough in the new, very competitive, low inflation environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We announced in the last budget capital gains tax rollover relief which will encourage the expansion of small business. Another budgetary measure, the capital gains tax exemption on retirement, will provide a nest egg for small business owners who have been too busy ploughing all their capital back into the business to worry about superannuation. The provisional tax uplift factor has been reduced from eight per cent to six per cent at a cost to revenue of $180 million, improving the cash flow of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have swept away Labor's jobs&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal laws. Compulsory unionism has been abolished and a new, more flexible industrial relations framework established to encourage greater cooperation in workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Statistics is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small business by 20 per cent. New regulations affecting business are subject to a sunset clause and we are reviewing existing business rules and regulations to abolish outdated ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our response to the Bell Report builds on these achievements. The overall package involves reforms to business taxation and regulatory programmes at a cost of over $600 million over 4 years. Our willingness to fund this package in the current budgetary circumstances is a reflection of the government's strong support for the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now wish to outline some of the main measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">TAXATION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dealing with our complex tax system was the number one compliance issue identified by small business in submissions to the Bell Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few areas of taxation are more complicated than fringe benefits tax, FBT. There are around 55,000 small businesses that currently pay FBT, many of which pay relatively small amounts but incur substantial paperwork and compliance costs. We have therefore decided to abolish the FBT record keeping requirement for businesses which provide less than $5,000 in taxable benefits in a base year and which maintain a similar level of benefits from year to year. FBT paid in subsequent years will be based on the base year liability. This will benefit up to half of small FBT payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers would be required to establish a new base year if they elect to have the amount of FBT 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> varied down in later years or the benefits provided increase by more than 20 per cent above the base year, or by more than $100 if this is greater. However, once they have established a new base year, they will again not be required to keep records as long as the taxable value of benefits does not materially alter thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FBT treatment of car parking will also be reformed. From 1 April 1997, car parking provided by small businesses on their premises will be exempt from FBT. Certain provisions denying deductibility for self&hyphen;employed car parking will also be removed from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All businesses will benefit from the extension of the FBT exemption for taxi travel to cover travel to and from the place of work at any time of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also liberalise capital gains tax rollover relief. It will now apply to the sale of shares in a small business. This will assist those small business owners who prefer to realise their interest by selling shares rather than the underlying assets of the business. This further liberalisation will increase the cost to revenue of the measure by about $90 million to around $300 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small business for retirement will now be extended to taxpayers who operate their small business through a private company or trust. This will increase the cost to revenue of this measure by about $35 million to an estimated $50 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new capital gains tax provisions will apply from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of asset registers for capital gains tax purposes will be allowed, eliminating the need for taxpayers to keep source documents after five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Businesses will be better able to manage their cash flow through changes which will enable them to make voluntary tax payments at any time from 1 July 1997. The amount of time in which small companies and small instalment taxpayers can lodge their returns and pay liabilities will also be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has not accepted the Task Force's recommendation for changes to the wholesale sales tax system, which would have involved increasing taxes for a range of goods and taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">UNFAIR DISMISSALS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bell Report recommended a review of the new unfair dismissal laws after 12 months. We support that recommendation but have decided to go further in recognition of the particular difficulty small business has in dealing with complex industrial relations requirements and our concern to stimulate employment, particularly youth employment. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2233">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Businesses with 15 or fewer employees will be exempt from the Federal unfair dismissal provisions for new employees until they have been continuously employed, whether full time or part time or on a regular casual basis, for 12 months. This will give small business every encouragement to hire new staff confidently, particularly younger, less experienced employees. Safeguards will remain. Small businesses will still be required to provide the statutory minimum period of notice on termination and to satisfy the provisions of the law preventing dismissal of employees on discriminatory grounds, such as pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be writing to State Premiers to encourage them to adopt similar provisions in their jurisdictions to provide the maximum boost possible to small business employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be required to improve the system for parties in terms of when and where industrial matters, including unfair dismissals, are dealt with. This will be particularly relevant to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE INITIATIVES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business cannot afford the time or expense of dealing with multiple regulatory authorities, including duplication by different tiers of government. The former Industry Commission found, for example, that a proprietor of a small hotel in one jurisdiction had to be familiar with 12 separate statutes and six codes of practice just to be sure of complying with state and Commonwealth occupational health and safety laws. Business regulation should be as efficient and streamlined as businesses demand of their own operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will establish a single registration process for the Australian Taxation Office, Securities Commission, Bureau of Statistics and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission by July 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will work with state and territory governments to develop a single point of entry for all levels of government through which business can obtain information on all government requirements and programmes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next four years we will create a comprehensive national business information service, including a business regulation free&hyphen;call service, streamline business licensing and approvals processes and merge similar licenses into single, `common' licences. These initiatives, which will cost around $23 million over the next four years, will result in considerable savings in compliance costs for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preparation of regulation impact statements for all Commonwealth legislation or regulation that has the potential to affect business will be mandatory. The costs and benefits of regulation will be weighed up carefully to ensure that the putative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits are not outweighed by excessive economic and financial costs, including the compliance burden on business. The Assistant Treasurer will be given the authority to enforce these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tangible demonstration of the government's determination to avoid unnecessary increases in the regulatory burden on industry was our recent decision not to implement privacy legislation for the private sector at the Commonwealth level. I also raised the matter at last week's Premiers' Conference. I have asked the Premiers and Chief Ministers not to introduce such legislation at the state level. Queensland and the Northern Territory have already agreed to our request and the other states will consider the Commonwealth's request further. I will be writing to the states to set out our concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cooperation with state and Territory Governments, the Commonwealth Government will be accelerating processes to reform regulations in the areas of food, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, building codes, occupational health and safety, workers' compensation and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Industry Commission has estimated, for example, that savings of $350 million a year could be made from more efficient building regulations and a further $750 million from improved planning. Our reforms will reduce overlap and duplication, encourage greater national consistency and simplify processes. We will not be pursuing uniformity for its own sake. The aim is to achieve lower compliance costs for all businesses, large and small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ACCESS TO FINANCE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that small business must have adequate access to finance if it is to grow and prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from its reforms to capital gains tax and provisional tax, the government has made it easier for banks to invest equity capital in business by changing prudential guidelines on equity investments and making the tax treatment of equity investments in small and medium&hyphen;sized enterprises more attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have now decided to go further to encourage our small technology&hyphen;based firms. The high risks and long time horizons in the high technology sector justify targeted assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are setting up a Small Business Innovation Fund, under which up to six early&hyphen;stage capital funds will be established to invest in more than 100 small technology firms over five years. The Commonwealth will provide $130 million from the R&amp;D Start programme and private sector fund managers will be responsible for finding matching private contributions on the basis of $1 of private capital for every $2 contributed by government. This will provide up to $200 million for investment in this growing sector over the next few years. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2234"> support will provide more jobs and exports in this important and growing area of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUSION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, during the election campaign, we committed ourselves to the goal of reducing the burden of paperwork and red tape on small business by 50 per cent in our first term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that our response to the Bell Report, along with other initiatives that we have already taken, will make a substantial contribution to that objective by the end of our first term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As evidence of the government's good faith, we are establishing objective performance indicators which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new package will require the ongoing commitment of governments at all levels and regular feedback from, and constructive dialogue with, small business if it is to work. I appreciate the willingness already indicated by Premiers and Chief Ministers to cooperate on matters involving Commonwealth&hyphen;State regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise that we can never meet all of the expectations of one sector of the community. We have kept faith with small business and gone further in some areas than we promised. We also know the ongoing challenges which small business faces and that our small business policies must be subject to a process of continuous improvement. That is why I pledge that my government will keep listening to small business and acting on what we hear.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Before I commence my remarks, Madam President, I would indicate, on a point of order to you, that I think there is an understanding across the chamber that this debate take place for one hour, with obviously limitations to speakers as per the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first document tabled today, in my view, outlines a systematic abuse of parliamentary entitlements by Senator Colston. The first Senate report identifies some 16 occasions on which Senator Colston claimed travel allowance for overnight stays in Canberra when the travel records show that he was not in Canberra. Those 16 occasions relate to 23 overnight stays, the payments involved totalling $3,230. Madam President, the second report that you have tabled today identifies a further eight similar discrepancies in Senator Colston's allowance claims. They involve some 12 overnight stays, and the overpayments there are some $3,065. The total in the two reports comes to $6,295 being falsely claimed and paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the documentation that we now have before us also reveals a report by the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;a report, as I understand it according to this documentation, that Senator Colston has had in his possession since 5 March. That identifies a further seven discrepancies relating to Senator Colston's travel claims, and these involve eight overnight stays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reports that you have tabled today contain irrefutable documentary evidence that, while Senator Colston was claiming travel allowance for being in one place, he was actually in another place. There is nothing in the information  that you have tabled, and there is certainly nothing in Senator Colston's limp defence, that in any way convinces the opposition that what we are dealing with here today is anything other than deliberate and systematic abuse of Senator Colston's parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentary entitlements. To make one or two mistakes would be understandable, to make half a dozen mistakes could perhaps be put down to carelessness, but to make 31 mistakes for 43 overnight stays is neither understandable nor attributable to carelessness. In my view, and in the view of the opposition, it does represent deliberate and systematic abuse. I go to my comments in this chamber last week. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is entitled to know whether the irregularities and discrepancies are merely mistakes by the Department of the Senate or poor staff work by all of Senator Colston's employees or whether they constitute systematic fraud against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I said then that the only possible reasons for these overpayments could be mistakes by the Department of the Senate or, as I have said, poor staff work by Senator Colston's employees or systematic fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of the report that we have before us now, it is absolutely clear that this extraordinary number of breaches is in no way due to mistakes by either the Department of the Senate or the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;and, I might say, not even Senator Colston suggests that that is the case. It begs the question: could this be due to poor staff work? It is no surprise that that is where Senator Colston lays the blame. He expects us to believe that the fault lies with a staff member&mdash;a Mrs Christine Smith. Quite frankly, that just does not wash. This is the same Mrs Smith whom the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) moved heaven and earth to promote. I suspect that if Mr Howard is the only person in Australia willing to swallow this sort of pretence, he will just as quickly&mdash;again without any due regard for proper process&mdash;move to demote the same Mrs Smith. I think that everyone in this chamber knows what we are dealing with here and who is at fault. It is the person who signed for each and every one of these claims. It is the person who banked each and every one of these payments. It is the person who  wrongfully claimed taxpayers' money over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, We should all bear in mind that the reports that you have tabled, damning though they are, are very narrow in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2237"> scope. They simply match two sets of documentation that are available to the Department of the Senate to check Senator Colston's whereabouts against his claims. They are limited in the period they cover and they are limited in the number of claims that they cover. Frankly, they raise as many questions as they resolve. I think we can now understand why the government protected Senator Colston and opposed the opposition's move to reconvene the estimates committee to pursue these issues. We can see why the government just opposed the motion that I moved to have the DAS report tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary situation, I believe, that Senator Colston himself, with a clear interest in this, came into this chamber to defeat a motion to have these reports tabled, reports which he has had in his possession&mdash;according to the documents that you have tabled, Madam President&mdash;since 5 March. There are number of loose ends that have got to be tied. For example, the Department of the Senate points out in relation to each of the incidents it identifies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Potential additional supporting evidence may be available from airline passenger lists on relevant flights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This evidence must be obtained. We also note the comment of Mr Holt, an officer of the Department of the Senate, in the second report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the above,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the two reports that we referred to earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there are a number of potential irregularities on which the department is awaiting further advice from DAS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate is entitled to be informed of the outcome of those investigations and those irregularities. Details ought be tabled in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said it before but let me say it again: it is time to end this farce. It is time for the government&mdash;particularly the government&mdash;to stop pussyfooting around. Madam President, it is time that you put this matter in the hands of the competent authorities. I ask you, on behalf of the opposition, to hand these reports that you have tabled in the Senate today to the Australian Federal Police without delay

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2240"> monetary repayment. I, too, note that Ms Smith is the same staff member who has been the recipient of the salary package upgrade. One might have thought that efficiency would be a component in a promotion. I think it is very odd that for 3&half; years a person can be administratively inefficient and still be capable of being on the receiving end of such an important promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is very narrow in that it deals only with the allegation that Senator Colston claimed travel allowances for stays in Canberra when, according to Comcar and airline records, he was elsewhere. The report identifies 31 occasions relating to 43 overnight stays during a 3&half;&hyphen;year period when Senator Colston falsely claimed a travel allowance for nights in Canberra. The total cost, according to the Department of the Senate, was $7,580. At the end of this report, there is a photocopy of a cheque from Senator Colston for $6,880. Whatever else Senator Hill might want to say about sloppy bookkeeping, it seems to me that 43 overpayments in 3&half; years cannot be legitimately explained away by inadequate bookkeeping or administrative error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Colston was reconciling the dates from the list given to him by Ms Smith and transcribing that on to the form that he signed himself, it is inconceivable that he did not look at a calendar and notice that so many of these were weekend dates and ask himself the question: was I really in Canberra for all these weekends? That is a question that would occur to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report does not examine the distinct possibility that further illegitimate claims or further bookkeeping errors may have been made in respect of travel outside of Canberra. I suggest that a perusal of the records suggests that this is quite plausible. This report also does not look into numerous other allegations against Senator Colston, in particular those specifically raised at estimates committee by Senator Ray: the use of Comcar services; the misuse of travel allowance by his son, Douglas; and allegations of misuse of parliamentary entitlements including postage. We know why. We know that there is a big question mark over who is responsible for the administration of these matters. Nevertheless, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think people out there listening to us would wonder why we are only having this little focus on nights spent in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this report is deficient in that it fails to comment on the undeniable pattern of either unnecessary or unwarranted travel as a member of various committees. Surely this is the responsibility of the Department of the Senate. Just from reconciling the information on this matter that we do have on the public record, a very clear pattern emerges. For example, take the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. Four external territories visits have been made since 1993, for a total of 33 days, by Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other senator to claim an external territories visit was former senator John Coates&mdash;and that was for six days, two of which were for committee hearings. There was an external territories visit for six days in November 1993 tacked on to the end of a committee hearing. There was an external territories visit for 11 days in January 1994&mdash;11 days on Cocos and Christmas islands, three in Perth and then off to Norfolk Island for another four days for the committee hearing. There was an external territories visit on 24 September 1994 for eight days, but ironically Senator Colston missed the committee hearing in Canberra on 23 September 1994. There was another one for eight days in January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of a pattern being established: in the two months prior to Senator Colston being replaced as Deputy President, for 40 days and 40 nights&mdash;which has some religious significance at this time of the year&mdash;Senator Colston travelled on either office holder or regulation and ordinances chair business: two days in Hobart, six in Launceston, 12 in Canberra, six in Melbourne and nine in Sydney. I wonder whether that had anything to do with the fact that his travel allowance at that time was worth $300 a night and it was about to fall, after his loss of that position, to $190 a night! I do think you can look at these matters; they are relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of the regulation and ordinances committee: in 1993-94 Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2241"> Colston spent 11 days on regulation and ordinances work. Only one other committee member joined him for two of those days. In 1994 Senator Colston found a great deal more interest in regulation and ordinances work; he went from 11 days to 25 days. In 1995-96 that grew to 36 days. Only one other member of that committee&mdash;again, Senator O'Chee&mdash;claimed, and he claimed for two days but in a different city and at a different time from Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In four years Senator Colston has claimed 75 days as the chair of the regulation and ordinances committee, compared with five days of claims for all other committee members. That is compared with 40 days of claims for Senator John Watson, who has been running 17 full inquiry references in the important superannuation select committee. Why have these matters not been commented on? I am happy to receive an answer on that from you, Madam President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is the Department of Administrative Services' report. On 25 February&mdash;that is one month ago&mdash;when Senator Colston's alleged misuse of Comcar was revealed on Channel 9, the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, told the ABC PM program and Channel 9 that DAS would be commencing a full investigation. On 20 March the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Kemp, confirmed in an answer to a question from Senator Ray that, yes, DAS was preparing a report on the misuse of Comcars and parliamentary entitlements and that Senator Colston would be given the opportunity to respond to that report when it was ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the government, Senator Harradine and Senator Colston himself voted against a motion to require that this particular DAS report be tabled by 5 p.m. tomorrow. Why does the government refuse to table this material? Why isn't the Australian public entitled to all the relevant information being brought together, not dribbled out bit by bit to try to draw your conclusions here and there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say that this matter should run its course. Why is the DAS report not ready after one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> month? Why should it not be available to all of us in conjunction with this other important report which is being tabled today? I ask Madam President and Senator Kemp to give an answer to this question to the Senate, because I do not think that taking a cheque for a second time from Senator Colston is the appropriate or accountable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government is serious about accountability and trust in the system, then taking a cheque for the second time is not acceptable nor appropriate. Mr Howard, in my view, has to reply to this parliament about what he intends to do with the cheque given to the Collector of Public Moneys by Senator Colston. Madam President, I would like you to answer this next question at some stage: when can the Senate expect to see the DAS report?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Hill comes in here and says, `This was due to poor bookkeeping,' you could probably believe that that was the case for 74 senators in this place. But, as Senator Colston's ex-staffers will all attest, the first duty Senator Colston attended to for a period of up to two hours when he returned to his electorate office was to fill out his financial journal, in which he filled out every possible claim for travel allowance, every possible tax deduction and every transaction he had committed up until the last time he was in his electorate office. He would not receive phone calls, he would not see constituents and he would talk to no-one until he had completed that task. So I do not think Senator Hill will get a refresher fee today for producing poor bookkeeping as the excuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill also said, `Why single Senator Colston out?' Well, excuse me; I thought Senator Colston requested this inquiry&mdash;albeit it was only after he found out that you, Madam President, were holding one that he enjoined in the case. So he should not complain about being singled out when he in fact requested such an inquiry. But then, in classic Senator Colston methods, he says in his report, `I want everyone else audited.' Haven't we all heard that before when it comes to the publication of figures!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2242">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let him make an accusation. But I am sure every one of the other 75 senators here will, if an accusation is made, take the first available opportunity to defend themselves in this chamber. All of us may have made mistakes in the past; who knows? And I think the leader was right to say, `You could expect two or three mistakes over five or six years.' But not to this extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not repeat the figures, but I will go to one set of figures alone. According to the second report, Senator Colston has falsely claimed four nights in Melbourne and four nights in Sydney within a couple of months of each other. That is eight nights and $2,400. Do not tell me that when that was put before Senator Colston&mdash;and he physically, as he says in this document, transcribed it on a form&mdash;he could not remember spending four successive nights in Melbourne and four successive nights in Sydney. Not even the most busy minister would come up with that excuse. I hate staying a night in Sydney. How could you forget four nights there, and how could my home city, the glorious city of Melbourne, be forgettable when you have spent four nights in a row there? It is just not believable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something about the methodology of this inquiry. If there is an implicit criticism of the Senate department, I do not intend it, but this was a very limited inquiry. This inquiry did not go back past 1 July 1993, and it should go back to at least 1990, because the Collector of Public Moneys will get a great dividend if it goes back that far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second limitation of the inquiry is that only six months of interstate travel has been checked thoroughly by the department. So there is another minefield there of about seven years to be gone through to see what other mistakes have been made. The third methodological error, the classic error&mdash;I do not think the Senate department would have contemplated this till this report came out&mdash;is that they have checked only the nights Senator Colston was in Canberra and when there was countervailing evidence he was elsewhere. Given these 43 nights, it may be time to check for evidence of whether Senator Colston was in Canberra on the several 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hundred other occasions when there is not that countervailing evidence. At least airline bookings and Comcar records should now be checked to see whether he ever came here or just hid up in Queensland and put in his claims. That is a big task, I admit, but that is logically where the next set of inquiry should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that, from a methodological point of view, these inquiries failed to go back past July 1993, failed to look at all the interstate claims other than for a six-month period and failed, if you like, to try to verify all those other claims in Canberra when Senator Colston may have used no other parliamentary entitlement elsewhere but still claimed for Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As John Faulkner indicated, we might believe up to six nights mistakenly claimed. How can we believe 43? I will make a prediction, Madam President. If you order your department to go through all the interstate claims and all the Canberra claims to seek evidence, this figure will go from 43 to 100. Clearly it will go that high. At the very least you would be fulfilling a public duty by ordering such an inquiry because the Collector of Public Moneys will be a major beneficiary and so will the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the issue of blame. Senator Hill has asked why any minister for administrative services had not done something about this years ago. Of course, he ignores the fact that travel allowance in this case is paid by the Department of the Senate and therefore it is its responsibility. He ignores the fact that there was no visibility on these claims until you, Madam President, reinforced President Beahan's decision&mdash;both of you to your credit&mdash;that there be full visibility for Senate claims. This is the reason why Senator Colston tried, in a sneaky way, to head this off by getting it referred to the Privacy Commissioner: because he could not undo all the claims he had made and therefore the visibility was there. Senator Hill has to be joking when he talks about DAS ministers. They did not pay the travel allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on that subject, DAS has done an inquiry. DAS has in fact put two pieces of advice to its minister. It has put the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2243"> accusations against Senator Colston to Senator Colston, and it did so as early as 5 March. It told the press that these matters would be tabled in the House of Representatives at the same time as this report was produced last week. But uh, oh, change of plans. Do senators know why there has been a change of plans? If senators think this report is red hot, they should see what DAS has found. It is five times as red hot as anything in this report. Naturally DAS will give Senator Colston until 18 April to respond, because that will keep him locked in here a lot longer than he otherwise should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one way I am not sure that that DAS report should be tabled here. I disagree with some colleagues. I think it should go straight to the Australian Federal Police and the prosecutor for his or her evaluation straightaway. Undoubtedly this Senate report should go to the AFP, and undoubtedly the inquiry should be broadened for the following reason in addition to the others I have outlined: the airlines and some staff in this building will not cooperate unless it is the Australian Federal Police making the inquiries. That fact is known. I do not think it will be contested. The airlines should and would be required by the Federal Police to examine these issues to a much wider extent than they have been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some peripheral issues here to do with travel allowance. I am still waiting for some sort of answer on what travel allowance was paid to Senator Colston by the Australian National University. They are like the Kremlin over there: maybe they are right; maybe they are wrong. All we know is that privacy rules say they cannot declare anything. We have Senator Colston's own words in the newspaper that he did in fact claim travel allowance from the ANU, but we do not know how much or when. He never declared that as a source of income on his pecuniary interest form. He did, however, say that he had given all that money to needy students. I want to know when he gave it to needy students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to know whether he deducted that off his tax. If he claimed off his tax the $145 that this parliament paid during all those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> times he double&hyphen;dipped, he would have received about $154 back. He was on a nice little earner, as Arthur Daly would say, of $295 a night by going to the Australian National University National Council and pretending to do regular regulations and ordinances committee work or some other work. He turned up at the external territories committee hearing for two minutes on a day he had claimed $145.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the defence of Senator Colston will be that these are merely a few series of mistakes. Given the background of the avarice of this individual and given the background of repeated offences&mdash;Senator Kernot was wrong; he has filled out at least four cheques, to my knowledge, but who's counting?&mdash;it is very hard to plead that this was because of poor bookkeeping, his staff mucked up or something else. This is the only individual who has been able to work out the complexity of claiming travel allowance on Norfolk Island, and those opposite are telling me he cannot fill out forms correctly when he has claimed 777 days in four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, send this to the Australian Federal Police. Wash your hands of it and send it straight to them now. Your clerk said he would give you advice on this. It has not been received yet, obviously. You should do that straightaway.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are also told is that a full and frank and believable explanation will be forthcoming. I am afraid we might all be disappointed here because we have not had a full, frank or believable explanation of these events involving some 43 days of claims which are not proper within the terms of the guidelines and, I say, not proper in terms of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a case where, quite clearly, the President has an obligation to refer these issues directly to the Federal Police. We have before us a senator who has yet to come into this chamber and explain his position. What an extraordinary proposition, that the Senator concerned has chosen not to come into this chamber and give a full account of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a senator with a PhD, but not a PhD in form filling. It might be a PhD in many other things, but not in form filling. We cannot expect a bloke like Senator Colston not to make a few wrong entries. Essentially, that is the claim being put before us. What it suggests is that his staff are responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senator said in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 16 March, two days before the last deadline for presentation to this chamber, that he believes he is innocent and will be cleared of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any wrongdoing by reports tabled in the parliament `this week'. He well knew that there was a letter to the President being drafted at that time seeking a further delay of one week. At the same time, he was telling the press that he would be cleared by those reports tabled in the chamber, reports that he had had for some weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He informed the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> that he had never attempted to be secretive. The evidence is quite to the contrary in respect of the way in which bookings were made, remade, cancelled and re-entered into the system. Throughout this report you see quite deliberate actions being taken to disguise the travel arrangements that in fact were made. The senator also says that when questions were raised, `I voluntarily submitted my records to the Department of the Senate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senator concerned sought these inquiries. He sought to cooperate with these inquiries. The report quite clearly indicates that there were 43 occasions on which payments were made which ought not to have been made. He also said on 16 March he that always checked his Senate staff himself. That was the claim made two days before the last deadline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, we see the explanation given today. What is the defence? The defence rests on the proposition that it was not his fault; it was his staff's fault. It was his long&hyphen;suffering staff. I have heard some pathetic explanations and weak claims being made, but to blame the staff I think has to be the worst. It is as good as the old one about always being misquoted in the press. It was not the things that you said; it was the way in which you were misquoted. It fits into that sort of category. In the documents before us today, Senator Colston acknowledges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not offer Mrs Smith's explanation as an excuse for these overpayments occurring. I accept that I am ultimately responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any claims which I have made. However, it is an explanation of how these overpayments occurred and clearly establishes that there has never been any intent on my part or any member of my staff to claim travel allowances for which I was not entitled.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the form indicates quite clearly&mdash;this is the form each and every one of us must fill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2247"> in&mdash;is a certification by the senator concerned. This form states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I certify that the information provided above is true and accurate and the claims I have made comply with the provisions of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 21 of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the basis on which the claims have been made for some years in this Senate. To turn around and suggest that the forms were filled in incorrectly by the senator himself and that they were based on information provided by staff, incorrectly, of course is not an appropriate basis on which to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Usher of the Black Rod made some comments in the public arena about these matters. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear, from the airline schedules from Senator Colston, that he was in one place when his travel allowance claims suggest that he was in another.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At this stage, the Usher indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the allegations can be proven on the documentations. I would imagine that Senator Colston has a case to answer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, nothing could be clearer than that statement. How accurate that statement is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this ultimately is about, however, is not just one senator rorting the system. It is not about one senator seeking to fraudulently make claims which he has no entitlement to make. It goes much deeper than that. It goes to the basis on which this government has behaved. It goes to the issue of the basis on which this government organised Senator Colston's defection from the Labor Party. It goes to the question of how the matter was arrived at in which this government was guaranteed its legislative program, in which a whole series of important pieces of legislation were to be able to gain passage through this chamber. It goes to the issue, ultimately, of the integrity of the Senate. That is why I put to you, Madam President, that the real issue here ultimately goes to that integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is your responsibility, I contend, that this matter be referred to the Federal Police. It is a matter that this government ought to take up, given that it is a government that asserts that it is interested in proper integrity and that its legislative program should be above question when it is carried by this chamber. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> You, Madam President, have the responsibility to ensure that senators behave properly and that the legislative program of this government is not corrupted by a process which we have seen in recent times.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is the sad truth. Christine Smith, this poor staffer, who has been set up to take the rap for this, may well have been responsible for some mistakes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I am rising in this debate purely and simply as a former chair of your regulations and ordinances committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It still does, Senator Hill&mdash;I took the trouble to inquire. I would not try to defend Senator Colston on this one, Senator Hill. In the 2&half; years that I chaired that committee, I do not believe that I can recall submitting a single claim for travelling allowance as chair of the committee. It never occurred to me to do so. There may have been a few nights for the rare conferences that the chairs of that committee have to attend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Kernot has already laid out, in 1995 Senator Colston made a whopping 36 nights claim on the regulations and ordinances committee&mdash;32 of those claims as chair of the committee. Is it possible&mdash;even remotely possible&mdash;that anyone could even come close to justifying that extent of claims on that committee? The answer is&mdash;and you know it, Madam President&mdash;that it is not. In the 10 years preceding Senator Colston's chairmanship of that committee, four other chairs submitted an average of two to three nights claims a year&mdash;that is in the decade prior to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2248"> Senator Colston. When Senator Colston took over that committee, as Senator Kernot has rightly said, he incrementally increased those claims until, in 1995, he put in a whopping 32 nights. There is a pattern there as well&mdash;Sunday, Monday; Sunday, Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, let me say this to you very directly,  and I am saying this to you directly as President: there are two high public offices in this place, and you know it&mdash;President and Deputy President. And they are high public offices indeed. I am not talking about Senator Colston remaining in here as a senator. I am addressing this debate purely and simply in his position as Deputy President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston deliberately and systematically defrauded his Senate entitlements as chairman of regulations and ordinances.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two committee reports I am tabling today have both domestic and international importance. Report 6 deals with the agreement between Australia and Singapore to locate a helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre, near Oakey in Queensland.  We recommend early ratification of this agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 7 is an omnibus report that examined a number of matters. The most significant being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2249"> Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and a double taxation agreement with Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Oakey Agreement covers the location of a Singaporean helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre to conduct helicopter flying training activities, supported by approximately 250 Republic of Singapore air force personnel and their dependents, and will include the establishment of purpose built on&hyphen;base at a cost to Singapore of approximately A$30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is wide spread support for this agreement amongst the local communities of Toowoomba and Oakey.  Both local councils believe that the presence of the Singaporeans will provide significant economic benefits to the local communities.  In addition to the A$30 million capital investment, on&hyphen;going annual maintenance requirements will be in the vicinity of A$5 million per year, with a further A$9 million per year injected into the economy through the expenditure of Singaporean salaries in the Oakey/Toowoomba area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence presented to the Committee by three individuals opposed the agreement.  We noted, however, that this opposition came from outside the Oakey/Toowoomba area.  Issues raised included concerns over religious allegiance and the stationing and training of foreign troops in Australia.  The Committee rejects completely any suggestion that the Singaporeans would not be welcome on the basis of race or religious affiliations.  We concluded that the evidence presented by the local communities supporting the agreement, and the benefits in general to Australia, far outweighed these objections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first issue dealt with in our 7th Report was Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, initiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in December 1996.  Binding treaty action was taken by the Minister in this case before a full fifteen sitting days had elapsed for parliamentary review of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the need for immediate action to avoid future funding obligations, it was not possible to consult fully with all interested organisations and firms before the decision was effected on 31 December 1996. However, the report emphasised that consultation ought to be undertaken before such decisions are announced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted other recent withdrawals from UNIDO, including Canada (1993), the United States of America (1995) and most recently, the United Kingdom (1997).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia first joined UNIDO in 1985 but in 1987 the Government of the day made the decision to withdraw from the organisation. In 1989 the Government agreed to review Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, and on the basis that organisational reform had occurred and that potential procurement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> activities were available to Australian firms, agreed to rejoin the organisation in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1996, UNIDO had a broad membership of 169 member states.  In the last twenty years, the organisation has fielded more than 16,000 projects and generated investment for nearly 2,000 joint industrial projects. While UNIDO focuses 40 per cent of its aid activities in Africa, more than a third of the organisation's technical cooperation expenditure is devoted to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee heard evidence not only from departmental representatives, but also from UNIDO and the principal industry beneficiary in Australia, Hassall and Associates Pty Ltd.  Departmental evidence indicated that membership of UNIDO was not considered to be making a contribution to Australia's priority development objectives, the impact of UNIDO country&hyphen;level programs remained unsatisfactory, and the funding obligation to UNIDO did not represent value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNIDO emphasised to the Committee that it felt membership of the organisation met both Australia's aid objectives and geopolitical interests.  While insisting that Australian firms would not be excluded from UNIDO procurement activities following the withdrawal, the organisation did concede that internal political pressure may influence the selection of future procurement sources.  As the major financial beneficiary, this issue was of concern to Hassall and Associates.  At the public hearing, the company articulated a concern that future opportunities to win UNIDO contacts would be severely restricted by Australia's decision to withdraw financial support from the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also acknowledged the significant reforms that have taken place within UNIDO, particularly in the areas of management processes and the reduction of administrative overheads.  However, apart from a relative small number of firms benefiting from Australia's membership of UNIDO, there have been very few other tangible procurement benefits resulting from membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore noted the governments decision to withdraw from UNIDO, but recommended that any savings from the withdrawal be redirected to other areas of the aid program where they can be more effectively utilised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the limited time remaining I would like to comment briefly on the double taxation agreement with Vietnam.  While the Committee supports early ratification of this agreement, I wish to stress that we were concerned over a number of issues.  These concerns included the lack of consultation between the Australian tax office and professional accounting bodies, and the quality of the National Interest Analysis (NIA) that accompanied the agreement.  We were particularly concerned that the NIA not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2250"> only omitted necessary information, but was also unduly complex and difficult to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also noted that this agreement excludes banking, insurance, accounting, auditing, and commercial services. The Committee concluded that, should Vietnam change its approach and amend its laws, which caused the exclusion, there should be a renewed effort through negotiation with Vietnam to remove this exclusion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I rise to support the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2254"> government's amendment. As I understand, in terms of what the common vernacular of people reading all these transcripts and listening to this may be, there are people in remote or regional areas of Australia, as Senator Allison quite rightly demonstrated, who have no access to any local untimed calls. Her amendment, which the government has adapted here, proposed that those people will have access to an untimed call to a service centre for the first time. I think this is a commendable initiative for the parliament, and the government has done well to pick it up. The opposition is very keen to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased, Minister, that you have given an undertaking in both this area and also another area which the Democrats raised, whereby someone who was in a defined local call zone in a rural area had to make an STD call to, say, another service centre in another local call zone in a rural area where their natural service centre was for local government, et cetera. The Democrat amendment initially enabled them to go from one call zone into another call zone within a certain radius for a local untimed call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in private discussions I have had, has indicated some technical difficulties in trying to deal with that. Though I think it is commendable what Senator Allison raised, it is clear that there are some really technical difficulties of trying to write into legislation those arrangements across from one local call zone to another where you might accidentally wipe out a lot of regional zones and might not achieve it, except at some significant cost to revenue as well as the capital cost of implementation of equipment for Telstra, who would have to bear it.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperation. I just wonder whether the government has any amendment to move in this area. There was a suggestion that you may be interested in having one. If you have, I would like to look at it. I do not think anything has been circulated. As the government does not appear to have an alternate proposal, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 216, page 172 (lines 21 to 23), omit paragraph (a).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the significance of this amendment is not explained on document sheet No. 443, I will explain it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment removes the distinction between `residential' and `business' for business data calls.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue raised its vigorous head at the Senate inquiry. As an opposition we made comment that we would support that, in the `local loop'&mdash;as it is called colloquially&mdash;where there is the local untimed call rate, there should not be a time charge put on ISP, Internet service providers, and other data information flowing between users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Telstra argued strenuously at the hearing that this will lead to congestion, overuse and a distortion in its charging rates and those of the system. Telstra said that in the end, through this unnecessary congestion and overuse because of there being this untimed local call rate for business, it may have to invest more money, keep charges up elsewhere and there may be an enforced cross&hyphen;subsidy coming from domestic users to subsidise business users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that evidence came before the Senate committee, it was immediately challenged by a range of witnesses. I do not expect the government or anybody else, myself included, to automatically agree with everything that was said by the witnesses who, when they came before the committee, disagreed with Telstra; I do not automatically say that they got it right either. But I do have to say that in the committee hearings Telstra, in my view, did not prove its case that congestion was about to clog up, close down and stop the telephone system in Australia through overuse of Internet providers and data information being transferred and communicated around in the local loop area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2255">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given by some of the other witnesses which showed, I think, that was not the case. For example, in response to the idea that Internet users would be clagging or clogging up the exchange, to use a non-technical term, some witnesses pointed out that so far most Internet users are active at times of the day when there is spare capacity in the telephone exchange; people are using their Internet connections during the late afternoon, into early evening, into late evening. The peak times for business through the telephone exchange, of course, are during business hours&mdash;late morning, early afternoon, after lunch, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far Telstra has not been able to show that those periods of high use by normal business were automatically being affected by the use of Internet providers and others. In fact, it was pointed out that Telstra was actually getting more business at times it had spare capacity in its telephone exchanges&mdash;that is, in late afternoon and early evening&mdash;and, therefore, that was beneficial for Telstra in that it was getting a better balanced revenue base on its investment. The people who said that may not be correct. But, certainly, I found that Telstra could not refute that evidence which was given by a number of witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the ISP people, the Internet service providers, do have a vested interest, their own self-interest. They do not want to get charged on the basis of timed calls in the local loop for accessing Internet. But, Minister, I also have to say that today is the day the government has released its small business statement, outlining a number of ways to promote small business. Internet over the next few years&mdash;as you yourself know and have said in a number of speeches&mdash;will be one of the big boons for small business in Australia and the world, enabling it to directly communicate its services and information to potential customers in a very cost efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we automatically start to charge now, before there is evidence to show overuse and congestion, we will be stifling the development of small business&mdash;a growth area for jobs in Australia; an area where the growth of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small business can be enhanced not only in the cities, but even in regional areas. Of course, when communicating from one call zone to another, a timed rate will be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition believe we should remove this distinction so that business people, such as Internet service providers, are guaranteed for the future until the government, on behalf of Telstra, can put evidence before us that there is congestion, overuse and abuse. Until that is proven, I do not think we should find them guilty. I do not think we should say, `Well, in three or five years time we think there will be congestion.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the evidence I have seen is that the growth which will occur in this area with Internet means that Telstra has a wonderful new business stream coming on which will be to its advantage in new revenue, in straight volumes, even at an untimed rate in the local loop. Telstra should be encouraging Internet service providers and those other services which are to come from the broadband and on&hyphen;line areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of the evidence was of concern to the opposition. I asked, `If you put a timed rate on data information, how do we know that a normal fax machine, using a normal voice telephony system in a local loop, would not be accidentally caught by a timed rate?' Again, it was unclear in the evidence from both Telstra and other experts&mdash;there was a dispute about it. I thought it would probably be a very popular thing for an opposition to accuse a government of accidentally forgetting this. But I do not think it would be good for the community to suddenly find that, although they presumed what was being faxed was within a local call zone&mdash;remember that, in the metropolitan areas of Australia in particular, that is one side of Sydney to the other, one side of Brisbane to the other, one side of Melbourne to the other, and so on&mdash;our putting in a device to catch business data transmission meant we could also accidentally catch fax machines operating at the local level, and that they were paying a timed rate. I have to say that would be something that would send a lot of small businesses broke. But, above all else, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2256"> many residential people are now operating their own faxes from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point in all this is the growth in the number of self&hyphen;employed people or micro&hyphen;businesses. I must say, as a former small business minister, that one of the most exciting developments in job growth in Australia is the number of micro&hyphen;businesses and the number of people working from home, particularly women. A higher proportion of women start micro&hyphen;businesses, are self&hyphen;employed and work from home. They have to have access to not only a telephone but also an on&hyphen;line fax. That will enable them make their businesses grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we ought to put the brakes on right now and say, `Well, we're going to start charging you a timed rate'&mdash;even accidentally&mdash;`for a normal fax machine.' Therefore, unless there is any other amendment for consideration, I believe this amendment is one of the most important amendments this chamber should support in favour of small business. As I said, the timing of the amendment is coincidental&mdash;on the day the government released a major statement to help small business. This amendment would be a very useful thing to support to help small businesses in the Australian community. I commend the amendment to the Australian Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

I thought it would be interesting today to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  some of the correspondence that has been received by all our offices on this matter of the Internet. I think this was one of the better ones. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra are pulling a shonky over timed Internet calls. At a recent Senate inquiry they threw in a big red herring. They showed proof that domestic call peaks coincide with Internet use. Well, so what? Domestic calls do not make a big difference to overall peaks. Internet traffic is just one per cent of the total domestic and exchanges are designed to carry 14 per cent of all local users at any one time. The real con lies here. The minister has said that local calls won't be timed&mdash;fine&mdash;but the telecoms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> act does not prevent Telstra timing business calls, nor does the minister's guidelines. Here's the catch: the telecoms act allows Telstra to charge for incoming calls. Since the Internet providers are business customers, Telstra can time the calls and charge accordingly. This cost will then be passed on to the users. So, in effect, the user pays once to establish the call and then pays by time&mdash;a huge con. Worse still is the fact that the minister is aware of this loophole. The red herrings at the inquiry were there to throw the senators off the scent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not wish to add too much more to the debate than that. We will support the opposition amendment, as I have already said.

<PARA STYLE="Para">What I was hoping to extract from Telstra is how they remove themselves from being in direct conflict with the ISPs by providing some sort of once-removed process to ensure that true competition could prevail. I think the response says a lot. Whilst it was not a direct answer to my question, it gave us an insight as to what we are dealing with in respect of this issue. The answer provided was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra's ISP service connects to Telstra's big pond direct service as a customer paying standard commercial rates in accordance with publicly available tariff, as do non-Telstra ISPs. It has multiple connections to several big pond direct points of presence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that says is that any customer, residential or small business, has the opportunity to connect to the big pond service on the same terms and conditions as an ISP. If this does not add an additional layer for ISPs in terms of competition, I do not know what does because, in addition to just providing an Internet access service, the ISPs give a lot more to the community than just that access point. What the ISPs provide is a whole range of content provision services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think to say that Telstra does not have an inherent advantage by virtue of the fact that it is providing an ISP service to the community&mdash;the same as the existing independent ISP services provided&mdash;but has no such way of accounting for that indicative layer in between the two points, shows that Telstra does have an advantage and that, if this amendment does not go through, it will perpetuate that advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, I ask you to look at it in that context. You need to go no further than what Telstra's own pricing policy is for the ISPs to show that there is, in fact, the potential for conflict. This does have the potential to put severe pressure on the ISPs and the services they provide. I know the ISPs can provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their pricing formulae in a whole range of different ways, but the bottom line is that they are competing for customers with Telstra, which is providing the same pricing regime to the ISPs as it is to customers direct. It really begs the question of the need for appropriate regulation to ensure that such calls cannot be timed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of all of this is that, once those timed calls are allowed on that local business data basis, that provides another layer of cost imposition upon customers, who may choose to go via their ISP as opposed to straight to Telstra's big pond service. So, by implementing a local timed data business call, there is the imposition of a direct disincentive to business for going through an independent ISP as opposed to going through Telstra's big pond Internet service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The imposition of that layer can be avoided quite specifically and quite easily by supporting this amendment. This amendment would ensure that Telstra cannot time those calls between the customer and the independent ISP. In the same way that this point goes to the heart of ensuring that Telstra and the ISPs are working on a level playing field, I think it is incumbent upon the government to also ensure that the health and the viability of ISPs is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, the other point I would like you to take on board quite specifically is what is contained in the report of the Senate inquiry. Quite specifically in that report is the point about Telstra arguing that there is overall congestion on the lines, and that is quite unequivocally rejected by the majority report. Minister, it was quite clear, as arising out of this report, that the government had acknowledged the evidence that was put before it and was not going to support the allowing of timed local data calls for businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I ask you to clarify, firstly, your views with respect to the majority report&mdash;if, indeed, you have taken on the advice provided in that majority report. Secondly, I ask for your views with respect to the pricing regime that is imposed by Telstra's big pond. Do you acknowledge that, if timed local data calls are to proceed for business, it does represent an additional layer of expense placed upon, and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That last argument is tantamount to saying: if a service is free, you have every incentive to use it, but the minute you impose any charge, it becomes a disincentive or an extra layer or a business burden. Yes, all of those things are true in one sense, but that does not mean that you are not justified in imposing a charge because there are costs incurred in providing that service. I think in a perfect world the pricing regime ought reflect the underlying cost structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report, as I understand it, only went so far as to suggest a review. It did not argue explicitly against what the government has consistently said on this issue; that is, that we would preserve the right of residential users of Internet services&mdash;and all data services for that matter&mdash;to have untimed local calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to business users&mdash;and we are not just talking about the Internet; we are talking about the high speed transfer of data through computers and the like&mdash;that does not clog up the lines by definition. Whether or not there is an ultimate congestion or whether the carrier simply goes on building more and more, if it is an untimed call&mdash;and, in theory, in 24 hours you can make a massive transfer of data for 25c&mdash;then someone has to pay for that. The mere fact that you can go out and build more capacity to absorb it does not for a moment mean that you are recouping your outlay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to us that a rational pricing regime will take account of not just the extent of the demand but also the capacity to pay. That is why it is our view that a clever country ought to be encouraging residential users, particularly families and kids, who want to get on to the Internet. You do that by going against the normal method of pricing, taking account of the time value of money or the money value of time, and, in that instance, giving them a special benefit&mdash;an untimed local call.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses&mdash;who by definition have the capacity to pay or they are out of business&mdash;are the ones who can afford to bear that burden, as long as it is not an oppressive price that is set.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not hear you distinguishing, on a consistent basis, residential from business consumers. You simply talked about ISPs servicing the market. To the extent that ISPs are responding to calls from residential users, that will still be an untimed call. It is only when they are responding to calls from businesses that you start to have a realistic cost burden imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking here about just small businesses; we are talking about businesses in general. No matter what the size of the business, you go into business knowing that you have got certain fixed overheads and you have got variable costs. You have to take account of your revenue and your level of customers and you pass on the costs and hope to make a profit at the end of the day. So there is nothing inherently wrong with imposing a cost burden on business, particularly where it reflects the underlying cost structure. It is not as if these calls are free irrespective of time.

I think you are saying there is not currently congestion but if there is credible evidence of a sign of it and, after an inquiry, you are satisfied there is real evidence of congestion acting in a way that is making it difficult, something should be done. It is a bit like directory assistance charges. The fact is that if you are forced to provide a service and you are not able to properly cost recover, you will find ways of making life fairly difficult.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go back to a few points that the minister made. Firstly, Minister, you criticised me for not being distinct when using the word `consumers' in relation to residential and business. The same generalisation was made in the context of the paragraph in the majority report that deals very specifically with this issue. It states, `The committee does not believe that the government should allow these guarantees to be exploited by some to the cost of consumers in general.' By the same token, I do generalise because you cannot create the distinction between residential and business because they are all potential clients of either ISP or big pond service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I would like to make relates to your comments with respect to the review. You claim that the government's position on this issue is that there will just be a review in 12 months. I believe your report is more specific than that and that it advocates quite clearly that the status quo remain and then a review be conducted to address issues of congestion that may arise at a later date. So 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I put to you that in fact your report quite specifically advocates that the status quo remain and those local timed data calls for business do not come into force or are not eligible to come into play if and when that review recommends that such calls be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you to comment specifically on that, particularly in the context that, for all the confusion that has arisen around this issue on behalf of the government's position, it has arisen because your report quite clearly indicates that you do not accept evidence advocating a move to timed local data calls for business but you acknowledge the need for a review based on the evidence put before you with respect to potential congestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I put to you is with respect to your quite glib response to competition policy and whether any serious concerns are raised with respect to the competitive nature of Telstra's big pond service when it is compared with the services offered by independent ISPs. I believe that those issues need to be resolved quite clearly now. When we have had representations from particular Internet service providers that they will be adversely affected, in the first instance, the government has an obligation to address that quite specifically and not just push it under the carpet, to be dealt with perhaps in all sorts of processes and really test the merits or otherwise of the ACCC's role in telecommunications down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that you have an obligation to resolve it before you get to that point because I do believe that there will be an adverse impact upon those businesses and that it would be in fact in your interest as the government to be able to anticipate that in a proactive and up-front way, particularly given that you have already indicated that you are going to review the situation in 12 months. Another 12 months to make sure that timed calls cannot be imposed could well save the 470 businesses that currently provide Internet services independently. To allow it to go ahead, if you do not support this amendment, could put in jeopardy those businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when you talk about the clever country, we are not just talking about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2261"> businesses that are clients to the ISPs not being able to afford the services but also talking specifically about the entities of these ISPs themselves and what they actually contribute to the industry. It has been demonstrated by their growth, by the number of people these small businesses employ and by the content provisions that they put into the system that indeed they are quite essential to the growth, to the diversity and to the strength of our national development on Internet technology, particularly with respect to content development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting&mdash;and this was a point well made in one of the recent commentaries on this issue&mdash;that basically these ISPs do provide more than just a connection with various pricing options for consumers, whether they be residential or business. They do provide this in the form of local content and Australian content. If this role is impinged upon, can you take into account when making your decision that a considerable source of independent Australian content comes forth from these ISPs? To jeopardise their future in any way jeopardises the potential source of Australian content on the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that an Internet backbone provider such as Telstra can replace the sort of independent content that I am talking about and that is produced by the independent ISPs. I put to you that the backbone providers, Telstra and others, are getting a bit of a free ride because they are the ones that on&hyphen;sell this content and benefit from people wanting to get onto the Internet. Whilst they are not putting too much back into it, they are making money out of people wanting to get onto the Internet. They are not contributing to the content provision, which is where the ISPs clearly have a role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point I would like to make relates to what the minister said about the big pond, pricing policies and clogging up the system. Congestion goes to the heart of the government's justification as to why this issue does not need to be addressed quite specifically. Telstra's policy on how they actually sell the bandwidth to the ISPs is not only on the basis of the actual bandwidth that is transferred but also on the basis of utilisation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> So usage is defined by them as the number of megabytes that are transferred but, with respect to utilisation, Telstra sell bandwidth on the basis that it becomes more expensive for ISPs if they use a greater amount of the bandwidth that they are eligible or able to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment Telstra's pricing regime operates on the basis of less than or equal to 40 per cent of the potential bandwidth that is available to ISPs. So Telstra have quite specifically built into their pricing structure for selling bandwidth from their backbone system to the ISPs a safeguard to ensure that congestion does not occur at that point. I acknowledge, Minister, that that does not address the claim about night&hyphen;time congestion from houses and so forth, but I think that has been dealt with in the report. It is an absolute misnomer to use congestion on those main lines from the backbone to the ISPs as the reason for allowing the government to pursue the notion of imposing timed local data calls for business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we do not need to go too much further than that to see just what a furphy the issue of congestion is. If we remove from this debate the arguments relating to congestion, there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the imposition of timed calls on business. So I think we are dealing with a whole range of issues, and you as a minister need to look quite specifically at what Telstra are offering and how that impinges upon the arguments they have used with you, and then relate that to the overall issue of competition policy and how that applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to this government: you have a responsibility to avoid stepping into what I see as a quagmire of challenges to that competition policy and you have an obligation to foster and promote a section of small business in the Australian economy that, as you and I have acknowledged on numerous occasions, really does have the potential to take our IT industry just that one step further in the pursuit of placing Australia at the forefront of Internet content development and service provision.</PARA></SPEECH>

Until they can be shown by Telstra to be clogging up the system and to be abusing it, that should be the case. We rest our position and we certainly commend this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to put on the record, Minister, that I think that, allowing for those arrangements of the ACCC, as this issue is not in the end either a disallowable instrument or coming back to parliament, when all other areas about untimed calls cannot be changed for domestic use and telephony, et cetera, unless they are referred to parliament, it is a bleak day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only chance the public or the business community or the on-line services or the Internet service providers have is to convince the ACCC&mdash;but only on a competition basis.

Though you say that the government would be cautious and review information coming in, the fact is, if they make an application to the ACCC, it is even out of your hands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is even worse. At least the minister had some discretion to make the decision. I want to finally ask: can you, Minister, make any determination or give any instruction to the ACCC when they are dealing with any application to charge for data information in the local call zone for business? Do you have any discretion to put a view to the ACCC that it is not just a competition issue; there are broader issues&mdash;we might claim in the national interest or in the economic interest of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think so, but the parliament has always got the right to amend legislation and to make changes if it thinks it is necessary. That is really all you are talking about&mdash;to have a power of disallowance. The exercise of ministerial discretion is simply saying that parliament ought to be able to have another go at an issue. All I am saying to you is see how this works out.

I think there might be some dangers in agreeing to this amendment because, given that that $4.5 million was for a four-year period, it might be a way of saying, `There is no need for us to make any judgments about whether or not transmission towers are problematic until we have finished this four-year study.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment seeks to make it compulsory for Telstra to file all its tariffs. This may not be a great issue for the large number of Australian telecommunications consumers, but in the balance of competition policy, which is much of the theme of this legislation, we think it is important that this amendment be moved. For a period of time post&hyphen;1 July, Telstra will be required to file all its tariff charges with what will become the ACCC. It has to be done at least seven days before imposing a new charge or varying a charge or ceasing to impose a charge. Telstra must give the commission, in a form approved in writing by the commission, a written statement setting out such information about Telstra's intentions as the commission requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is still the major dominant telecommunications organisation in Australia. It dominates the market in many areas, though so far, because of competition, it is now no longer seen as the dominant carrier in international areas and I think in some areas of what was called STD. Certainly in many other areas it is still the dominant carrier and has a major impact on the charging system and the pricing system. Because of its dominance in the market, it can vary tariffs from time to time that would give it a major advantage

<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, this amendment would not attract much interest in one form from the large number of telecommunications consumers in Australia. We believe that a competition notice should be dealt with by the Australian Competition Tribunal rather than by the ACCC itself. The reason we do this is that we believe that, on issues of competition, there are broader economic interests to be considered, not just narrow competition issues that the ACCC itself would deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot ignore the fact that Telstra and the issues surrounding telecommunications have a major economic impact on the provision of those services in Australia. We believe, therefore, that by putting it to the tribunal, which is a more balanced tribunal and has interests other than just a straight competition, it will be a better outcome in the balance for telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have tried to limit the ongoing legal costs and the propensity of the major carriers to sue each other at the drop of a hat. That is why we have the following words in our amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of decision to issue a competition notice&mdash;exemption from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Someone will point out that common law still exists and people will&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Common law has developed over the last 600 or 700 years. When common law started on these precedents in Great Britain they did not have a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> printing press, let alone a telephone. We will not get into a philosophic argument about the advantages and disadvantages of common law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not have a limit, we believe that both sides will sue each other endlessly to try to get a win on issues that will have a major economic advantage for a particular carrier. The real winners will not be the carriers; they will be the legal profession&mdash;QCs, silks, juniors and all those other solicitors, et cetera. Major law firms will keep advising their clients&mdash;the carriers&mdash;to keep suing each other right through to the High Court and back again. All that will do is make the legal profession richer and will not automatically mean that we get a better telecommunications system that is economically providing the best to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, on balance, this is the best way to go in this area. As I said, I certainly acknowledge that this is not an issue that in the broad community is a matter that people are fighting in the streets over, like untimed calls or directory assistance. We think, on balance, that it does put some restriction on the ability of carriers to endlessly waste the ACCC's time and the time of the legal system by endlessly suing each other to get a financial advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One reason the minister should consider supporting this in the process of the partial privatisation of Telstra is that this will mean that Telstra will spend a lot less money on legal fees and being taken to court by the other carriers at the drop of a hat. Therefore, we believe that the amendment is useful in a balance between competition and the economic interests of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will play precisely into the hands of the lawyers because you cannot remove the common law rights to take action on an administrative law basis. In other words, prerogative writs, as they are called, enable you to go right through the range of the courts. AD(JR) is simply a statutory form of administrative review. If you take away the statutory entitlement, they revert to common law and you achieve nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2273">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But all you would achieve would be the adding of an additional layer of complexity, and I am sure that the industry has pointed this out to you. A competition notice is simply a technical document that establishes a prima facie case; in other words, you do not have to get out there and prove that it is anti-competitive before then going along and having your big argument in court. Competition notice means that the ACCC has expressed its view, and then you go along to the AAT and have your argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to allow that administrative decision, if you like, to be appealed on a merits basis, then you are introducing a merits argument on a non-substantive issue. That is quite contrary to any principles of law. You can review something on a point of law. But to have a merits review means that you would start to have the argument about whether or not they are acting anti-competitively in the AAT, which is not where that discussion ought to take place at all. The ACCC issues a competition notice, which is a prima facie view, and then you have the argument. It is just to get thing off the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you want to have that very act of issuing a notice then referred off to a tribunal where you will have, presumably, if the carriers want to contest it, a lawyers' picnic. You can argue for weeks on whether or not they are acting anti-competitively&mdash;and all in aid of simply establishing the validity of a competition notice. It is going in very much the wrong direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very surprised if anyone with any legal competence has told you that this makes sense. I also would be amazed if the industry itself thinks that this does anything other than play into the hands of those who want to make the whole system much more complex and create layers which are simply designed to keep the lawyers well fed. I do not object to that in principle. But I thought you did; I thought you were always carrying on about how you thought we should take lawyers out of the system. You are going in precisely the opposite direction. This is a denial of all you have ever stood for, and you ought to be absolutely ashamed of yourself.</PARA>

We and the government have had a lot of discussion on this issue which we raised in our Senate minority report and have, as a result, circulated what I mentioned as document 423. The government has been involved in discussions with not only us but representatives of the service providers and as a result their amendments circulated as B97AU229 are the ones that we now support. I hope I have that correct. The advisers in the advisers box have nodded their heads that that is correct. We support the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a major issue at the Senate committee. It was dealt with at some length. The major concern of the service providers was that the carriers would reach agreement on their own interconnect arrangements on or before 1 July; they would not reach agreement with, then, carriers to the service providers; and the service providers would be in a no-win situation and would not be able to compete because they would not know the basis of their interconnect and access fee. I think these amendments put in place an arrangement that makes it fair for everybody. I support the government amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity at the end of the committee stage, which is now being reached&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;to place on record a few comments from the opposition about this process and about this monumental package of bills that I think goes back probably 2&half; years in preparation by the previous government through into the new government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that probably some&mdash;the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and maybe even the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;think that this process of the last week and a bit in committee stage went on far too long, particularly as there was a legislative committee reference. I believe that if we had not had the legislative committee reference, we would have been here for weeks in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the committee stage of the Senate as a whole was very responsible. The range of amendments, I think, were well focused, whether they came from the opposition, the Greens or the Democrats. I also have to say that it gave an opportunity for the government to table significant numbers of amendments in response to the predominantly unanimous recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in future, when we have complicated pieces of legislation or packages of bills, we should attempt to replicate that process. It would have been extremely messy in here without that process. I think that, although Senator Hill and others might think that this went on for far too long and it should have been much shorter, it was a very reasonable process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all I want to record my appreciation of the Senate Procedure Office for the preparation of the running sheet, without which we would never have got through this package of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2289"> bills. To Rosemary Laing and her staff&mdash;thank you. On behalf of the opposition, I want to thank the government for making available access to Mr Keith Byles to help draft the amendments that we moved so that they were technically correct even if in policy terms we still had some disagreements on them. I think that process facilitated this debate. I also want to thank Frank Nugent from the ERCA secretariat and the other staff for the work that they did to get this bill through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not often that I mention members of the government, but I certainly want to thank David Kennedy and Paul Fletcher from the minister's staff for the regular consultation and so on. I do this genuinely, because, again, there was a lot of give and take. We reached agreement on a lot of amendments, which I think were useful in the final outcome of the bill. I also want to thank Tony Shaw and all staff from DOCA&mdash;there are far too many of them to mention. Tony, you can pass on my thanks on behalf of the opposition for the work that you did, turning up to those Senate committee hearings when you were often the meat in the sandwich at the table explaining things. I think that was a very worthwhile process and it was very much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank Victor Franco from the Democrats, who has done a lot of the work for Senator Allison. I want to thank the other senators for their contributions. The give and take across the chamber, Minister, I think has been useful. This is a package that we probably 90 per cent agreed on before we started. The issues, I think, were worth debating. I think that the minister, Senator Allison, Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine all contributed to an improvement in the package. We will be back here, I suspect, at some stage in the next year or so with further amendments as this telecommunications industry and regulatory authority regime is being updated as technology continues to rip apart the best laid plans of all of us about what we think is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to thank my own personal staff, Jenny Fox, Cassandra Gelade and Alison Wood&hyphen;Pottle in particular, for putting up with me over the last six to eight 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months as we worked our way through the several hundred pages of this package. I want to place on record that I believe this has been a pretty constructive process which reflects well on the parliamentary process in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to add briefly to those remarks, because I think Senator Schacht has said it all pretty eloquently. I do not suppose that I should be heard by my colleagues to say that it all went according to plan. Apart from the length of time that was occupied, in many respects I think I would have to concede that it was inevitable that there would need to be, at times, vigorous discussion. I do think that, at the end of the day, it has been a very worthwhile process and one to which everyone has contributed constructively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to confess from my own point of view that, as the days wore on, and particularly towards the end of some particular days, my temper might have been a bit shorter than it should have been, and I apologise for that. I do think that, overall, everyone approached the debate in the right spirit. We should all be proud of the fact the we have participated in what is a pretty historic package of legislation which, as Senator Schacht says, probably will not last all that long. Nonetheless, this has been very important for the industry and for the community generally to understand that the parliament can handle what are at times very complex issues in a way that ultimately satisfies most of us in terms of the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate all the people Senator Schacht congratulated. Rosa Ferranda from the drafting office, particularly in relation to the running sheet, I think does deserve special mention. Speaking on behalf of Messrs Fletcher and Kennedy, both of whom are exceptionally talented, can I thank you for your generosity. They probably do not need to be reminded, but I think it is nice to have it on the public record.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how far I will get in this contribution. I did not get very far in the couple of minutes that were available to me before lunch and now I see that the clock is against me again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saying before lunch that the essence of this legislation is not, as those on the other side would have us believe, to take away rights from workers; the whole purpose of this legislation is to provide a framework which allows more choice. There are those on the other side who see choice as a bad thing. I disagree. The reason why choice is important in these matters of retirement savings is that it would be wilfully reckless of this parliament were we to merely say, `Every worker in this country must have their retirement savings locked up in a superannuation account with an industry superannuation fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I was making before lunch is quite simply this. We know that stock markets go up and stock markets go down. Industry superannuation funds have large portions of their savings held in the form of shares on the stock market. You do not have to be a genius to know that, if the market goes down, as everybody expects the market could well do either some time tomorrow or some time towards the end of the year, the value of people's superannuation goes down as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to say to people `We are not going to give you the benefit of a retirement savings account where the value of the savings is certain, where the value of the savings is secure' could be to condemn hundreds of thousands of Australians who are expecting to retire in the very near future to having less money than they would otherwise have had. That would be reckless of this parliament. That is why the legislation to pass these retirement savings accounts is very significant and should not be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More fundamentally, I think there is another issue&mdash;which is that the previous government created this vast superannuation industry, which is in many senses very inefficient in terms of the allocation of resources, and it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2291"> exists simply because government legislation says it must exist. Those on the other side say, `Because government legislation says it must exist, it has to be a good thing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that we on this side say is that there is a place for superannuation funds like the industry superannuation funds, but there is also a place for us to provide another mechanism to workers in this country to secure their savings and to secure their retirement income when it comes time for them to retire. That is the point of this legislation. We were prompted to go down this route when we saw the collapse of the ABC aggressive growth fund in the early nineties which grew by an aggressive negative 69 per cent in 12 months. That is what we are trying to protect against.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can scarcely believe that so few empowered senators so painlessly will move to disempower so many citizens so painfully. What we are seeing is the process of voting for euthanasia and against voluntary euthanasia. In this committee we have to look at the specifics that that process involves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech, when referring to the contention that Australian doctors perform voluntary euthanasia, Senator Herron, who is hosting this bill, said, `I have never seen it. I would ask those who propound such a statement to produce the evidence. It does not exist. I know it does not exist. It does not occur.' I ask Senator Herron, through you, Mr Chairman: is that still the case?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask him: has he not been acquainted with the evidence in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> in February this year, the survey which indicates that some 4,400 Australians a year are helped to an early death because of the consideration of their doctors&mdash;without their request, without a dialogue and, because of the illegality of it, without the ability to be the arbiter of the way in which they will die? It is being left to the doctor. That is what is being voted for here tonight: a denial of the individual's rights. As one other doctor said, death has become the prerogative of the priests and the doctors in our society, and what they are worried about with voluntary euthanasia is the patient wanting to muscle in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on that territory. I submit that the citizen ought to be able to not only muscle in but also be arbiter of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Herron: are you not acquainted with the asseveration known around the country, published in Victoria in 1995 by seven doctors&mdash;including an oncologist, a cancer specialist&mdash;that they do perform acts which are effectively euthanasia in helping their patients to avoid the pain, the indignity and the suffering that does come before many deaths that Australians endure, despite the best availability of palliative care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you: do you stick to those words of yours, that euthanasia is venal and dangerous, and yet vote to support euthanasia remaining rampant in this country compared to jurisdictions like the Netherlands because it is not codified, because nationally we do not have the gumption of the Northern Territory legislators? They have codified what is commonplace practice and in doing so have returned from the doctors to the patient the right to be arbiter, to be the determinant, to make up their own minds for themselves in the matter of dying. I ask you: do you stick by those ugly comparisons you made, in respect of the thousands of doctors around this country who, in the absence of a codified law, do help their patients to an easier death&mdash;that there is an analogy between them and doctors convicted in the Nuremberg trials? It is those sorts of ugly and dastardly comparisons that have blighted this debate and left the popular will in this country unrepresented so far in the deliberations of the majority of both houses of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I ask Senator Herron: do you not accept the clear evidence there now is that the rate of euthanasia&mdash;not voluntary but performed by doctors without patient consultation&mdash;is much higher in Australia than it is in the Netherlands, where the voluntary option is readily available?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I just heard an interjection saying, `Good,' and that is the reason I rise now. The reason I am rising is that Senator Brown has circulated some important amendments which I know people have got very mixed feelings about in this chamber. I may be wrong about this but I really fear that the longer Senator Brown talks, if he wants to be combative, the less support those amendments are going to get. I thought I had divined the mood of the chamber on that fairly well. That is the reason I am rising now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be supporting Senator Brown's transitional amendments, as opposed as I am to euthanasia, and there is a very good reason for this. Can I tell you that I understand fully the arguments of people&mdash;and I have had discussions with a number of them today&mdash;who say that this is a matter that is either right or wrong. I fully respect the views of people who hold that position, that if it is wrong it is wrong. If the will of the Senate is that the Andrews bill should prevail and that this act which is currently lawful in the Northern Territory should as a result become unlawful, then for those people, as someone 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said to me earlier today, there is no middle ground on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to God that issues like this were as black and white for me as they are for other people. I am sincere about that&mdash;they are not with me. I have to say this: there are two people in the Northern Territory who have availed themselves of all the requirements of this act, as opposed to it as I am. They have done that to this current point in time and, as we speak, lawfully. They are lawfully able to take that horrendous decision, from my perspective, of taking their own lives. Those two people are terminally ill. There is no question about that. They are not in that middle ground of patients that concerns me&mdash;aged patients, for example. They are terminally ill patients. They and their families have no doubt been through personally horrendous processes in coming to this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not want to take that act now or in the next 24 hours or even in the next week. They have availed themselves of the currently lawful processes of this act so that, at a time of their choosing, they may end their own lives. I say `may', because there is no absolute guarantee, of course, that at the last minute they will. But I must say something which should, I think, occupy the minds of everybody in here: if we vote this transitional clause down and if the third reading vote reflects the second reading vote we have just had&mdash;it may not, but I am not going to run that risk&mdash;those people, in my view, will possibly choose to take their lives earlier than they would have otherwise. I think it is probable, considering the agony of decision they have been through already. I think there is a high probability that they may choose, even by one minute, to advance the time of their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something about which I can assure you, whatever my views, I am not comfortable at all. I certainly do not want to walk out of here tonight knowing that two people will kill themselves tomorrow as a result of the Senate vote. For that reason, I will be supporting the transitional clauses that Senator Brown is moving. I urge all other senators, whatever their views on this issue, to do the same. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dealing first with the amendment that Senator Brown has moved in relation to what we would call a `sunset clause', might I bring to the committee's attention a matter which the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee touched on in its hearings. It can be found on page 37 of its report. It dealt with the question of the Euthanasia Laws Bill and how it affected the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the questions raised was: was the Commonwealth, in effect, repealing a law of the Northern Territory or was it simply suppressing the law, as such, so that whilst the Andrews bill&mdash;as this bill has come to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> known&mdash;was in force the territory law would be suppressed? Paragraph 4.58 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The result of the enactment of the Bill would therefore seem to be to leave the RTI Act lying dormant on the NT statute book. It would revive if the Bill were to be repealed. It might also revive were the Northern Territory to become a State.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I see it this sunset clause is saying, `Well, this bill would have a life of two years.' As I understand it, it is clause 2 that Senator Brown wants to amend to say that this will only be effective for two years unless repealed sooner. That would mean in accordance with those paragraphs from the committee's report that this bill would effectively suppress the Northern Territory legislation for that period of time, and then that legislation in the Northern Territory would revive of its own motion&mdash;of its own will, if you like&mdash;when this piece of federal legislation expires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, I believe, is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. There are a couple of things that arise from that. Were the second amendment to be passed with this it would mean that someone could obtain a certificate in the Northern Territory allowing them to use the provisions of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. They could then sit on it for two years until that act was revived and the life of this piece of legislation had been extinguished. That would be an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs. But, even without that second amendment, you still have a situation where the legislation in the territory could revive itself. I believe that this is a cynical exercise. It is not a desirable one. You either allow it to continue or you do not. You do not have a suppression for a period of time before it automatically revives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second amendment, I believe that there are problems with a person obtaining a certificate allowing them to use the provisions of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, but then sitting on that certificate if they so wish. That is an absurd result; one which I think is quite unsatisfactory in a legal sense. I reserve other remarks in relation to the second amendment to a later time.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will come back to those amendments shortly but, in brief, let me put it to the committee that Senator Collins is right. If the second reading vote is reflected in the third reading vote, we have an essential overriding of the Northern Territory laws. Everybody understands that. There are two patients, as is on the public record, who have gone through the whole process of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 provisions for voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two people are both territorians. Both are dying. Indeed, they are close to death. Both are suffering enormously. Both have&mdash;after a long process with their medical attendants, after consultation with their loved ones, after deep consideration and reflection, as is required by the Northern Territory legislation&mdash;completed all the formalities which enable them to end their suffering at a time that they are best able to contemplate. That is their wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, from the short-term workings of this legislation, that it has worked properly. For those patients who have taken the option of voluntary euthanasia, it has been something which has relieved them enormously in their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time of dying. It is something that their spouses, their partners, their next of kin, have subsequently endorsed and called for as a measure available to other people in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put to the committee this factor: there has been a strong argument from those in favour of the Andrews legislation, overriding the Northern Territory legislation, that we ought not be codifying voluntary euthanasia, that we ought be leaving it to the current common law practice&mdash;illegal as it might be for doctors to make the determination&mdash;and that the law in some way ought not intervene on the doctor-patient relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have very clearly&mdash;if my amendment is not put through&mdash;this committee, this Senate, this parliament, intervening very directly into the doctor-patient relationship. That will rupture a decision made at the behest of the patient with her/his doctors, including the medical specialists involved, if we say, `Retrospectively that agreement is null and void. We will not allow you this option of a dignified death, an end to your pain, as you want. We are going to intervene specifically as far as you two people are concerned. We are going to intervene on your doctor-patient relationship. We are going to countermand your wish, and the wish of your loved ones, that you be unable to put an end to your suffering in your own good time. We know better in this place. We ordain. That option is taken from you and you will suffer. You will suffer because we say so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I plead with this committee to recognise the gravity of that situation. I plead with members who have voted for this legislation not to tie these people, as they have already suffered, into more suffering because you vote for it. I plead with you to think of the specific circumstances of these good folk who have made their own determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you to consider this: how could we say, `You can't make that decision. We are voting to end your option to end your own suffering. We are voting that you must suffer&mdash;as you do not want to&mdash;the indignity, the pain, the unacceptability of your dying days.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot says that they have signed. You have said in your commentary, Senator Kernot, `to the best of our knowledge'. How do we know that there are only two? It might be a dozen; it might be two dozen. We simply do not know. There is no public register of these people. We do not know whether or not this is genuine. I ask those who are genuinely interested to turn to section 7(1)(i) of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, to which Senator Brown's amendment refers. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The patient or person acting on the patient's behalf, in accordance with section 9, has, not earlier than seven days after the patient has indicated to his or her medical practitioner, as referred to in paragraph (f), signed that part of the certificate of request required to be completed by or on behalf of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is only one of a whole lot of steps under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act that have to be effected prior to somebody being able to avail themselves of the provisions of this act. Senator Brown's amendment, as I read it, does not even require the doctor's witnessing signature to it. Those of us who have an intimate knowledge of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act should look at, for example, section 8 subsection (2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a patient has requested assistance under this act and has subsequently been provided with palliative care that brings about the remission of the patient's pain or suffering, the medical practitioner shall not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and it goes on. But it then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If subsequently the palliative care ceases to alleviate the patient's pain and suffering to levels acceptable to the patient, the medical practitioner may continue to assist the patient under this act only if the patient indicates to the medical practitioner the patient's wish to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no formal requirement with this intention to proceed after they have gone into remission or palliative care has assisted. So we have a circumstance which could apply, under Senator Brown's proposal, to an unknown number of people. In fact one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people possibly could last with complete remission for three, four or five years. That is a possibility. That possibility is countenanced in the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. It is countenanced that that might happen. If that happens, despite us having said that we as a Senate are opposed to euthanasia, somebody might still be able to access the provisions of this legislation two or three years down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I understand the emotional arguments&mdash;I do not dismiss them just because they are emotional; I understand them, Senator Brown and Senator Collins&mdash;I would ask honourable senators to look at the detailed provision of Senator Brown's amendment and then see what its implications are in real life and in practice. I have to say to honourable senators that the impact of this amendment is a lot, lot wider than has been put to us by those supporting the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply indicate that the Andrews' bill has been on the public agenda now for how long&mdash;six months or more? I think it was introduced into the House of Representatives by Mr Andrews on 9 September 1996. It got carried in the House of Representatives on 9 December 1996. It has been around for a substantial period of time and I think those who are intimately interested in the provisions of this legislation were alerted to the fact that there may be a change in the law some sixth months or earlier. Given that, I think this legislation falls into a different category than if we were to spring it on the Australian community without warning. That needs to be kept in mind when considering amendments 2 and 3 moved by Senator Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that the amendment for transitional provisions moved by Senator Brown does not state the number of people. Although we are being told it is only two people, there is no proof, no guarantee, of that. In fact, many others could sign up prior to royal assent, so I am not convinced that we are dealing with only two people. It may be any number of people. There might be people signed up with doctors other than Dr Nitschke who, for whatever reason, do not wish to go public on this issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before&mdash;and this is a very important aspect&mdash;Senator Brown's amendment relies on only those people who have signed the certificate in section 7(1)(i).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw honourable senators' attention to section 17 of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think few people in this chamber would not agree that this is one of those matters where, if it is going to be done, it is best that it be done quickly, for the reasons that senators on both sides have enunciated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz may be able to say there might be 10 or 12, but the reality is there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2302"> two. There is no way we can end that disputation. I say there are two&mdash;and, as Senator Crowley said by way of interjection, so what if there are five? The question is: what if? But the fact is there are two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From what Senator Collins has said, the passage of the bill, with or without this amendment, is going to see it enacted within a couple of days, if not less. Those two folk in those tragic circumstances in the Northern Territory have had the necessary consultations with their doctors and specialists in order to comply with the law to give them that option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again: how can we as individuals or as a committee interpolate ourselves into that doctor-patient relationship, into the heart-rending circumstances of those people who are dying and suffering, and say, `No. We know better down here in Canberra, on this late night sitting, about your circumstances. We know better than you do, than your doctors do, than your loved ones do, and we say you should continue to suffer because we think that is a reasonable outcome.' Well, I don't think it is. I think that is a heartless outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can listen to legal intricacies and doubt being sown by Senator Abetz, but it does not alter the circumstances of those two people. We can hear the offer that they go to the Sisters of Charity or somewhere else, but these are people who have had palliative care options available to them and they do not want to be shunted off somewhere else by the suggestion of a senator in here. They want to die with their loved ones, where they are, under the circumstances they have worked out. Unlike most of us, they are dying tonight. They are suffering tonight. They have made their determinations in the last few days or weeks about how they want to handle their suffering and their indignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that plea again to some of you who have voted for the generality that there be no voluntary euthanasia available to the citizens of the Northern Territory, even though their legislature has accorded them that right. Do not move into the homes, the bedrooms and the dying circumstances of these two people and their families and say retrospectively, `We are going to override your signature on

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just one small point. I do believe that Senator Ellison is not correct in his understanding here. Even if this bill is defeated tonight, and even if the transitional arrangements are defeated tonight, people in the Northern Territory, or anywhere in Australia who go to the Northern Territory, will be under the law until royal assent signs this

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard much tonight about retrospectivity. I think what Senator Bob Collins pointed out tonight is right. In a sense, without the transitional arrangements as proposed by Senator Brown, under the law of the Northern Territory as it exists, having been democratically decided by that parliament, people who have indicated that at some stage in the near to intermediate future they want to die, to save themselves the pain, will quite simply have their choice retrospectively changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been interested that in this chamber the one thing that will get most Liberal members of parliament absolutely excited is any effort to retrospectively change the law, particularly on tax matters. I had a very minor amendment on retrospectivity to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. From the screaming and the shouting from Liberal members, you would have thought that I had brought the whole palace down on top of me! This was changing the rules after people had already claimed the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;even though it was clearly being rorted&mdash;and making sure that three companies could not go back and claim $80 million worth of diesel fuel rebate back to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the government, when I was customs minister, proposed. It was vigorously 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposed by every member of the Liberal Party and the National Party as something terrible. They said, `This is retrospectivity. How dare you tax and take money off people when they thought they were acting under the customs bill at that time.' Now, when two people's lives are at stake and they have made a choice, retrospectively we are saying here, `Stiff, you can't do it. We are interposing in the meantime. Retrospectively we're changing your choice.' They knowingly made that decision under a democratically elected parliament of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I deplore the humbug about retrospectivity from people opposite. I am more than happy to point it out. You are quite willing to argue to save a tax bill. You say, `It's awful that a company may have to pay more tax retrospectively,' but you assert that two people who have made a decision under the law cannot choose to have that decision flow through. I find that humbug appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that what Senator Brown has proposed is quite a reasonable transitional arrangement. Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison have issues such as: `We are not sure whether people have filled in the right papers,' or `It may take a few days to get royal assent,' or `Other sneaky people who are dying may rush to the Northern Territory and take the decision capriciously to end their lives.' That really is putting ordinary people in Australia down. To say that capriciously, and because there might be a gap of a few days, people will rush to the Northern Territory and say, `Hallelujah! I'm saved. I'm going to die before royal assent is given' is a joke. It demeans this debate on euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no bones about the fact that I strongly support the right of voluntary euthanasia, not just in the Northern Territory but in Australia, full stop. I can imagine the media in the next few days if this bill goes through without this transitional arrangement. Can you imagine what will be in the media? Photographs of these two people. They will be there in some awful interview saying, `Why wouldn't they let me have my choice? Thirty&hyphen;eight senators want me to die in agony.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the moral dimension and the argument, but that is what they will be saying. People in the community will say, `What is going on in this parliament of Australia? Two people who genuinely made a decision under the law as it existed have had that right retrospectively taken away from them.' I have to say that that will do no good to the standing of the Australian parliament. Retrospectivity in respect of the diesel fuel rebate is nothing compared to the image of retrospectively removing the choice from these two people. I say to Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison that, if a couple more people actually use it before the royal assent takes place, they made a knowing choice. I do not think it is going to damage the fabric of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude on this point: we should not be governed overwhelmingly by public opinion polls. On the issue of capital punishment, probably 50 per cent or 60 per cent of people in Australia are in favour of the re-introduction of capital punishment. I certainly strongly oppose capital punishment. But I have seen very few issues in my 30 years in public life where 80 per cent of ordinary citizens are in favour. Eighty per cent of Australians are in favour of voluntary euthanasia. I wish we could get that vote for the Labor Party. I wish we could get 80 per cent for any issue. I cannot recollect any issue of controversy having such genuine support across the community, across party boundaries, across ethnic and religious divides, across geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. It really is extraordinary. Seventy per cent to 80 per cent of Australians think it is not unreasonable that, if you are experiencing great suffering, you have a right to die with some dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two people have made a choice, under the law as it stands now, and this parliament is going to dishonour that choice. That will be an extraordinary record for this parliament, particularly for this Senate. I support amendments Nos 2 and 3 moved by Senator Brown.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in respect of the matters that we are talking about, let me just put it to you this way. In respect of retrospectivity, if, for example there is a contract made between a worker and an employer and that contract is legal at a particular time and it is absolutely substandard and is, in effect, slave labour&mdash;it could happen, to be quite frank, under&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to say under current industrial relations law and then there was a change of government and that was removed, do you think it would be appropriate to say it would be retrospective to cover those sorts of slave labour situations? Of course, it would not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, if there were a situation where there was slavery, let me make this point to you: two rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&mdash;and there are more rights&mdash;are inalienable; that is, the right to life and the right to liberty. As to the latter, that means that, even though you do sell yourself into slavery, that cannot be recognised in law. The same with the inalienable right to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those things ought to be considered because it is important that society and individuals recognise that. You talk about the public opinion polls; if the public were asked, `Do you agree that a doctor should be able to intentionally take the life of a patient who has requested it?' then the result, I believe, would be different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in respect of these amendments, there is a problem. There is no register of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2305"> who has decided to make requests under the Northern Territory legislation. There would be no way to ascertain the effect of these amendments if they were adopted. There could be a situation where certificates are backdated and it would be very difficult without a register to combat the backdating of certificates of request. This would be particularly so when you have a doctor like Dr Nitschke who says, `I do not care about the law. I am going ahead anyhow. I am prepared to break the law.' That is his view; that is his publicly stated position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Northern Territory legislation, the coroner has no jurisdiction to investigate any deaths as long as the paperwork is in order and no other matter which has come to his attention makes him suspect that the act has not been complied with.

If Senator Harradine, as he is doing, is extending that inalienable right to life, guaranteed by international covenant on which this parliament relies for its laws for its constitutional validity, if that is true and does apply to euthanasia, it would be absolutely open to this parliament to do precisely what my amendment suggested and pass a law that would apply to the whole of Australia and not simply to the Northern Territory.</PARA>

Let us say that a territory passed a law making capital punishment legal and that we passed a law such as the one tonight saying that from now on capital punishment is illegal. Would people get up and say, `Because the process has been put into operation, the consequences of that process should follow?' What we are making illegal is the consequences of what has been lawful until now. This is not a retrospective provision. It might be a harsh provision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make is that, when you talk about two people, you talk about them as only two people. In my view, every life is important. Two people's lives, if you take the point of view that we do, are very important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not make a habit of jumping up after each intervention by Senator Cooney. This time I will not seek to defend him either. I am going to slightly disagree with what he has to say without taking him directly or head on. I also want to make some comments about what Senator Harradine had to say on public opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the committee does not pass the amendment that we are now debating, we will be effectively depriving two individuals who are competent to make decisions for themselves of the right to have a good death or a gentle death or an easy death. That is what we will be denying them. We will be making that decision. We will be taking away from them the right to have a good death, a gentle death or an easy death. Irrespective of how long we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2307"> debate the matter, we will not be depriving them of their right to take their own life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney has argued that the provision should apply to everybody. I do not know how we would include everybody, other than going back and revisiting earlier votes. Despite my personal wishes, I do not believe that the committee will do that. We are not going to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know the two people that we are talking about. However, we know that there are at least two people who want to take advantage of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory. We know that they are in existence. I certainly believe that they have made their own conscience decision to do it. I do not know what physical condition those people are in or whether they were able to take their own lives. I certainly know, from reading the last note of the late Bob Dent, that he was not in a position to take his own life. He could not even write his own death note; that very moving note that was published just after he passed away last year. He had to get his wife to do it. It was a very descriptive and moving note. It certainly had a huge impact on me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that moved me&mdash;that actually shocked me&mdash;was the figures that Mr Marshall Perron gave to the Senate committee when it took evidence in Darwin of the number of suicides that occurred by people who were aged 75 years and older in the five-year period 1990 to 1994. Those figures shocked me. There were 672 people officially recorded as having suicided. These were elderly Australians who had probably made enormous contributions to Australian life and who ended it by the following means: 171 of them hanged themselves, 17 of them used agricultural chemicals to end their lives, two people used corrosive or caustic substances, 130 used firearms on themselves, 14 of them using cutting and piercing instruments, and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 672 people aged 75 years and older who ended their lives like that. Of those 672, 137 were aged 85 or older. They are shocking figures. They really are shocking figures that ought to shame Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two people we are talking about are nameless as far as I am concerned; I have not met them. Are we going to condemn them to the same end as those 672 others? At least can we not have some compassion in our hearts at this time to give those two people their stated wish to have an easy and gentle death, one that they choose for themselves and in the manner in which they choose. We have certainly condemned a whole number of others to dramatic deaths, as shown from the figures that I illustrated before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said I wanted to make some comments about the matter of public opinion which Senator Harradine addressed. I have not been one of the people through this debate who has formulated in my mind what I thought public opinion was. I have not to the best of my knowledge in any of the public hearings, in any of the conversations I have had or in any of the letters that I wrote&mdash;there have certainly been over 1,000&mdash;used the stated public opinion polls of who is in favour or who is not in favour. I am not sure what the figures are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like most politicians, I have an inherent distrust of public opinion polls because I know that the questions can be framed in different ways. For that reason, earlier this evening I supported the proposition that this bill ought to be the subject of a properly constituted referendum of the people of Australia. I supported that. I was defeated in that move. The majority of the Senate voted the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have deprived ourselves of finding out what public opinion is on this bill. Certainly, the number of submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee were overwhelmingly in support of the Andrews bill but they, in turn, need some analysis. I have not done the analysis; I do not think it is up to me. I do not have the time to do that analysis. Certainly the hardworking team of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, under the stewardship of Neil Bessell, does not have the time or, indeed, the resources to do the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I did do and what I indicated in my speech on the second reading was some of my own analysis as my responsibility as a politi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2308"> cian and as a representative of the electors of Western Australia. Some of those people&mdash;not everyone&mdash;who wrote to me, including the author of the one-page letter I read out during the second reading debate, I did ring back. Some of them gave me a phone number. I also phoned some of the others who did not leave a phone number. I did some checking through the phone book and found the numbers of some of them. I talked to them, not to convince them against the view that they had put to me, but to recognise at first&hyphen;hand&mdash;I do this reasonably frequently&mdash;that I had received their letter and I understood their concerns but I wanted to find out where they were coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that latter point, I was bitterly disappointed. Most of the people&mdash;I must say, it was not in the hundreds&mdash;that I spoke to did not understand what the Andrews bill was about. They knew it was called the Andrews bill but they did not understand what the Andrews bill was about. Most of the people thought that the parliament of Australia, through the Senate, was bringing in a bill to make the killing of older people unlawful. That is what they thought. I tried to reassure them on that. In most cases I was not able to; they had it set in their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech on the second reading I condemned the people who misled the public in that way. I still stand by that condemnation. Now is not the time to further that debate. We have very important matters to debate in the committee stage of the bill. In talking about public opinion on the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act and the Euthanasia Laws Bill, I felt it important enough to again make a contribution to the debate in order to attempt to put some of the record straight on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That amendment is meant to at least allow the apparent majority in this parliament, which is overriding the preponderant majority of citizens of Australia, to think again, because this amendment, in effect, would say that, two years from now, this Euthanasia Laws Bill would cease to have effect unless another similar bill is put through this parliament. In other words, two years down the line, let you who have voted for this legislation reflect on what you have done tonight. If you are confident that the actions of this parliament against the feelings of this nation are correct, let you have the confidence to do it again in front of the people of Australia that you are set to represent two years down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could you, majority, if that is the vote that is coming, say, `Not only do we override the elected representatives of the Northern Territory; we also override the 75 per cent or more of Australians who in every opinion poll say, "We want the option of voluntary euthanasia for ourselves"'? Those polls specifically say that, `at a patient's request, a doctor gives a lethal dose to end the person's suffering'. How could you say to two individuals whom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2310"> you do not know about, but whom you ought to have the compassion to relate to, that, notwithstanding their wish, after reflection and after having signed the necessary documentation, to die with some peace and to avoid some of the terrible suffering they are facing: `We will not let you do it.

Notwithstanding your pain, your suffering and your indignity, we&mdash;as people in this chamber in Canberra elected to represent you&mdash;override your fundamental wish in this, your dying hour'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a moment of shame on this Senate and this parliament. It is a moment of failure to connect with the compassion of the Australian people. It is a moment of great indignity&mdash;an abrogation of the democratic process as I see it. I have heard the arguments and I have listened to the debate. But, at the end of the day, if the majority continues to prevail we are not only voting here to fail miserably in our obligation of compassion to two adults who know their own minds and who are dying, we are also failing to connect in a compassionate way with the 18 million people that we represent and to say to them, `You have a right to determine matters of great importance, not least the mode of your dying when the hour is nigh, you have no alternative and you are suffering for yourself.' There is in this an arrogance and a disdain and a failure of compassion which I think is probably unprecedented in this parliament. However, that may be. I now want to test this committee and this Senate to face the people, to face the reaction of this decision two years hence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are confident you are doing the right thing tonight, then show that confidence and that self&hyphen;assuredness by saying, `We'll accept the sunset clause for this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, unfortunately, we are on broadcast. There are people in the gallery, and I would not want them to go away from this debate thinking that the term `intentional killing' and other terms have not been looked at with a great degree of thought by the Senate committee, which Senator Ellison chaired and then, at the latter stages, I chaired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of intentional killing was discussed at some considerable length. There were two basic views that could be adopted: one was the narrow meaning; the other was the broader meaning. Some people postulated that the broader meaning might be adopted, but not a single person argued for the proposition that, as a matter of good public policy, the broader meaning, in fact, ought be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I do not want to delay the committee any longer, because these issues have been dealt with at length. For those who are genuinely interested, it is all here in the report. But, at the end of the day, what did Mr Dabb say about the bill? He said:</PARA>

Even our constitution is being argued about every single day in the High Court after&mdash;what?&mdash;96 years. You will never get it absolutely certain until such time as there is judicial interpretation of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to those who take the view that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act ought be supported, it also has a lot of uncertain terminology in it which was explored at great length in the Northern Territory, which was that part of the hearing which Senator Brown, in fact, did not attend.

In the committee report, which was presented to this chamber very recently, collectively we had this to say. Point 4.33, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, any attempt to state exactly what actions are justified leads back to the general uncertainties in this area of the law that have already been referred to.</PARA>

I would like to indicate to the committee that it is the view of those who support this measure&mdash;though they can reject that if they wish&mdash;that there are only two views you can take about the word `intentional': one is the broad view and one is the narrow view. That has been made perfectly clear by those others who have contributed to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the court will be strongly guided in interpreting the legislation by what the explanatory memorandum says and what we are saying about it. During the hearings, in response to a question by Senator Abetz, Mr Dabb said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think a court would probably approach this by saying, `I have to get at the intention of the Commonwealth parliament in saying this. What really was the intention of the Commonwealth parliament?' If every speaker who had spoken in support of the bill said, `Our clear understanding and purpose is that intentional killing has a narrow meaning so it only catches an act for the purpose of killing,' then I think that is likely to be a decisive consideration on how a court interpreted it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is perfectly clear. Therefore, there is no problem of uncertainty. Senators who are supporting the bill need only to continue to confirm in the debate&mdash;as I am doing, and as I believe those speakers who are supporting the bill in this particular response to Senator Brown are doing&mdash;what should be obvious anyhow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be obvious that we intend the word `intention' to have its narrow meaning, and that is what we consider the bill to say. If Mr Dabb is correct&mdash;I am sure he is&mdash;that what is said in this debate will be taken into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2313"> account by any judge, then they would take into account that the word `intention' is to have its narrow meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is leading to a possible amendment to the bill, I do not believe that there is any need to amend the bill. The law traditionally uses the word `intention' rather than `purpose' in criminal law. Provided it is given the narrow meaning, the word is as clear as you can get it. Bringing the word `purpose' into this area would simply open up new uncertainties, if that is what people are thinking about doing. Senator Herron and others have spoken. I hope that my clarification will be seen by Senator Brown as responding to his question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Legislation that does not make it clear what it intends is bad legislation. Mr Dabb has been quoted, but he made it clear in his evidence that there were significant potential problems for the law if this bill passed as is. There was a line of eminent legal opinion to say that the lack of definition of the terms in this legislation would create problematic uncertainty as to the legal situation in the territories surrounding end of life medical decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opinions included David Bennett QC; Rex Wild QC; Tom Pauling QC; Mr Gary Humphries, the ACT Attorney&hyphen;General; Dr Margaret Otlowski, senior lecturer in law at the University of Tasmania; and Miss Meg Wallace. The fact is that the bill, by failing to have definition, may very well cut across the Natural Death Act 1988 of the Northern Territory and the consent to medical treatment act of the ACT. It may invalidate these pieces of legislation because it does not define what intentional killing means.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to get that definition here. It is significant that the mover of this legislation in this place has failed to come forward with any clarification. There are other matters that I would put to Senator Herron, but I fear he is going to serially refuse to come up with any definition, any explanation, any justification or any clear response at all on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One matter is the problem of double effect. That is, if a doctor in palliative care is increasing the dose of medication that is required to allay a person's suffering, and knows that by increasing it further it will lead to the person's early death, what is the situation as far as that doctor is concerned?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to Senator Harradine's contribution and am grateful to him for reminding us of the contribution that Mr Dabb made before the Senate committee when he gave evidence. I listened to it at the time and thought there was something strange about it. I am still uncertain in my mind, and now direct my question specifically to the minister. It is my understanding that the Acts Interpretation Act is the act that gives the power to refer to the second reading speech. It gives a power, as I understand it&mdash;I may be wrong; I am asking a genuine question here&mdash;to refer to the minister's second reading speech, not the speeches of the 30, 40 or 50 backbenchers speaking in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully you can come up with an answer to this one. If there is no interpretation contained within the act, do the courts, when challenged for an interpretation on the meaning of the law, then refer to the minister's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2314"> second reading speech or do they refer to all the second reading speeches? And, in referring to all the second reading speeches, do they then take account of who mentioned intentional killing in this instance, and do they count the numbers on that?

I want to make it clear that on Friday morning I predicted that we would get to the situation before very long where there would be people complaining about a proper debate on this matter tonight. I am not going to hold this committee up, but there are some matters of very great importance about the impact of this law on the Australian people.

You will be aware that the legal position of nurses is different from that of doctors in this situation, given that Australian law does not view them as merely an agent or instrument for implementing doctors' orders.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just make a couple of comments in respect of the issue of the meaning or the definition of the term `intentional killing'. Firstly, I do agree with the remarks of Senator Harradine, and certainly he speaks for those people who have voted in favour of the Euthanasia Laws Bill when he says that it is clearly intended that the words have their narrow meaning. Some people thought it was a rather jocular comment that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we could talk about narrow meanings and wide meanings, but people who have some knowledge of the law know that they are terms that clearly have a meaning in terms of statutory interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is this: we have got to look at this legislation before the Senate and how it relates to the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, and how the Northern Territory legislation relates to the criminal code. The position is that the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act created an exemption&mdash;as it were, created a defence&mdash;to what would otherwise have been&mdash;provided it was proved, of course, in a court of law&mdash;a criminal offence, that is, the criminal offence of intentional killing pursuant to the relevant crimes act or criminal code. That is the same throughout the rest of the country, if you look at any crimes act in the states. The term `intentional killing' has been defined over years and years of operation of the common law, as well as through the application of specific statutes such as the Crimes Act or criminal codes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terminology `intentional killing' has a clearly understood meaning with respect to the operation of the Crimes Act. What the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act did was to create this defence to what would otherwise, as I said, have been the application of the Crimes Act and potentially prosecution and conviction for murder or intentional killing. The defence was that available under the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, the defence of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that the bill that is before the Senate and has been voted on and supported removes the operation of that defence. It removes the existence of an exemption to the criminal law that was created in the first place by the Northern Territory. So the end result&mdash;excuse the pun, but there have been a few of those here tonight&mdash;is that you go back to the application of the Northern Territory criminal law. That is a position that is consistent with what will exist in the rest of the country. On that basis, we can sit here all night and Senator Brown and Senator McKiernan can stand up and ask questions of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2315"> senators about what is the meaning of `intentional killing'. If you want to do that, you may as well go ahead and debate what is the meaning of `intentional killing' pursuant to the Crimes Act. And that is clear&mdash;crystal clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make this further point: at the end of the day the issue arises&mdash;and can arise&mdash;only if somebody is prosecuted pursuant to the Crimes Act, the criminal code of the Northern Territory, and they raise the defence of euthanasia, which would no longer be available to them because that act would be overridden. However, the criminal law will still continue to operate and whether or not they would ever be convicted would depend on all of the issues that would be raised in any criminal prosecution for murder, manslaughter or whatever; that is, it would depend upon the facts of the case, upon the intention of the person who committed the act and upon all of the other issues. I have tried to at least clarify that issue, and I do not think the question needs to be asked again.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a bit of a concern here as well and it arises from the fact that we do have uncertainty in the legislation. Also, we do not have any clarification by the sponsor of the bill as to where that uncertainty should go. I think Senator McKiernan touched upon a very critical point when he referred to the Acts Interpretation Act. That point essentially was that, where you do not have clarity and you do have uncertainty and vagueness in legislation, then under the law of this country the courts look to second reading speeches, to the words of the sponsor, I suppose, of the legislation&mdash;the minister in most cases, and of course to the private member, who has initiated the legislation&mdash;to get some clarification of what is intended. They look to the second reading speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how often in the committee stage do we ask ministers to clarify what particular words in legislation mean? How often do we go away satisfied with the undertakings that ministers give us as to what the government's interpretation of such words amount to? It happens every day here. That is the practice of the place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately in this case we do not have Senator Herron telling us what his view of the legislation is and what is the sponsor's view of the words in doubt. That is an important gap and one we should focus on for a little while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have it here for two reasons. You do not have it here because Senator Herron has basically tossed this bill into the parliament and has gone walkabout.

If the answer is that the proposer of the bill or the draftsperson does not really think they can do much better than this, then maybe they stop at a point where there is a certain amount of uncertainty, and it is a matter for people who consider the bill whether they are prepared to pass the bill on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The common law has, over a period of years, distilled the question of what is unlawful 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2317"> killing and what might constitute intentional killing. The majority of the committee, at the conclusion of this report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, preferred the view as expressed by Mr Santamaria QC and Mr Hughes QC that the phrase `intentional killing' was of the narrow meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate that that is what is intended here. I put it to the Senate that a court would have great difficulty getting much assistance from this committee stage in that it is a conscience vote and in that Senator Herron is not the original mover of this bill&mdash;it is a private member's bill. Normally when a court looks at legislation and what is intended, it goes to the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. In this case, the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum are relying on established principles of law&mdash;principles of law that were described by gentlemen such as Messrs Hughes and Santamaria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just depends on whether or not you disagree with that, but I put it to you that the fact is that the proponents of this bill are accepting the advice of Messrs Santamaria and Hughes that the narrow meaning is intended and that the narrow meaning does apply. For the record, I reject the legal evidence as to the broader interpretation of `intentional killing'. I think that answers your question. If you persist in inquiring any further, then I would say to you that you can only go back to the committee report and read it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple, common question I want to put to the minister who has the carriage of this bill, and it is not a legal question, is this: as the person who has got the carriage of this bill, rightly or wrongly, through this Senate, will you go on the public record and say&mdash;on behalf of those votes that you lead here in this debate, and you do; they clearly constitute a majority here tonight&mdash;that it is not the intent of the bill, that it is not the intention of the supporters of this legislation in the Senate, for `intentional killing' to be interpreted in the broadest interpretation? Will you say that it is not the intention of the bill to interfere with the right to die laws? That is, as you know, Minister, the right of territorians to simply ask for extraordinary measures to be removed in order to sustain life.</PARA>

The question I ask is: do they go back to the minister's second reading speech?</PARA>

With respect to my colleague Senator Collins's comments, like the Northern Territory's Natural Death Act 1988, the ACT's Medical Treatment Act 1994, permitting doctors to withdraw treatment in some circumstances, is affected by the ambiguity of this particular interpretation. On behalf of the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth once again looking at this fundamental issue. I know that Senator Ellison has tried to answer it, but the committee, I think, made it clear in 4.7 of its report. It is worth stating on the record in this committee stage:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, the issue was whether "intentional killing" includes cases where a doctor takes action with the best of intentions (to avoid futile treatment or to optimise pain relief) but knows that the action will cause (or accelerate) the death of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are specifically looking at the application of this legislation on the Northern Territory's Natural Death Act 1988 and the ACT's Medical Treatment Act of 1988&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LUNDY" NAMEID="7G6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator Lundy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's 1994.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 1988 in this report&mdash;both of which permit doctors to withdraw treatment in some circumstances even though the doctor knows that death will result. The report goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Medical Treatment Act creates a right for patients to receive relief from pain and suffering to the maximum extent reasonable under the circumstances. This may include cases where the drugs given for pain relief may also hasten death.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the nub of the issue that we are concerned about. We are concerned about what the ACT government said when it gave evidence to the committee. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the legislation is sufficiently ambiguous as to create uncertainty about the operation of our Medical Treatment Act in the ACT. That is an act designed to reinforce the protocols of the palliative care practices in the territory. Doctors and nurses involved in this area would undoubtedly be uncertain about the application of the law as a result of this legislation and would be, I think, much more likely to be involved in litigation of some sort as a result of the passing of this federal act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you have got the ACT government saying very clearly that it is concerned about the impact of the broader definition on their Medical Treatment Act. The Northern Terri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2322"> tory government's submission had four Queen's Counsel confirming the same sort of concern. Its submission noted that expert views differed in respect of the provisions of the territory's Natural Death Act, but it had four QCs also expressing concern about the broader definition of `intentional killing' in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told to look at the advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. It is important to do that and it is quite illustrative to do that. For instance, there is uncertainty as to which criminal law would apply even if criminal law were to apply in interpreting the word `intentional' in this Andrews' bill. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department noted that the bill is a part of constitutive law not criminal statute so there is no presumption that `intentional' should be interpreted narrowly. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department distinguishes the Andrews' law because it is more constitutional law than criminal law. Its view is that there is no presumption that `intentional' should be interpreted narrowly. That is when the warning bells should start to ring. The committee goes on to say that the next question is, even if you were to look at criminal law, which jurisdiction's law of homicide would apply? Mr Dabb says once again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the only fair answer is that it is uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So uncertainty compounding uncertainty. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I would think the mere fact that the law of homicide varies considerably as between the jurisdictions concerned is a reasonably strong argument against saying that you simply go to what it means in the law of homicide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he says go back to the constitutive law, and basically makes it clear that, under constitutive law, you are looking at a broad interpretation of `intentional'. If you have got that broad interpretation of `intentional', that is where the Northern Territory's legislation and the ACT's legislation have got problems.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of possible differences between the law on "intentional killing" in the different jurisdictions largely reflects the fact that the law in all Australian jurisdictions is uncertain in the context of end-of-life medical decision-making.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you look at all of it. If you were to look at all of it, Senator Harradine, you would find that there is a real cause for concern here as to the uncertainty of this legislation&mdash;not just the actual interpretation of the words but even what area of law they should be interpreted under.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on here, but I think I will leave it at this particular stage. There is a concern and the concern is further expressed in 4.23 of the report, which states that the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department also raised further 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2323"> concerns as to what factors are taken into account if one were to look at the intention of the person who is in charge of the process. As I said earlier on, there was discussion about whether it should be sole purpose, main purpose or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really have a responsibility here to ensure that the words are right. If you were to look at the concerns expressed in the report, the advice of three Attorney-General's departments, you have to say that there is a real concern about the uncertainty in this legislation. It will not be good enough some months down the track when some poor doctor or nurse may be stung by the indirect consequences of this legislation to say, `Senator Herron did not give us any clarification. Okay, we had the advice of the AG's Department and that basically led us to believe it was uncertain, but we closed our eyes to all these concerns and moved on in our haste to get the legislation through.' That will not be a good enough defence for any innocent nurse or doctor who is caught by this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to say something about this. The question is whether or not this is as clear as it could be. The very presence of courts in the land and the presence of the legal profession, which so beautifully serves those courts, show that, clearly when laws are made, there is apt to be discussions about them. There are a couple of points I want to make. Senator Alston was taken to task, but the point he made that it is for the courts to interpret the laws is absolutely correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second proposition I want to put is that the concept of intent is a concept that is very familiar to the courts, whether it is an intention to kill, an intention to steal or an intention to do grievous bodily harm. That concept of intent is very familiar to the courts. The language that is used, whether or not it will be subject to interpretation later, is language that the courts are familiar with. Therefore, it is probably the best language that can be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to whether or not a narrow or a broad meaning ought to be taken in so far as the criminal law is concerned&mdash;and I have heard the argument that Senator Bolkus has put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about this also being a constitutional issue&mdash;it is a well worn phrase that the narrow interpretation must be taken where a criminal offence is involved. If a criminal offence is going to arise under this bill, in respect of that criminal offence it is the narrow meaning that must be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are getting ourselves a bit disturbed here. The terms of this legislation are terms that the courts will be familiar with. I cannot see their having any occasion to go to a second reading speech. If they do, there is no speech that they can really go to because all that people will be doing is expressing their own private opinions. The point of reading a minister's second reading speech is to see what the government that sponsored the legislation thought about it; what cabinet wanted to do. That is why you would go to the second reading speech. It is not so much the minister's second reading speech but the thinking of the government of the day whose legislation it is about which you want to find out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have threatened to debate this bill all night. So be it. We can debate it all night but in the end, with great respect to you, Senator Herron, whatever you say, whatever Senator Brownhill says, whatever Senator Campbell says&mdash;and no doubt he would prefer to be watching the cricket&mdash;it will be absolutely irrelevant to the court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments. I took a point of order earlier which I accept was taken at the wrong time. I think my colleague Senator Bolkus misinterpreted what I said in respect of the meaning of intentional killing so far as it existed as an offence under criminal law. It is pretty well settled as to what that means and how the Crimes Act is interpreted. As to whether or not an offence is committed, that is another matter altogether. That is a matter for a court to decide having regard to the facts and the operation of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2324">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment on the arguments put about whether or not the Euthanasia Laws Bill would override or place at risk the operation of other legislation in territories, such as the Natural Death Act. I do not think it would. I have read the report, and I have read the evidence before the committee on this issue. I appreciate that people have suggested that there could be some questions about this issue. I believe that there is no real question about that when the legislation is considered properly and interpreted properly&mdash;that is, that intentional killing does have the narrow meaning as would be understood under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the specific purpose and the only purpose of the so&hyphen;called Andrews bill is to enact legislation which overrides the operation of the Northern Territory legislation and thereby returns the situation to what was the position prior to the enactment of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. If you want any further support for that, you would go to the legislation: that is, the Euthanasia Laws Bill. You would look at clause 50A(2) of the bill, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislative Assembly does have power to make laws with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient, but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the appointment of an agent by a patient who is authorised to make decisions about the withdrawal or withholding of treatment; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the repealing of legal sanctions against attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact that those provisions are in the bill is a very clear signal as to the intention of this bill. The intention of this bill is not to interfere in any way with the right of the territory to pass laws such as the Natural Death Act, which, for instance, would legitimise an action which involved the withdrawal or withholding of medical treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a simple matter of statutory interpretation in accordance with the normal rules of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statutory interpretation. I believe that some questions being raised here tonight and some arguments being advanced are nice esoteric debating points&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not actually agree with that interpretation. I believe that the debate on this issue affects every state in the country. As I argued in my speech at the second reading stage, the support brought forward by many people for the Northern Territory legislation related to what they claimed was a fundamental individual right that all humans had: a right to end their own life or to have assistance to do that. In the broader context, I think the issue goes beyond the Northern Territory, but I do concede that we are only dealing with the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation does make it clear that it is not intended to override any of those specific laws, such as the Natural Death Act. I make this final point: if there is a challenge to this legislation, the court will decide that issue, just as it has decided on many occasions cases where challenges have been made by states, individuals or corporations to the operation of Commonwealth law as it interacts with state or territory law.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To expedite things, I would like to make my comments now so that if, or when, Senator Herron rises to make some response to the points made, he might also take up the point that I want to make. Although it is slightly aside from the one that is being debated here, it is something I want to hear his comment on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three words that really have been associated with this bill have been intention, intent and tolerance. I certainly have appreciated the tolerance with which senators have been able to put their point of view in this place and accept a wide range of debating 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2325"> points or arguments as people arrived at their conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points that I particularly wanted to pick up on is the one that Senator Herron made in his opening speech, which was understood by a lot of people to be the carriage of the bill in this place. I deliberated about whether or not to say this, and now I have decided that I will. Senator Herron, you made reference to doctors who would be participating in these kinds of practices as being related very closely to doctors who practised the same sorts of things in Nazi Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I want to say that I personally, and on behalf of thousands of citizens, take considerable offence at any kind of reference that anybody deliberating in this place on how best to deal with this matter should in any way be associated with the practices of doctors, let alone anybody else in Nazi Germany. It is a most surprising comment from you, Senator Herron. You are not known to me as a person of that kind of intolerance or smear comment. I would like you to have the opportunity to apologise or make clear what you intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that the matters here are matters of  greatest importance. They are matters of fine line and hair&hyphen;splitting interpretation. If you have ever&mdash;and I suspect you might have, as I have&mdash;had to watch as you accept the decision to turn off the blood transfusion, which has no effect other than killing a person or bringing to an end the life of that person, how can you be clear that that is an accepted, justifiable and legal thing to do, as was part of what the Northern Territory was allowing to happen in its territory under its legislation? That is a very fine line. A lot of it has gone to the intent and what might happen if that intent ran amuck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it has been a very useful discussion in the committee stage of this bill to get clear what is meant by another use of intent, as in intentional killing. Intent has a variety of meanings in this debate. I hope that the intent of all of us in this debate is taken to be an intention of goodwill and serious deliberations on matters of great importance and that we are accepted in our different points of view 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with considerable tolerance, though some of us are finding it a little harder rather than easier this evening because none of us are other than passionate about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that that tolerance also extends outside this parliament to everybody in the community. But I would have to say, as I said in my speech on the second reading, that the community is way ahead of its parliamentarians in matters of law. I think they are also largely way ahead of us in matters of tolerance.</PARA></SPEECH>

I stand not as a minister but as a person with carriage of the bill, very willingly. I was very proud to have the carriage of this bill in the Senate. I do not resile from that. But I should explain to Senator Crowley that my reference to the very specific matter that she referred to was made because people can believe that they have higher motives in pursuing something that is to the detriment of the population as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going to end the committee stage of this bill without defining `intentional killing'. It is not defined in the jurisdictions of either the ACT or the Northern Territory, as Senator Herron has just said. It ought to be defined in this legislation because it specifically applies to those jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, there are as many definitions as there are senators. At least one senator who voted for this legislation has said that, to him, the other definitions do not apply. There is no way that anybody reading the proceedings of this committee can determine what was thought by the majority or minority. References to officer Dabb of the Attorney-General's Department are just that; they are selective from both sides of the committee. He even referred to extremely broad meanings of the term `intentional killing'. There is no limit to the breadth or narrowness of this definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appearing before the committee were other eminent legal people who gave different definitions and expressed other concerns. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any case, the proceedings of the committee are not of themselves a definition under this law, nor are they binding on this Senate committee. So there is no direction as to what such terms as `mercy killing', `intentional killing' and `euthanasia' mean under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent upon those who draw up such legislation to make such matters clear. But from the debate we have heard in this committee there can be no clarification, there is no definition. There is no way that a court, from the proceedings of this committee, can determine what was meant by the committee, by the Senate, in terms of definition of those words. The problem here comes at the outset from those who drafted the law and brought it before this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron's responsibilities are no more or less than those of a minister at the table, hosting this legislation. The standing orders of the Senate do not define that there should be a minister there at any time; they simply talk about the committee as a whole looking at the question that has been put to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a complete failure on the matter of these critical definitions. It does leave the law under great question in the jurisdictions of both the ACT and the Northern Territory and there is no way, from the debate we have heard tonight, of fixing that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with some interest during the committee stage to the debate on the Acts Interpretation Act and what regard judges could pay to the debate in terms of any concern they had afterwards about the meaning of the bill. My recollection of that act&mdash;I could be wrong, because I am not a lawyer&mdash;is that it does not simply apply to the mover of the bill, a minister as it normally is: the courts can have regard to the whole debate. I am pleased indeed that it is not simply the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, in concluding the debate on this bill, I want to remind all honourable senators of the words with which this debate was started by the mover of the bill. I want to ask honourable senators who disagree with me to at least understand the position of people like me from the Northern Territory who do not support euthanasia. The reason I make that statement is&mdash;I recall this for honourable senators, because it may not have had this impact on you as you do not come from the Northern Territory&mdash;that these were almost the very opening words in the first paragraph or two that were uttered in the House of Representatives by Kevin Andrews in moving the bill. Mr Andrews said, `Territorians have no rights, only obligations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to tell you that, as I actually served 10 years of my political career in the Northern Territory's parliament, it has been a matter of great anger for me to listen, not the views of people who disagree with me on euthanasia&mdash;because I do understand the arguments on all sides&mdash;but to the vilification that I have heard from many members and senators about the Northern Territory and its parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred to Senator Abetz earlier&mdash;and I do not need to look it up in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; it is all burnt on my brain. He said, `The Northern Territory parliament exists only by the grace and favour of the Commonwealth parliament. What the Commonwealth parliament gives, it can also take away.' This is from a senator from a state with about twice the population of the Northern Territory's, and five times its representation in the House of Representatives and six times its representation here in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2328"> Senate. When is that important? On conscience votes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. He is a senator, of course, who violently objected to the federal parliament's vote in respect of privacy laws that struck down anti-homosexual laws in Tasmania. I have found states rights to be a very convenient argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who served in that parliament for a decade, it is with some degree of anger that I have listened to those totally dismissive and contemptible comments, not about euthanasia but about the Territory's legislature. The reason is this: from my experience of a decade in the Territory's parliament, and from my experience of 10 years in this parliament, and from my considerable experience with the members of parliaments from other states around Australia, the facts are that the Territory parliament has no more dills, idiots or cowboys proportionally than any other parliament in Australia. It has just as many members of parliament who actually concern themselves about legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference is&mdash;and I concede it&mdash;its small size. It is much smaller than any other parliament. Therefore, I guess to that extent it is concentrated. But the reason I make that point is this: I have heard again and again in here&mdash;Senator Calvert from Tasmania, you and your 11 colleagues in here&mdash;about the fact that, `Isn't it shocking that this vote was cast by a handful of votes in the Northern Territory?' That is a bit cute coming from a senator. There are 76 senators in here. We know that because of the balance of power on major issues affecting a lot of Australians&mdash;not me, I might add&mdash;as strongly as euthanasia, despite our 76 votes in here the Telstra issue was decided on two votes. One is Senator Harradine and the other is Senator Colston. Two votes determined that issue in here. Does that mean that that legislation has no validity and it should be struck down because it was passed by a handful of votes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland parliament is currently having its legislation determined on a daily basis by one vote, as it happens, despite all of its numbers. Does that mean that that legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion, therefore, has no validity? I must say that these two votes are the main reason I rise tonight. But there are major issues like Telstra. Who can ever forget&mdash;I will never forget&mdash;in that debate the sight of the minister for Telstra leading Senator Colston by the elbow, physically, across the floor of this Senate chamber to make sure that he voted the right way when he had forgotten that he was on the wrong side?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like, for everyone's sake, is for the government to expedite the passage of this legislation. Is it the case that it will have to go back to the House of Representatives because of the amendment that was passed at the second reading stage? I am advised by the clerk that it does not. I thank him for his confirmation of that fact. I hope, therefore, that they get it to the Governor-General tomorrow so that certainty will be placed in this debate&mdash;even though it is the wrong way as far as I am concerned. At least there will not be a period of weeks, which normally happens, until the next Executive Council meeting, where people may want to avail themselves of this Northern Territory law in some interregnum period. Frankly, I think that would be a tragedy for both sides of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to conclude as I started. I take enormous offence, as a Territorian, about having this bill brought into this parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning we are closing a chapter of the debate. We are closing a chapter of the debate because the legislation we are overruling by the passage of this legislation is a territory legislation. I have hopes, and, indeed, I am encouraged in certain quarters, that some of our states will enact legislation similar to, maybe even better than, what is now in existence in the Northern Territory to give individual human beings some control over their lives and their deaths.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very strong and powerful debate in this parliament. In the House of Representatives, the vote was 88 to 35. In this Senate, the margin is very close, and we have yet to see the vote on the third reading of the Euthanasia Laws Bill. I think I can safely predict that the issue that has been raised and addressed by this parliament will continue to be a moral issue for the future, especially when the states, as they almost certainly will and should, introduce their own legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation ought to have been properly debated, sponsored and conducted in the state parliaments of Australia. The fact that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2330"> Northern Territory parliament, also when it first addressed this legislation at the second reading stage, voted 13 votes to 12 and subsequently, at the third reading of that bill in the Northern Territory, voted 15 to 10 shows the very special consideration that this legislation was given by a group of very representative, democratically elected territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With no disrespect to the special committee of this Senate, which I consider has done a very good job in the time constraints it worked under, the Northern Territory select committee was much more comprehensive both in time and in scope and in consultation with the affected communities. In that regard it was very special.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the dilemma experienced by many of my colleagues in this chamber from the deep&hyphen;seated opposition on the moral and social implications of voluntary euthanasia. As I said at the outset, it is timely that that debate continue to be canvassed because over 70 per cent of Australians are very clearly clamouring for this type of legislation to be properly initiated and properly considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Bob Collins, I share the concerns that territory rights for the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island have been trampled on by the process of this legislation, both in the House of Representatives and here. I acknowledge and thank the number of senators who have obviously shifted ground in the course of this debate to more properly reflect the views that are taken in the community. The fact that it was two to one&mdash;88 to 35&mdash;in the House of Representatives, and our vote earlier this evening on the second reading was 38 to 34, shows the extreme movement that took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of this place are no different on moral issues from our colleagues in the House of Representatives. There were manipulative forces that played a role in marginal seats in the House of Representatives, and far too many of our colleagues sycophantically played follow the leader. That is something that we need to look at very carefully in our considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a very strong and active campaign right throughout the community. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This is an appropriate piece of legislation for proper consideration. As I have said, I believe that in the future the leadership will now fall on the states. Once it is in place in one of the states, and this Senate has no power to override that state, then it will again be a time for a territory, hopefully the Northern Territory, to get to that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would challenge the Senate to look very carefully at the other issues that were at stake in this debate, particularly statehood and self-government for the Northern Territory. The Senate and the House of Representatives will need to restore the confidence of territorians that the rhetoric that has been offered by so many of our colleagues in the last decade is in fact properly reinforced and underpinned for self-government. Similarly, we will have to address very seriously in the near future the outcomes of the issues relating to Wik and native title, and, in the Northern Territory's case, perhaps amendments to the Aboriginal land rights legislation of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have exciting challenges in front of us with regard to these goals, whether they be native title, whether they be Commonwealth funding for the territories and, in the long term, securing territory by the turn of the century. I would hope that those results will be evident in this Senate in the very near future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to add my comments with respect to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. They, too, are directly affected by the passage of this Euthanasia Laws Bill. At the moment, there are amendments before the assembly that were deferred until later this year to allow this debate to take place. That debate will now not occur in the ACT assembly as a result of the passage of this bill. So, like the Northern Territory, the passage of this bill will directly impinge upon our ability as territorians to make laws with regard to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ambiguity of the definition of intentional killing has not yet been resolved. We have seen from the evidence put before us that that will be subject to legal challenge. The ACT 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2331"> government and representatives thereof have stated their intention to proceed with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Tambling when he says that this is not where the debate ends; it just enters a different phase. The people of the ACT have clearly stated their intention as to which path they intend to proceed along, and their elected representatives in the assembly of the Australian Capital Territory will no doubt proceed with their own views on this matter. While this bill is on the books, it is impinging directly upon the rights of the people of the ACT and their elected representatives to pursue a legislative course that they deem fit and appropriate for the people that they represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Statehood is not the answer for the Australian Capital Territory; we cannot even look forward to that as a way of excluding ourselves from the imposition of the Andrews bill. The only solution for the people of the ACT is the removal&mdash;the repeal&mdash;of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to everyone who supported the Andrews bill: you have knowingly influenced and impacted upon the ability of the people of the ACT to make laws in this regard. The people of the ACT have quite clearly stated their intent in this matter. Regardless of what the outcome may have been in the ACT Assembly with respect to the proposed amendments to the Medical Treatment Act 1994, they will now not have the choice or the option of even debating them in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view it is a very sad day for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I concur completely with the comments made by my colleague Senator Bob Collins when he said that this law is discriminatory against the people of the territories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is it a fact that the Pacific Teal's only previous Pacific voyage carrying toxic nuclear materials ended in near engine failure with all 4 cylinders cracked and the real threat of a maritime calamity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Why does the Government rest easy with the fact that the Pacific Teal's cargo does not have liability cover, even though a major accident would need a multi&hyphen;billion dollar salvage and clean up effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) What is the exact route to be taken by the Pacific Teal in the Southern and South Pacific Oceans; if the exact route is not known, why not.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2333" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question. Due to the nature of the question, information had to be sought from our missions in London and Paris, resulting in an unavoidable delay in providing the answer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government has been advised by British Nuclear Fuels Limited that during a voyage from Europe to Japan and back completed in 1990, there was a slight loss of coolant in one of the two engines of the Pacific Teal. The post&hyphen;voyage inspection identified hairline cracks in the cylinder blocks. These had not interrupted the completed voyage or affected the ship's safe performance. The damaged cylinder blocks of both engines were immediately replaced by new cylinder blocks of a different design.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The high&hyphen;level radioactive waste being carried by the Pacific Teal is in a vitrified form, which has a low solubility in water. An environmental impact assessment performed at the request of the Science and Technology Agency in Japan prior to the 1995 high&hyphen;level waste shipment, which adopted the extreme scenario that a high&hyphen;level waste package sank, vitrified wastes were exposed to seawater and radionuclides leached into the sea, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> found that the dose equivalent of radiation exposure to the public would be much lower than the dose limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiolological Protection. The Government has been advised that in case of an emergency, the shippers have well&hyphen;developed emergency response arrangements and comprehensive salvage plans, including a team of experts on 24&hyphen;hour standby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless the Government does not "rest easy" over liability arrangements such as those covering the Pacific Teal. Australia has been participating actively in international negotiations since 1990 in the International Atomic Energy Agency Standing Committee on Nuclear Liability, for the establishment of a world&hyphen;wide liability regime to supplement and enhance the measures in the Paris, Vienna and Brussels Conventions (to which Australia is not party). By increasing compensation for transboundary harm, and providing compensation for environmental damage, such an international regime will enhance existing measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the unlikely event that an accident involving the Pacific Teal did occur resulting in the release of radioactivity and causing economic damage, Australian interests affected would have several options for seeking compensation. Japanese and French authorities have advised the Government that there is liability coverage on the shipment, under an agreement between the French reprocessing company Cogema, and the Japanese Government. However, the Australian Government has not been provided with any detailed information on the content of that agreement, and is continuing to press the Japanese and French authorities on the issue. Depending on the applicability of this agreement, Australian interests affected by an accident could also seek recourse to remedies through private international law. Failing this, once all such remedies have been exhausted, Australia could also seek to bring an action on behalf of the affected parties in the International Court of Justice, under customary international law. In order to bring such an action, all parties would have to agree to the Court hearing the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The general route taken by the Pacific Teal in its voyage from France to Japan was via the Cape of Good Hope, south of Australia, through the Tasman Sea and into the Southwest Pacific. The exact route was determined by the ship's captain, who regularly advised our maritime authorities of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2334"> his position when the ship was in the Australian search and rescue area.</PARA>

In May 1993, the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Minister for Science and Small Business established the Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WISET) Advisory Group to advise on strategies to improve women's participation in science, engineering and technology careers and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The WISET Advisory Group prepared a discussion paper, Women in Science, Engineering and Technology, which was published in May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The previous Government did not respond to the WISET paper before the change of Government. While this Government recognises that the WISET paper has provided a valuable analysis of issues facing women in science, engineering and technology (SET), the paper's recommendations are more relevant to the outlook of the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, this Government will not prepare a written response to the detailed recommendations of the WISET paper. Our approach to improving the participation of women in SET&hyphen;based careers and education is to create a broad, positive environment in which all Australians have the maximum opportunity to achieve their potential. We do this against the background that the numbers of women undertaking education and careers in science, engineering and technology is increasing, although there is still some way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to our broad, positive policies and programs in employment, higher education, vocational education and training, primary and secondary education and communications, we will continue our efforts to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and reporting on ministerial and departmental accountability for the impact of programs on women clients, including the existing range of programs to achieve gender equity in SET educational and employment contexts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue our efforts to include women equitably in the educational and employment contexts of SET through programs in all relevant agencies. These include, for example, a new system of merit&hyphen;based scholarships to assist members of equity target groups, including women in non&hyphen;traditional areas of study, to participate in higher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education, and the introduction of part&hyphen;time traineeships and other flexible arrangements provided in the new apprenticeship scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to support for a reconstituted science, engineering and technology awareness program which has women and girls among its targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to ensuring that women make a substantial contribution to, and gain the benefits from, participation in science, engineering and technology education, training and employment, including at the most senior levels of management, in both the public and private sectors.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) How many applications have been lodged to obtain patents for gene(s) or gene sequences with: (a) unknown function as a component part of a claim; and (b) known function as a component part of a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) How many patents have been granted for gene(s) or gene sequences with: (a) unknown function as a component part of a claim; and (b) known function as a component part of a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) How many applications has the Patent Office refused for gene(s) or gene sequences with:<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS> (a) unknown function; and (b) known function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Would the Patent Office grant patents for an identical sequence of bases (A, T, G and C) obtained from different organisms; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Would the Patent Office grant patents for a short sequence of bases within the immediate regulatory region 5' of a start codon where: (a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the sequence has been shown to have regulatory action; (b) the sequence is presumed to have regulatory significance; and (c) the sequence has no regulatory significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) What does the Patent Office define as a `gene'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) At what stage does a gene or a gene sequence from a human cease to be human so that it can be patented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) With reference to subsection 18(2) of the Patents Act 1990, which provides that `Human beings, and the biological processes for their

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Patent Office estimates that a total of around 8,100 patent applications concerning genes or gene sequences have been made. Data on the individual claims of these applications are not collected. However, it should be noted that the Patent Office does not grant patents for genes and gene sequences where no use is known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Patent Office estimates that a total of around 2,100 patent applications concerning genes or gene sequences have been granted. Data on the individual claims of these applications are not collected. However, it should be noted again that the Patent Office does not grant patents for genes and gene sequences where no use is known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Patent Office does not collate the data to answer this question beyond that provided to question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Patent Office does not collate the data to answer this question beyond that provided to question 2.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2343"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) As stated in answer to questions 1 and 2 above, an estimated 8,100 patent applications concerning genes or gene sequences have been made with a total of approximately 2,100 having been granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Patent Office would most likely consider that the gene was already known and therefore not novel and not patentable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (a) Yes, provided all the usual criteria for patentability (ie. novelty, inventive step and, in particular, industrial use) have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes, provided all the usual criteria for patentability (ie. novelty, inventive step and, in particular, industrial use) have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No, unless the applicant can show some other industrial use for the particular sequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The Patent Office uses the normal scientific definition for a gene, which can be found in many biological dictionaries e.g. Henderson's Biological Dictionary defines a gene as `the basic unit of inheritance, by which hereditary characteristics are transmitted from parent to offspring'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) An isolated single gene or gene sequence from a human is not considered a human. Provided a human gene or gene sequence meets the usual criteria as stated in the Patents Act 1990, it is patentable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The Patent Office estimates that since 1975, about 1.8% of patent applications filed in Australia have concerned genes or gene sequences.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
