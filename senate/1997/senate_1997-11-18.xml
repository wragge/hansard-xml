<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin. Minister, why has the government repeatedly refused to release its legal advice on whether the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is consistent with Australia's international legal obligations and whether it overrides the Racial Discrimination Act? When was the government advice sought; who provided it; and when was it received? Will the government now release the advice and, if not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8949" SPEAKER="Minchin, Sen Nick" NAMEID="JX4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bolkus for his question. Naturally, there have been discussions within the government on legal aspects of this bill, as there must be in developing a very complex piece of legislation. We have released our legal advice from the Solicitor&hyphen;General which confirmed that the legislation is constitutional, that it is of net benefit to Aboriginal people, that it does not contravene the races power and is a legitimate exercise of the races power within the constitution, and is a bill of benefit to Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to speculate at this stage about what advice the government may or may not have received on a whole range of legal and policy issues involved in the development of this very significant, technical and complex legislation. It is the case that on many occasions the previous government declined to say whether it had legal advice on particular issues and what advice that was. That is the traditional position adopted by governments quite properly and one pursued by the previous government on numerous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to state that the Native Title Amendment Bill was drafted with very close regard for Australia's international human 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights obligations. We support the principles of non&hyphen;discrimination in both the Racial Discrimination Act and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note that the Native Title Act 1993 already validates past acts that might have been invalid due to the Racial Discrimination Act, and it allows for the extinguishment of native title by compulsory acquisition. The Native Title Amendment Bill adopts a very similar approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Amendment Bill will similarly allow for validation although on a much more restricted scale. It continues the existing compulsory acquisition arrangements in the current act. I have had the benefit of rereading all the debates and what went on in 1993 in relation to the Native Title Act. That Native Title Act was criticised repeatedly by Aborigines and others as being inconsistent with Australia's human rights obligations and with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What the former Labor government did, and what this parliament agreed to, in order to resolve those sorts of issues, was to ensure that the act contained a provision which established the relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act.

<PARA STYLE="Para">You all accepted that as the proper relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. Our bill maintains exactly that provision. Our bill continues the arrangements which you, the then Labor government, and this Senate regarded as an appropriate and acceptable statement of the relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. You ought to agree that that is the appropriate provision with which to continue in the Native Title Amendment Bill which we are proposing to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not racially discriminatory. It preserves and protects the common law right

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WP6">Senator LIGHTFOOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is very painful for the opposition, who opposed it, but I ask you to listen, please. You must be embarrassed, but I am going to ask the minister anyway. Minister, what is the government's position in relation to any further sale of Telstra after the next election?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8950" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that it was indeed an unprecedented success in the annals of Australian economic history. It delivered enormous benefits to all those who invested in it. It certainly delivers benefits to consumers. It means that, for the first time, in excess of 600,000 people are new shareholders and therefore have a direct stake in the Australian economy. Nearly 1.9 million people and institutions subscribed to shares in Telstra. As a result, taxpayers will benefit to the tune of $14 billion&hyphen;plus. In addition, Australians will have the benefit of the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust and those in regional and remote areas will benefit from the $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this could have occurred if we had not got this bill through, in the teeth of opposition from that crowd opposite who were not interested in the slightest, despite the fact they privatised everything in sight, in the merits of the argument; they were simply interested in doing what their masters told them&mdash;that is, to not, in any shape or form, weaken union power and allow any more privatisations through in opposition. Our position is perfectly clear. We made it plain before the last election that, if we were to seek a mandate for any further sale of Telstra, we would do that in the context of an election. That remains our commitment. We have made no decision whether or not to proceed to sell down any more of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is in stark contrast to the position of the opposition. It is critically important to understand this, because at the moment the Labor Party platform, which is to go forward to the national conference, merely talks about retaining Telstra in majority public ownership. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8951"> As Senator Ray told the Senate on 29 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the platform says is that we believe in majority ownership of Telstra, and that is exactly where we are at.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What he is at is having a lend of the likes of Senator Faulkner, who, presumably, if he still has any factional commitment to anything, would be in there arguing tooth and nail for no further sell down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray was prepared to give us a short lecture on the difference between platform and policy. I think we all understand what platforms are about. They are about stating where you stand in principle. We have no in principle objection to any further sell down. Does the Labor Party? The platform is the document in which to make that clear. If the Labor Party believe that simply selling down 51 per cent is okay by them, then you retain the wording of the platform as it currently is which says you simply believe in majority public ownership. I hope Senator George Campbell is taking great notice of this because that platform leaves it wide open to sell down another 16 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have Senator Ray telling the Senate that a future Labor government will not sell one share more in Telstra than has been sold off by this government, and Mr Beazley saying that they do not think this much of Telstra should have been sold and that there will certainly be no more sold, why wouldn't they be prepared to reflect that as the in principle position in their platform? All they need to say is that they do not believe in any further sell down and that they believe in the maximum possible public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is their position, let them say so. Otherwise, this dissembling makes Murray Farquhar look like a choirboy. The fact is that they are trying to have it both ways. They are trying to carry out the usual mass of deceits and distractions. They are simply not prepared to face up to the fact that this has been a huge success. The majority of the party do not like it, but of course the leaders are wanting to keep their options open. If that is the way it is, if that is the way you are going to have it, then we understand it. Your platform allows a further sell down and that is your formal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position. If it doesn't, then change it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from that obvious proposition&mdash;that the Labor Party wants to keep its options open and in the platform make it plain that it is prepared to sell down another 16 per cent if necessary&mdash;the only other alternative approach is that espoused by Senator Schacht who is still in the business of arguing that Telstra ought to be broken up, presumably along the Keating model lines of separating core and non&hyphen;core businesses. That is what you said in your press release when you endorsed the criticism made by the NCC. You said that there should have been an inquiry carried out before any privatisation was embarked on in order to establish whether there were core parts of the business that ought to be retained. You wanted an examination of whether or not it should be broken up into pieces. That is the alternative. If you get a guernsey at the national conference&mdash;it is not looking too good at the moment, but if you are even able to be there as an observer&mdash;presumably that is what you will be arguing for. You will have Senator Faulkner arguing for maximum possible public ownership and you will have Senator Ray arguing for a majority.

I am advised that the Attorney-General's Department contacted DFAT in March and advised that they did not know the whereabouts of Mr Dunn but heard that he might be in Honduras. I am further advised that former Ambassador Broinowski, who was accredited to Honduras, was asked that day to seek information regarding extradition and deportation procedures applicable in Honduras, in response to a request from the Attorney-General's Department, and that he followed up on the issue during a visit to Honduras shortly afterwards. I understand that he reported to DFAT by cable on 17 March 1997 of the situation. A copy of that cable was passed to the Attorney-General's Department, which, of course, has primary responsibility for extradition matters, and was taken into account.

Isn't it true that there are no obligations on any company to go beyond `no regrets' measures, and isn't it true that there is no obligation on any company to actually meet their stated reduction targets?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have got it closer to correct than usual, if I might say so, with respect, Senator. This is a voluntary program with Australian business and other organisations. It has now been extended to include local and state government organisations, industry groups, and some federal departments, I am pleased to say, including the department that is responsible for this building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept is that these organisations, within a `no regrets' envelope, will seek to do all that is reasonably possible to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. They are under an obligation to, firstly, prepare an inventory of their emissions to analyse what potential 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reductions can be made, and then to demonstrate to the Commonwealth government through the Greenhouse Challenge Office that they are in fact going to the barrier of `no regrets', that they are doing all that is possible to reduce their greenhouse emissions consistent with not undermining their economic credibility&mdash;in other words, `no regrets' being that you are seeking to achieve a better environmental outcome that is consistent with not a worse economic outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cooperative scheme has been incredibly successful, I might say, Madam President. As you would know, it has been taken up by other governments around the world. President Clinton announced the other day that he was setting up a similar scheme for the United States. In this country, agreements have now been reached with a hundred different companies and organisations, which is very pleasing. Each of those companies and organisations have entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth government consistent with the outline that I have just put to you. The result is a very substantial reduction of business as usual in terms of greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the contribution to the change of culture in relation to energy production is also very significant. What is particularly pleasing to us is the way that Australian companies are now almost competing with each other for the best environmental bottom lines. There are few better ways that I can think of to ultimately achieve a better greenhouse contribution as a nation as a whole than to have Australian corporates approaching the challenge in that light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, yes, Madam President, this is a voluntary scheme. It has now been going for a few years. It has been remarkably successful. We have a hundred companies and organisations committed. More are coming on line all the time. I simply take this opportunity to congratulate those companies and organisations that have participated with government in this way. I would also like to congratulate the Greenhouse Challenge Office and staff, who I think have done a remarkably good job. The contribution that Australian corporates are making through this scheme is something that

I agree that the Netherlands have got quite a good program. Those who study these things seem to refer to either the Australian program or the Netherlands program as leading the world. So, to the extent that you praise the Netherlands, I would like to think that you were also praising Australian corporates, but I suspect that would be too much to expect of the Australian Democrats.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator MacGibbon&mdash;a senator from the great state of Queensland&mdash;for his question. The Commonwealth does welcome the Queensland government's approval on 11 November of a mediated agreement recognising native title at Hopevale in Far North Queensland. This agreement brought together the state and local governments, native title parties&mdash;some 13 clans were involved&mdash;the commercial fishing industry, Telstra, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Far North Queensland Electricity Corporation, the Cape Flattery Silica Mines and the Cape York Land Council. The Queensland coalition government really should be congratulated on its work in reaching this agreement and its recognition of native title on the Hopevale deed of grant in trust land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement reflects the commitment of governments&mdash;both state and federal&mdash;indigenous parties and other interests to work constructively to resolve these native title claims. The application for native title will now be referred to the Federal Court for a consent order confirming this agreement. Once approved, it would be the first determination of native title in Queensland since the Mabo decision and only the second native title matter determined through the National Native Title Tribunal's mediation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may know that Hopevale is a former Lutheran mission approximately 200 kilometres north of Cairns, and it is home to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8960"> traditional Aboriginal owners and historical people whose traditional lands are elsewhere. It is a credit to the native title claimants and an indication of their goodwill that the rights of these historical people to traverse, hunt and fish in the land of the claimants have been guaranteed&mdash;one of the real issues that had to be resolved in getting this agreement sorted out. The Hopevale Aboriginal Council will retain local government functions and all relevant state and Commonwealth laws will continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successful resolution of this claim by agreement does not mean that the need to make the Native Title Act more workable has gone away. The two native title claims in this area were lodged back in 1994 and we have only now reached agreement on the claim to recognise the native title. In this case there was a very big head start. The Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen government itself had awarded inalienable freehold title to this land back in 1986. I think we should acknowledge what the former Queensland coalition government did in 1986 in recognising that freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delay in coming to agreement is no reflection on any of the parties involved in forming this agreement, but it is very clear evidence of the problems involved in working through the current Native Title Act. It is just such a difficult piece of legislation to work through. I must say that the Labor Party and the National Indigenous Working Group do recognise and accept that there is a very significant need to fix up the current act's inadequate voluntary agreements provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the current provisions do not guarantee legal certainty for agreements about native title. That is a fundamental deficiency in the act. So our bill is essential so that fair and legally certain negotiated agreements can be a real alternative to long, drawn out and adversarial legal cases. We would of course prefer resolution of native title issues by voluntary agreements to be the norm and not the exception. It is clear that strong, negotiated agreements are absolutely fundamental if you are going to have practical coexistence on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our encouragement for this approach is not just through rhetoric but through the bill's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very detailed and sensible framework for certain and fair voluntary agreements. Once these agreement provisions are in place, as I hope they will be when this Senate rises, there will be genuine incentive to follow the approach that was successful at Hopevale.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I was interviewed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> . It is a pity that a bit more of that does not get into the wider spectrum of newspapers rather than the attacks that occur constantly, particularly in some of the metropolitan press.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to reiterate that speech. In my speech at the time I said that this is a recipe for disaster. There were amendments being done in the corridors, as we could see advisers rushing in and rushing out of the adviser boxes. It was an absolute shambles. It was apparent even to me. I came into the chamber and I said at the time, `I know little about this. I have listened to the debate and it is obvious to me that this bill is going to be an absolute shambles.' That is what we inherited when we came into government. We were faced with trying to resolve the problems that had occurred as a result of that legislation that was passed by this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would recall too, Madam President, as I am sure everybody in the chambers would, the applause, the almost deification of Senator Evans, as he was then, for the great work that he had done&mdash;carried it entirely on his own. That result was produced and we are picking up the pieces now. We went to the last election saying that we would produce a resolution of this and that is what we are doing. It is a fair and equitable resolution of the problems that are affecting this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there are comments and I respect those statements. I have spoken to the chairman of ATSIC about it. Again, the dear old ABC sent a crew up there, edited what they thought was suitable for their purposes and then put it on television. I am surprised at Senator Bob Collins taking everything at face value. I always remember Malcolm Muggeridge said, `How can you disbelieve the evidence of your own eyes?' in  relation to editing of television programs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elderly are the main users and beneficiaries of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The Government overall, covers 80 per cent of the full cost of PBS medicines. The elderly are also the people who will benefit most if the Scheme is more cost effective and able to cover important new medicines as they emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is saying that where there are a number of choices, we will fund a set price for the alternatives. It is a choice for the doctor and patient to decide if they want to choose a more expensive version. Like brand premiums introduced by the opposition when in government, therapeutic premiums are an avoidable price signal. Where a doctor and patient do decide that a drug above the base should be used, the average premium is likely to be under $2.

The significance of this lies in the fact that it is the same group of companies that has access to infor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8965"> mation relating to the strategic development of that whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How IBM Global Services got this particular contract in the first place is another area of concern that has been well canvassed in this place, given that they did not even have to participate in a competitive tendering process. They were awarded the contract by the minister utilising a discretionary provision under the interim guidelines after an unsolicited approach, in the first instance, from IBM Global Services to the Department of Finance and Administration. Interestingly, the original contract that was piggybacked upon by IBM Global Services was awarded prior to this government's IT outsourcing program being implemented through the original PE68 IT panel. At the time, there was angst as to the loss of that contract from the original vendor, Ferntree, amidst public speculation that IBM came in below cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In retrospect, it is not difficult to speculate upon the value of that investment. IBM Global Services have since picked up $70 million worth of contract work in IT outsourcing without having to prepare one additional tender. What an investment! While the rest of the industry is now complaining quite vigorously about the magnitude and complexity of some 15 clusters that are now proposed under the government's IT outsourcing program, IBM has cruised through. Now we find that a partner, Computer Power, is also involved in the applications development work of that particular department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a critical issue in terms of due process and public accountability. In contrast, if there were to be in-house bids, the government would have made sure that there were strict competitive neutrality principles applying, but it seems that this was just too hard for the government to institute. I believe, at the behest of the larger corporations participating in this process, that the government excluded the opportunity for in-house bids in the IT outsourcing program. What we have now is no process to check the competitive neutrality of what is now occurring within the Department of Finance and Administration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was quick to crow about the Independent Probity Auditor that he announced to put in place some semblance of checks and balances on the IT outsourcing program, but we are yet to see any evidence that this Independent Probity Auditor has been able to apply any viewpoints or any critique upon the process. If that has occurred, that information has not been able made available to the parliament. Why is it that probity is not getting an airing in this area of IT outsourcing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have seen, through questions to the minister, some examples of specific issues that are worthy of scrutiny, that are worthy of some response from this government. It is not surprising that a perception is building that there is, at best, an uneven playing field and, at worst, a serious breach of due process and a blatant conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked for some answers on specific matters to clarify these critical questions of probity but, as yet, they have not been forthcoming. No contract has yet been awarded under the government's IT outsourcing program&mdash;they have only been given away to IBM-GSA&mdash;and neither should there be. It is a flawed process, and the recent Senate inquiry into this issue exposed the flaws in this government's IT outsourcing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program should be stopped at this point and a rethinking of the whole strategy should occur. The government should commit themselves to not doing any further piggybacking and bypassing of the competitive tendering process. The government should also get themselves a minister who can at least keep himself briefed on what is a critical issue of both public accountability for government administration and industry development.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The questioning by a number of opposition senators this afternoon really followed very closely a number of issues that were canvassed in a recent inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. That committee was chaired by Senator Murphy&mdash;a person who asked a number of questions. While we are on air I think it is useful to note that, in reading much of the metropolitan daily press, one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8966"> would have hardly been aware of the fact that there was a very significant minority report to that references committee report which, in most papers, never rated a mention. In those papers that did, there was scarcely a paragraph or there was just a line or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was important in that minority report was that the government members comprehensively refuted each of the issues that were raised in the majority report. I think there was only one article in the press that actually acknowledged this fact. So I ask: where is the democracy in this country if the media are not prepared to provide balanced reporting on such a significant and important issue? If the Canberra press gallery continues to provide such a one-sided ideological approach to an important issue of outsourcing, then I ask: where is democracy? Where is the public going to be able to fully understand this issue? I think it is important that this issue was raised this afternoon to give government members the opportunity to speak to the wider audience, through the broadcast of these particular issues, and to be able to put a correct position to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would scarcely have realised this afternoon in all the questioning to Senator Kemp that Senator Kemp is not the minister for finance and that he is not the minister for outsourcing. In fact, that is handled in the other House by the very responsible Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey&mdash;the minister who was, incidentally, responsible for the very important and successful sale of Telstra. I think all Australians would be applauding the capable manner in which this very successful minister handled the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that must be understood is that Minister Kemp merely represents the Minister for Finance and Administration. Every time the present opposition were unsure of the detail&mdash;and these questions went to detail&mdash;and sought a comprehensive reply, effectively Senator Kemp, as a very competent and effective minister, took those questions on notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to note that the information technology arena is an environment which is moving very rapidly. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moving so rapidly that the minority report agrees with the present and previous governments that it would have been more efficient and more effective for the Commonwealth to have these IT services delivered by the private sector. The Labor Party now that they are in opposition are taking an entirely different approach to outsourcing and the responsibilities. They are taking a different approach to privacy issues from the one they took when they were in government. They paid scant regard to privacy issues in the contracts that they outsourced when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government, the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition, has taken on board very strict privacy issues, set down standards of behaviour and conduct, and put heavy reliance on issues such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Commissioner and so on. Our government is very confident that the consolidation and outsourcing of IT infrastructure, if proven by a market test, will help address and greatly improve the often poorly performing, coordinated and costly systems that have existed in the past. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote a few statements from the minister in respect of that&mdash;that is, the real minister, not the minister who comes in here and pretends to represent the minister. On 25 April this year, the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, announced the government's decision to outsource its information technology infrastructure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to more open, competitive processes for delivery of IT infrastructure services is in keeping with the Government's election commitment to streamline the administration . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On competitive neutrality, the minister said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what competitive neutrality is all about.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are very interesting statements from the minister. But what have we seen? I have to say it is all here in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines</EMPHASIS> . This is the guide that agency and departmental heads are supposed to use when they let contracts. What does it say with regard to open and effective competition? Let us just have a little read.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open and effective competition is the central operating  principle  of  Commonwealth  procurement . . .  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know how IBM Global Services got $30 million worth of government business when a tender was not even called for. It was not even gazetted. With respect to that, section 6 of the government's own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines</EMPHASIS>  under the heading `Contracts arranged' says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finance Regulation 43B requires that agencies notify in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Purchasing and Disposals) Gazette</EMPHASIS>  details of any contract arranged for supplies to be procured or used in Australia where the total estimated liability is $2,000 or more.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why did they not advertise the $30 million department of finance arrangements instead of piggybacking them and handing them over to IBM Global Services? More importantly, a subsidiary company of that company has secured a contract for the servicing of the IT infrastructure in the Department of Finance and Administration, as it now is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does that leave the security? How does that not open up the way for those companies to have access to inside information? Why is that not the case? What is the government going to do about that? I would suggest it is going to do nothing other than continue to make a cock&hyphen;up of this whole process, as you have done to date, Senator Watson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate very much for giving me this opportunity. This is a motion that has been on the book for some time. It is particularly pertinent at the moment with the launch today of a survey of child&hyphen;care services conducted by the New South Wales government. You may recall that, some weeks ago now, NACBCS did a survey in which it was indicated that there was a twofold concern on the part of parents in relation to child care. Firstly, there was the fact that there has been an erosion in the quality of child care, and, secondly, there has been an increase in the fees that parents have had to pay, largely because of the $820 million worth of cuts that have been imposed on child care in the last two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This survey by the New South Wales government, titled `Families at work', has been done of community&hyphen;based child&hyphen;care centres. It indicates that the trend has not abated but is continuing and getting worse. In fact, this survey shows that in New South Wales the average increase in fees is $25 per week presently, and that the increase has varied from $10 up to, in some cases, $40 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences for parents and their children are dire. It means that those children do not have the quality of care that they are entitled to, and, secondly, in many cases, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> families are losing their opportunities to make a choice about their lifestyles. They are having to reduce the hours their children are in care or, alternatively, they are having to leave work or work fewer hours in order to afford the fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes in child care are making it harder for Australian families, and I think it is very important that the Senate takes note of that fact.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than a third of Australian adults&mdash;some 4.7 million people&mdash;now have investments in the share market. Efficient capital markets are central to the Government's objective of achieving higher economic growth and facilitating private sector investment, employment generation and wealth creation. Economic growth depends on the investment of the savings of Australians in productive and innovative ways. Efficient, well supervised securities markets are a vital component of our capital markets and are one of the most important vehicles for economic growth. They provide investment opportunities, enable companies to raise capital, act as an efficient price-discovery mechanism and help to channel resources and savings to their most productive uses. Strategies to promote the standing of our securities markets must be adopted in order to achieve the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8976"> Government's foremost objectives of promoting growth, attracting investment to Australia and creating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), as Australia's leading securities market, plays a central role in the efficient operation of the Australian economy. It provides a market place for the trading of the securities of Australia's leading companies. In reflecting the collective information and judgement of investors, the Exchange channels investors' capital into its most productive uses. By bringing together parties wishing to buy and sell securities, the Exchange facilitates price discovery and reduces transaction costs and settlement risks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The savings of millions of Australians are invested directly or indirectly through the Exchange. The privatisation of one-third of Telstra, together with the recent demutualisations of National Mutual Holdings and Colonial Ltd, will add to the overall market capitalisation of the Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the ASX, in its capacity as a market regulator, is the front line regulator of the day to day operations of the market. The ASX is, therefore, an important national asset and a cornerstone of our capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX is currently organised and governed in a manner that is traditional for stock exchanges. It is a `co-operative' or mutual. Since their origins in coffee-shop meetings of stockbrokers in London and Amsterdam four centuries ago, most stock exchanges around the world have come to be structured as mutual organisations of stock brokers. The Exchange is owned and controlled by its members and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. Its members are the brokers who use the Exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. They are either corporations or firms that are licensed stockbroking organisations, or individuals who are senior employees or directors of stockbroking organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only recently has the continuing appropriateness of this structure been challenged. Substantial changes to the commercial and international environments in which stock exchanges operate have obliged exchanges to radically rethink their corporate governance structures. In 1993 the Stockholm Stock Exchange chose to become a limited liability company whose shares are freely traded. Recently other European exchanges have altered their governance structures in one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stock exchanges operate in a dynamic, competitive and rapidly changing environment that is far removed from the circumstances of yesterday. The world financial system has witnessed dramatic changes and exponential growth over recent decades. New technologies have allowed an increasing range of financial services to be supplied across 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> international borders. Recent events in the world's stock markets highlight the increasing international interdependence of those markets. Exchanges must continually appraise and, if necessary, adapt their governance structures to meet new demands and competitive pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX initiated a review of its governance structure in 1995. That review concluded that the ASX should demutualise, and go one step further than any other stock exchange by listing on its own market and having its shares quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1996, after considering a business case prepared for them, members of the ASX voted to `demutualise' the Exchange, i.e. to convert the Exchange from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. That company would be owned and controlled by its shareholders and conducted as a conventional business for the purpose of yielding a return to its owners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX is, essentially, a private body. It is not funded by Government in the role that it carries out. The Government accepts that the internal governance of the Exchange is, in the first instance, a matter for the Exchange and its owners. The Government has agreed in this bill to facilitate the conversion of the Exchange to a public company. However, the proposal does raise an important issue for Government: namely, how is it to ensure that the public interest in the proper running of the Exchange is protected following the proposed changes to the ASX's governance arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX undertakes three roles within the securities industry. It is a market regulator (self regulatory organisation or SRO); a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business; and a trade association seeking to protect and promote the interests of its members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory responsibilities of the ASX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX's Listing Rules perform an important role in the regulation of listed companies. In making and administering these rules, the ASX occupies a formal, statutorily recognised position in the system of co-regulation of companies and securities with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Important services provided by the ASX include the maintenance of market integrity, fair trading systems, guarantees of trade completion, clearing, settlement and transfer systems and information about stock that is traded. The maintenance of market integrity encompasses a number of important facets including ensuring investors are properly and fully informed about matters affecting listed companies so that their shares can be fairly priced, having trading and settlement systems that are fair and efficient, ensuring that stockbrokers deal fairly and honestly with their clients, and detecting any attempt to mislead the market. Markets characterised by the presence of these elements attract broad 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8977"> investor participation. It is essential that the ASX continues to ensure the honesty and integrity of the securities market for which it is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversion of the Exchange to a company limited by shares represents a significant change to the way in which stock exchanges have traditionally been conducted. The issue, from a policy perspective, is whether the commercial pressures of a `for profit' entity will undermine the commitment of resources and capabilities of the Exchange to effectively fulfil its regulatory and public interest responsibilities to an appropriate standard. To ensure appropriate levels of investor protection, the Corporations Law will be amended to clarify the responsibilities of the ASX as an SRO, and ensure there is appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the Government in carrying out its SRO responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law will impose obligations on the Exchange to do everything necessary to ensure that the market it conducts is an orderly and fair market and self regulatory functions are carried out on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will, in particular, require the Exchange to have adequate arrangements for overseeing stockbrokers, for the settlement of transactions, and for investigating complaints by investors about business transacted on the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure appropriate compliance with these obligations, the bill will empower the Minister to direct the Exchange to attend to certain matters that the Minister believes will promote compliance with the ongoing obligations. In addition, the bill will provide for an annual report by the Exchange of its performance of its SRO responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supervision of a listed ASX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX proposes that its shares be listed on its own exchange. As the ASX is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Listing Rules against all listed companies, there would be a conflict of interest in the ASX monitoring its compliance with, and enforcing, its Listing Rules against itself. To remove the potential for any conflict of interest, the bill provides for the ASC to undertake the supervision of the ASX's compliance with the Listing Rules. The ASX will meet these supervisory costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictions on the ownership of shares in the ASX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the critical role it plays in the national economy, it would not be in the public interest for any one party to gain control of the ASX. The bill thus imposes a statutory limitation of 5 per cent on individual shareholdings in the ASX. A limitation of this order will encourage diverse ownership of the ASX. The 5 per cent limitation will apply to both Australians and foreigners. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation of stockbrokers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current law, stockbrokers must be members of stock exchanges and stock exchanges must ensure that their members are of good character, and conduct themselves accordingly when trading on an exchange. Following demutualisation, the right to trade on the ASX will be available to appropriately qualified and financially sound organisations, whether or not they are members of the ASX. Access to the market will be based on a contract between the ASX and brokers. Those contractual arrangements will not require any ownership interest in the ASX, as at present. While the bill recognises the ASX's altered relationship with brokers, at the same time it ensures that the ASX continues to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants trading on the ASX and in related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to the National Guarantee Fund</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On its conversion to a public company, further approvals of payments from the National Guarantee Fund (NGF) for the ASX's own development would not be available. Such approvals, in circumstances where the benefits of the capital investments funded by those moneys would inappropriately accrue to shareholders of the ASX, will no longer be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no need to make specific provision for these changed circumstances in this bill. The Corporations Law presently confers a broad discretion on the Minister in approving payments out of the National Guarantee Fund for the development of the securities industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the scope of this discretion, the Government proposes that guidelines be developed detailing the circumstances in which payments from the Fund may be approved in light of the ASX's changed circumstances. It is anticipated that payments will continue to be approved for such purposes as investor education and campaign or research projects that will enhance the development of Australia's securities markets, but not for capital development of the Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the bill provides a mechanism for the conversion of the Exchange to a public company. In so doing it gives effect to the decision of members as to the governance arrangements they consider appropriate for the ASX into the next century. Legislation is necessary to effect this change as the Corporations Law does not presently permit a company limited by guarantee to change its status to that of a company limited by shares through administrative procedures, nor facilitate the breaking of the nexus between ownership of a stock exchange and access to the market operated by that exchange.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8978">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More importantly, however, legislation is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of a demutualised ASX as a self regulatory organisation (or SRO), and ensure appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the Government in meeting those responsibilities. Where appropriate, the clarification of these responsibilities will have application to securities exchanges generally, and not solely to the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures proposed by this bill will assist the ASX to compete with regional exchanges and enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's financial sector in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. They will help to deliver significant new employment, income and wealth to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on Government. While additional costs will be incurred by the ASC in supervising the listing of the ASX, the ASX has agreed to reimburse the ASC for these costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Corporations Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the introduction of the bill into Parliament.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8981">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mass poverty is the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Some 1.3 billion people, nearly a quarter of the world's population, continue to live in extreme poverty, trying to survive on less than $1 a day. Over half of these poor are in the Asia Pacific. Even in countries which have been developing rapidly, the vast majority of people are incomparably worse off than ourselves. The average income of people living in Indonesia is a mere 6 per cent of that in Australia, people in China earn only 3 per cent of what we do. The enduring challenge for most of these countries is to provide their people with such basics as food, clean water and education for their children. Meeting this challenge has proven to be no easy task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there were any doubts about the fragility of the development process and the need for Australia to provide effective assistance, these would have been dispelled over the past two months. Recent events such as the severe drought in Papua New Guinea, forest fires in Indonesia and the South East Asian currency realignments bring home the diverse and urgent problems faced by our nearest neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On my most recent visit to Papua New Guinea, earlier this month, I saw at first hand the devastating effects of the worst drought in perhaps one hundred years. Expert assessments&mdash;funded by Australia's aid program&mdash;show that as many as half a million people, in a population of only four million, are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With my colleagues, the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, and my Parliamentary Secretary, Mrs Kathy Sullivan, I flew by RAAF Caribou to Pumani in Milne Bay Province. We wanted to see for ourselves the work funded by our aid program. Stowed in the aircraft were 150 sacks of rice. When we set down, the plight of the people of Papua New Guinea was clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people had not seen rain in many months. There was no fruit on the trees. Vines were brown and withered. The soil had turned to dust. Water supplies were a long distance from homes, and were polluted. Children had the distended bellies we know is a sign of malnutrition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has reacted rapidly and generously to the prospect of this human suffering on our doorstep. Ten Australian Defence Force aircraft are now ferrying essential foods into the most inaccessible areas of Papua New Guinea, to feed the worst affected people. Several Australian NGOs are also assisting with drought relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Prime Minister and I have reassured the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea that Australians will stand by them in their hour of need. If the rains fail, and the next growing season is lost, that need will be immense. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian aid program has played a vital role in nearly every major humanitarian emergency in the world over the last thirty years. But by far the greatest focus of our aid efforts has been on the basic building blocks for sustainable development. Since the establishment of the Colombo Plan in the early 1950s, our aid program has touched the lives of millions of people in developing countries, many of whom are our immediate neighbours. This is a record of which Australia can be proud. It is a record I am committed to continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time I have been concerned that the aid program has been in danger of losing focus on its core developmental role. For this reason, an independent review of Australia's aid program was foreshadowed in our pre&hyphen;election platform, "A Confident Australia"&mdash;and in June last year I instituted such a review. The Review Committee headed by Paul Simons, and including Gaye Hart and Cliff Walsh, produced an excellent report. This report, and the public comments on its recommendations, have played a key role in determining the future directions of Australia's aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OBJECTIVE OF THE AID PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Simons Committee confirmed my concern that the aid program had become burdened down by a range of competing interests. A clear development objective for the aid program is needed. The aid program can not and should not be a vehicle for other purposes, such as short&hyphen;term commercial goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has determined that the objective of the Australian overseas aid program will be, "to advance Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development." This objective is consistent with the course set in the Government's White Paper on Foreign and Trade Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that some people in the community think that there is a choice between dealing with problems at home or providing assistance overseas. This is a misunderstanding and it is self&hyphen;defeating. The promotion of sustainable development overseas and the pursuit of Australia's long&hyphen;term national interest are inextricably linked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who say Australia should not have an overseas aid program are nothing more than political opportunists whose world view extends no further than their front gate. Let us remember, it was the member for Oxley who called for Australia to disband its aid program and then almost immediately after called for increased support for the people of North Korea. She cannot have it both ways. The fact is the provision of well&hyphen;targeted aid gives Australia another strong means of playing a leading role in our developing region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth and rising incomes in developing countries foster stability and expand trade and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8982"> investment opportunities for Australia. The aid program generates considerable goodwill in the region and provides an important foundation for broader bilateral relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aid program is an important instrument for addressing the non&hyphen;military threats to Australian security. The effects of poverty extend beyond national boundaries. Pandemics, illegal migration, refugee flows, global environment problems, narcotics and transnational crime are often directly related to poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aid program, by promoting human rights and addressing the needs of the world's most disadvantaged, is a clear statement of Australian values. I have great faith in the generosity of Australians and our commitment to giving others, much worse off than ourselves, a fair go. We are a country founded on equality and opportunity; we are strengthened by our cultural diversity. These principles extend beyond our shores and will be clearly reflected in our aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRINCIPLES OF OUR AID PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the objective, six key principles will underpin Australia's aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, our aid will be focused on partnerships. Our program will be determined and implemented in partnership with developing countries. This will guarantee that it remains focused on meeting their priority needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, we will be responsive to urgent needs and development trends. Our aid program will provide rapid relief to victims of natural disasters and emergencies and take account of changing pressures in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, our aid will provide practical assistance. It will be realistic in assessing what can and cannot be achieved and will concentrate on practical efforts that can alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth, there will be greater targeting. Australia's aid program cannot afford to be all things to all people&mdash;greater definition and targeting is essential. Clear priorities have been identified, and our efforts will be assessed against these priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifth, our aid program will remain identifiably Australian&mdash;it is a reflection of Australian values and is a projection of these values abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the program will be outward looking. It will be open to new ideas and approaches. It will seek to draw on the best ideas in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRIORITIES FOR AUSTRALIA'S AID</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each one of these principles is designed to bring about a more relevant, higher quality aid program. Using the principles and new objective as a guide, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have developed a set of core priorities for Australia's aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partnerships With Developing Countries</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our partnerships with developing countries form the backbone of Australia's aid program. Detailed country strategies will be prepared for all major programs. These strategies will detail how our aid will alleviate poverty and address sustainable development in each country. Efforts will focus on promoting economic growth, investing in human capital and protecting the most vulnerable groups in society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sectoral Priorities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aid will concentrate on five key sectors&mdash;health, education, infrastructure, rural development and governance&mdash;which have been identified as crucial for sustainable development. They are also sectors in which Australia is well placed to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's aid program has been operating effectively in four of the five sectors for many years and we will continue to ensure that our assistance is well&hyphen;targeted and effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governance will be a new focus for the aid program. Effective governance means competent management of a country's resources in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable, equitable and responsive to people's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will have a particular focus on ensuring that sound fiscal monetary and trade policies are instituted to create an environment for private sector development. I have asked AusAID to develop a policy paper on promoting private sector development through our aid program. We will also undertake practical activities to promote civil and political rights in developing countries. Economies will not achieve their potential unless government is transparent, legal systems are fair, and information flows freely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CROSS&hyphen;CUTTING ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's aid program will place a strong emphasis on ensuring that men and women have equal access to resources and opportunities. Women's needs and perspectives will be considered in the planning and delivery of all Australian aid activities. The aid program will also ensure that the possible impact on the environment is considered in the design and implementation of all projects. We will also play a role in addressing global environment issues such as climate change and biodiversity, which have strong links to the alleviation of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Geographic Focus</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's aid program will continue to concentrate on the Asia Pacific region, Papua New Guinea, the Pacific and East Asia will all be high priorities for Australian assistance. Australia will also continue to concentrate selectively on development needs in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8983"> South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In order for the program to maximise its impact, Australian aid dollars will have a focus on the poorest regions in the countries of the Asia Pacific, for example, in eastern Indonesia and southern Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will also respond flexibly to humanitarian and emergency relief situations&mdash;wherever they arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTERNATIONAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While programs delivered direction from Australia to partner countries will remain the focus of Australia's aid program, we will also play a key role in fostering links with Australian community organisations and be involved in multilateral efforts to tackle poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non&hyphen;government organisations and multilateral institutions play a vital role in development. They complement Australia's bilateral aid efforts by extending the reach and efficiency of the program. They will continue to receive significant support. However, consistent with a more targeted aid program, the Government is taking a more strategic approach to their funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future support for multilateral agencies will take account of the extent to which each agency's mandate contributes to the meeting of Australia's aid objective, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency. NGOs will be expected to demonstrate tangible community support for their development activities. The Government now requires NGOs seeking funding from AusAID to have a recognised development expenditure of at least $30,000 annually. This is part of a rigorous accreditation process to ensure Government funds are channelled through NGOs that have substantial community support and are of sufficient size and professionalism to be able to deliver aid programs overseas. The appropriateness of the $30,000 threshold will be kept under review, in consultation with the NGO community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grants And Loans</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian aid program currently provides bilateral assistance only in the form of grants, regardless of the country, sector and project involved. Grants are not the only way to deliver aid. I believe that, if introduced, the right sort of soft loans would be a useful instrument for aid delivery. Such loans should not be an imitation of Labor's discredited DIFF scheme, which the Simons Committee considered flawed as both aid and industry assistance. I notice that even the Labor Party, which made such a fuss at the time of its abolition, has now decided that a DIFF&hyphen;style scheme should not be part of the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Loans should be driven by recipient needs, rather than Australian industry wishes. They should be integrated with our bilateral aid efforts, not run as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a separate scheme. They should require competitive tendering, not be driven by individual company proposals. The loan projects should also be designed, monitored and evaluated to ensure development quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any decision to introduce a loan scheme would, however, have significant funding implications. While recognising their advantages, soft loans should not squeeze out other high&hyphen;priority aid activities. Consequently, introducing soft loans into the program will depend on future aid budget outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refocusing Aid Management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A permanent advisory committee will be established shortly to advise me on aid and development issues. Such a committee will enable me to hear directly from the broader community about Australia's aid efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AusAID is undertaking a major review of its operations and structures. Significant reforms will be introduced shortly, which focus on improving aid quality.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's aid program must be identifiably Australian. The simplest and most effective method of guaranteeing this is to use Australians in the delivery of the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately one&hyphen;third of Australia's aid program is currently tied to Australian goods and services. Nevertheless, around three&hyphen;quarters of the total aid program is in fact spent on Australian goods and services. While we will make some minor adjustments in the current tying arrangements to increase the quality of the aid program, it is essential that it remain identifiably Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of aid spending will always be a difficult issue. Australia provides significant amounts of overseas aid, consistently spending more than the international donor average. Future levels of aid funding, like all aspects of government expenditure, will be subject to budget considerations. We will continue to support the UN's 0.7 per cent ODA/GNP target and endeavour to maintain our aid at the highest level, consistent with the needs of partner countries and our own economic circumstances and capacity to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while there will always be debates over the size of the aid program, it is important that we make the most of the aid dollar. With over $1.4 billion invested annually in Australia's aid efforts, the Australian community and our developing country partners have the right to demand excellence in our aid program. I believe that Australians can be proud of our development efforts. The new principles and priorities outlined today will result

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination and modification of the national broadcasters' codes of practice are the responsibility of the Boards of the ABC and SBS, consistent with their statutory editorial independence. The ABC and SBS do not believe that this recommendation is necessary or desirable considering the differing charter responsibilities of the national broadcasters and the commercial focus of the licensed broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the Committee's concerns that the lack of uniformity in classification guidelines in the free to air broadcasting sector may increase the scope for idiosyncratic decision making. At the same time the Government is conscious of the value of ensuring a diversity of programming choices, provided by the differing approaches of the national and commercial networks. The issue therefore is whether uniformity across free to air television outweighs all other consider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8987"> ations, particularly given the different purposes of national and commercial broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS codes apply the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) guidelines in the classification of programs and the national broadcasters use the same classification symbols and consumer advice as the commercial broadcasters. The main difference between the FACTS code and those of the ABC and SBS is that the classification criteria are not detailed in the codes in the same manner. However the ABC and SBS codes in combination with their Editorial Policies make explicit the approach they take to classification and the treatment of violence, sex, nudity and language. To the extent that these may differ from FACTS' approach is not necessarily a deficiency but reflects the expression of their charter and policies developed over a number of years of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each sector's approach reflects their charters and programming imperatives which may result in differences even between commercial networks using the FACTS code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the Government has noted the comments made by Mr Bob Mansfield in his report on the ABC. Mr Mansfield reported that as a national broadcaster, the ABC is expected to reflect community standards in terms of content and presentation of material. The issue of standards was raised in a relatively small number of submissions to his review, with 228 (2%) expressing the view that ABC programming in some areas did not meet common standards of morality and decency. Suggestions were made that the ABC and commercial broadcasters should be subject to identical program standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Mansfield expressed the view that he did not regard this as necessary or practical. He argued that given the self&hyphen;regulatory approach to program standards adopted in respect of the commercial sector, it would be inconsistent to require the ABC to meet externally imposed standards. If external standards were imposed on the ABC, it would represent an infringement of the ABC's editorial and programming independence. Also, the program standards developed by the ABC's Code of Practice and Editorial Policies are, with slight differences of emphasis and wording, similar in intent to the Codes developed by FACTS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Mansfield was not convinced that the perceived problem with program standards relates to the ABC's formal standards rather than the interpretation of those standards. In this respect he believes that the ABC has a responsibility to consult widely to determine the standards its audiences expect and to ensure that such standards are met; and that fundamentally the issue of program standards is one for management. In discharging this responsibility, he believes that the ABC must listen to its audience

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In June 1996 the Government referred the draft Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Committee received 26 written submissions on the draft Bill and held hearings on 13 September and 2 October 1996 in Canberra and Sydney respectively. The Committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 18 November 1996. In its report the Committee expresses its approval of the general content of the Bill. The Committee made 11 specific recommendations. It also made several suggestions on matters of detail which the Government has reviewed and, where appropriate, amended the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government wishes to thank the members of the Committee for considering the submissions and preparing their report. The Government also acknowledges the valuable contribution made by those who made submissions to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government proposes to accept or note a number of the Committee's recommendations, in particular, those which would facilitate the orderly calling and conduct of company meetings or which invite the government to consider or review certain matters. However, a number of recommendations would impose additional costs on companies. The Government considers that these recommendations would best be addressed through the ASX's Listing Rules or best practice in corporate governance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Since the Committee's report was tabled the Treasurer has announced the adoption of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. This program will involve a fundamental review of key areas of the Corporations Law affecting business and market activity. It is designed to bring a greater economic focus to corporate law reform, consistent with the Government's objective of facilitating investment, employment and wealth creation while providing investor protection. As part of this program the project of rewriting the Corporations Law will continue. The Second Simplification Bill will be advanced as part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program and has been renamed the Company Law Review Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background to the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Company Law Review Bill will rewrite most of the core company law provisions of the Corporations Law. It will improve and simplify these provisions to make the Law more accessible and encourage efficient business practice by increasing choice and flexibility in the management of companies. For example, the Bill will provide a model framework of default rules for the management of a company's internal affairs (replaceable rules). These rules will be conveniently located within each subject area of the Law and will be able to be replaced or varied to suit the needs of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular companies. The Bill will also enable companies to make greater use of communication technology to hold meetings and exchange documents. The plain English approach taken in drafting the Bill will make the Law more readable and accessible. The Bill will also take up the Committee's suggestion that the person chairing a meeting be referred to as the chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The seven subject areas covered by the Bill are registering companies, meetings, share capital, financial reporting, annual returns, deregistration of defunct companies and company names. The main reforms to be made in each of these areas are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill will make it easier to register a company. It will be possible to register a standard company suitable for operating a typical small business by lodging a single form with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), instead of the several that are currently required. Changing from one type of company to another (eg from a proprietary company to a public company) will be facilitated to enable company structures to best suit their commercial or other objectives. Doing business with a company will also become easier, especially for those who provide finance to companies, because the Bill will reduce the need for third parties to make inquiries about the company's internal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Proprietary companies will be able to pass a wider range of resolutions without incurring the expense of holding a formal meeting. Companies will be able to hold meetings more conveniently and involve a wider range of people. The proxy voting rules will be updated to give members greater certainty and flexibility in exercising their votes. Investors, particularly institutional and overseas investors, will have more time to prepare for general meetings. The Law will expressly recognise that, for public companies, the annual general meeting is an opportunity for shareholders to raise matters of concern with directors and the auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Streamlined provisions will be introduced to deal with the issue of shares (including bonus shares), changing the rights attached to shares, partly-paid shares, dividends and the redemption of redeemable preference shares. The share buy&hyphen;back provisions will be amended to require that a buy-back not materially prejudice a company's ability to pay its creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill will give companies greater flexibility in the management of their share capital. First, it will be easier for companies to return capital to shareholders. This will be particularly useful for companies that have underperforming assets or that wish to dispose of capital assets not required for their core business activities. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8992">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Second, the Bill will replace the outdated concept of par value for shares, so that shares will no longer have a par value. Accounting and financial arrangements by companies will be easier to understand and companies whose shares are traded at a price less than their par value will therefore be able to raise fresh capital without prior approval from the court and their shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill will reinforce the existing prohibition against a company acquiring or controlling its own shares. The rules prohibiting a company from financially assisting a person to acquire its shares will be relaxed so that a company will no longer require shareholder approval for a range of ordinary commercial transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill will improve the framework for financial reporting to members. It will establish within the Corporations Law the general conceptual framework for financial reporting, leaving matters of detail to be addressed in the accounting standards. Companies will have the option of sending concise annual reports to members, saving printing and distribution costs, although full reports will be available on request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Annual returns to the ASC will be much shorter. The Law will expressly recognise that annual returns and other documents can be lodged electronically, with the agreement of the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It will be cheaper and easier to deregister a company that has no liabilities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government supports the use of technology for communication between companies and their members and regulatory authorities. Com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munication technologies accelerate the flow of information in the market, leading to more timely decision&hyphen;making. The Government notes that this is consistent with recommendations made by the Financial System Inquiry that the Law should facilitate electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the current Law companies can only use technology for their meetings if it is permitted by their constitution. The Bill will facilitate the use of technology without requiring a specific provision in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The draft Bill considered by the Committee would allow companies to send notices and proxy documents by fax and to lodge documents electronically with the ASC and its agents. In light of the Committee's recommendations, the Bill will now enable companies to make greater use of communications technology. In particular, companies will be able to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> send notices of meetings to an electronic address nominated by a member; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> receive proxy documents from members electronically if the company has specified an electronic address in the notice of meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government proposes that the use of communications technology in other areas of the Law, such as the provisions dealing with takeovers and fundraising, should be addressed when these areas are dealt with by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government agrees with the Committee that some specific provisions are necessary so that members are properly informed about the intended use of a technology. The Bill will therefore provide that if a members' meeting is proposed to be held at two or more places using technology the notice of meeting must indicate this and also the type of technology proposed to be used. This will enable members to decide whether to attend the meeting in person or via the technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> More generally, the Government believes that provisions dealing with meetings should be consistent across all types of meetings. The use of technology in the conduct of a meeting is merely an extension of the normal meeting procedures and should be treated as far as possible as other meetings. For example, a breakdown in video&hyphen;conference technology has similar effect as the failure of microphones at a normal meeting. If a meeting does not give members a reasonable opportunity to participate, the existing law enables a court to declare the meeting invalid if a substantial injustice has resulted. The Government considers that this is also the appropriate outcome for members' meetings held at two or more places using technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to directors' meetings, the Government accepts that directors must give reasonable notice before withdrawing consent to the use of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8993"> technology at a meeting. However, the Law should allow directors and the company more generally to devise their own solutions concerning the consequences of a failure of technology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Committee recommends that the right of an individual director to call a meeting of members should be a mandatory rule for listed companies.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bill will allow individual directors of companies, operating under the replaceable rules to be inserted into the Law, to call members' meetings. A company will be able to adopt a constitution and displace the rule through its constitution. It is envisaged that widely&hyphen;held companies would displace the rule. The rule is primarily designed for closely&hyphen;held companies to allow a members' meeting to be called with a minimum of formality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For listed companies, a single director may wish to call a meeting to pass a resolution (eg removing a director or amending the company's constitution) or to publicise a matter of concern. However, for listed companies, calling a members' meeting is a significant and potentially costly action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government believes that listed companies should be able to decide for themselves whether individual directors are able to require the company to hold a members' meeting. The Bill provides other safeguards for minority shareholders, such as allowing 100 members or members with 5 per cent of the votes to be able to require the directors to convene a meeting. The right of a director to call a meeting unilaterally would therefore only be relevant in practice where a director is unable to obtain this level of support for a resolution. It is therefore not considered necessary or appropriate to accept this recommendation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Law currently provides that, if the directors have failed to call a meeting requested by members, the directors who are in default are liable to reimburse the company out of their fees for the cost of calling and holding the meeting. The draft 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bill originally held all directors liable for failing to call a meeting. While this was intended to provide an incentive for compliance by directors, the Government accepts that some exemption should be offered to directors who act diligently. The Bill will therefore exempt from liability directors who can show they took all reasonable steps to cause a general meeting requested by the members to be held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the common law a meeting that has not been called for a proper purpose can be declared invalid. It was suggested to the Committee that members may requisition meetings for improper purposes, without being aware that the meeting would be invalid, and that this would cause the company unnecessary costs and inconvenience. To address this concern the Bill will include a provision stating the general common law position that general meetings must be called for a proper purpose. This will help to make members aware of the limited nature of their power to request a meeting. The rule will apply to all members' meetings as there is no reason to distinguish between meetings called by members and those called by directors.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Institutional investors, particularly those outside Australia, have argued that a 28 day notice period is required to give them sufficient time to receive, consider and respond to a notice of meeting (eg to appoint a proxy).

This will vary depending on the structure of the company's membership.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As at present, the Bill will allow resolutions to be passed either on a show of hands or on a poll. The current position under the Corporations Law is that resolutions may be carried on a show of hands but a poll may be demanded by the chairman or 5 members (including a proxy) or members holding 10 per cent of the votes. The Bill will reduce this to 5 per cent for consistency with other provisions conferring rights on shareholders in relation to meetings. Voting on a show of hands allows the company to progress meetings in a timely and efficient manner while the ability to call a poll provides a safeguard for matters which are closely contested.</PARA>

The Government considers that allowing proxy voters to count towards the call for a poll would be likely in practice to render voting on a show of hands redundant, as most resolutions would be decided on a poll, putting companies to additional expense and inconvenience and changing the character of the meeting. Given that the Bill will allow proxies to be lodged electronically, the Committee's recommendation would have a similar effect to the introduction of electronic voting.

The government's prescription in the draft direction is in our view deficient in that it makes no provision for consultation with unions and employee representatives in the development of diversity programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was on Senator Harradine's suggestion last night that I deferred opposition amendment No. 2 in relation to the definition of designated groups. In accepting the arguments that Senator Harradine put forward, I think it is appropriate to group that definition of designated groups with amendment No. 18. That definition in opposition amendment No. 2 is taken from the current Public Service Act. I commend both these amendments to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is consequent to the defeat yesterday of our amendment which put forward a whole part and is also consequent to the very evident sympathy expressed from both the coalition side and the Labor side on matters to do with whistleblower protection. I accept that the Senate has made a decision that, to get full treatment, the whistleblower matter should be subject to a separate bill to be delivered by the Attorney-General, but the government has clearly intended that some minimal protection be provided for whistleblowers and has provided for that in clause 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that clause 16, the opposition successfully put an amendment which added that the Merit Protection Commissioner should also be accessed by any employee who felt that he or she needed appropriate protection. However, because of the evident support for the general principles of ensuring that the terms and conditions of Public Service employees should include protection for whistleblowers, I thought I would come back to the committee and make a further attempt to persuade senators to strengthen that provision in a manner which would be to the advantage of the employees of the Public Service and, I believe, to the advantage of the parliament and the people as a whole, since it would go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9000"> some way towards encouraging greater accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first part of clause 16, the government at the moment has the words `must not victimise or discriminate against'. We have added the words `must not victimise, intimidate, harass or discriminate'. We have stretched that out once again based on our readings of the various royal commissions, inquiries and laws that apply in these areas which use the extended phraseology I have spelt out here. The second thing we have done is add the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . the APS employee has . . . made a public interest disclosure&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The great weakness of the protection for whistleblowers provided by the government is that it only relates to breaches or alleged breaches of the code of conduct. Frankly, that is too narrowly confined, and it is our view that APS employees should also be protected when they have made a public interest disclosure. Senators should note that that in itself is a confined protection, since that disclosure can only be made to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(i) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commissioner or a person authorised for the purposes of this section by the Commissioner; or</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is not as if it is a widely publicised area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third addition we have made is item (b), which is where they have reported an alleged wrongdoing. Once again, this picks up on wording and an intention which is expressed in other legislation and other recommendations where you are dealing with the issue of protection for whistleblowers. In a small but significant sense we seek to enlarge clause 16. We think is to the benefit of APS employees. We think it is to the benefit of accountability. It still includes all the elements that the government had put in and that the opposition had put in with their amendment. Accordingly, I commend our amendment to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say very clearly that it is not to suggest that in principle these suggestions, these proposals, do not have merit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The genesis for the government's position came from chapter 8 in the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. There was not actually a recommendation made, but there were a number of comments made in relation to this matter. Paragraph 8.47 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">non-SES employees</EMPHASIS> , the Committee accepts that the protections afforded by the Workplace Relations Act against termination of employment provide an adequate safeguard against unfair termination decisions which are commensurate with the protections afforded to workers in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to this amendment, we again have the situation where it is perhaps all in sawdust that the inclusion of this amendment is taking over the provisions of section 170CK of the Workplace Relations Act, which deals with the grounds on which people's employment is not to be terminated. It provides a list of reasons for which employment must not be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that that apply. If you bring in these two considerations, you leave litigation effectively open in relation to two pieces of legislation; that is, the Workplace Relations Act and this Public Service Act that was passed. The government believes that there may be some overlay in relation to that. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9009"> therefore opposes the amendments put by the opposition. Some of the reasons for which employment cannot be terminated in the Workplace Relations Act include union membership or participation, non-membership of a union and temporary absence due to illness or injury. There are some quite straightforward and commonsense reasons which would protect any worker.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it thought by the government that what is proposed in the amendment would so conflict on occasion with the provisions of the workplace relations legislation that it would be less beneficial than the provisions of the workplace relations legislation and thus create a situation where the employee may take action to see that the more beneficial regime is applied? First of all, is it not a fact that if one makes specific requirements upon agency heads, as is proposed under this amendment, that that then overrides the provisions of the workplace relations legislation? Under those circumstances, there would be no such cause for concern on the government's part as to the possibility of litigation. Secondly&mdash;perhaps the clarification should come from the mover of the amendment as well as the government&mdash;is it being suggested that these criteria for termination of employment that we are considering may in some way be less beneficial than the provisions in the Workplace Relations Act?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When one compares the list of reasons with the ones contained in the opposition amendment, one could at first blush say that the opposition's amendment is not as comprehensive as the reasons outlined in the Workplace Relations Act. It is perhaps more accurate to say that they cover different areas. So if you pass this, you could exclude certain aspects of those reasons contained in 170CK in so far as they are inconsistent and then leave it questionable as to the remainder of the workplace relations provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment deals with unsatisfactory work performance. The Workplace Relations Act provision deals with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> temporary absence due to illness or injury. There is then absence on maternity or parental leave. They are more specific than unsatisfactory work performance, but perhaps they would come under that umbrella. Look at the question of the loss of essential qualifications. Could you say that that relates to membership or otherwise of a union? Does that relate to qualifications? Perhaps it concerns that provision in the workplace relations legislation which deals with race, colour, sex or sexual preference except if an inherent requirement of a particular position is for that, which you have these days. Under the Racial Discrimination Act, you can have positive discrimination, as it is called, where, to remedy disadvantage to a particular part of the community, there is provision for only Aboriginal people to apply for a position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are dealing with is different terminology, different phrasing and different areas of the Workplace Relations Act compared to the provisions contained in (a) to (e) of the opposition amendment. The government sees the problem here more as being a cause of confusion and uncertainty rather than limiting the rights of the worker. It could well make them more uncertain, but I do not think, in fairness, I could say that it would reduce them. I would have to sit down and have a more thorough examination of the comparison between the two. In the first instance, confusion and uncertainty are totally undesirable.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, the amendment would restrict the ability of the government&mdash;presumably after considerable consultations with those who are affected; and that no doubt would be ensured&mdash;and may, indeed, limit the opportunity of the public servants concerned to access some other benefits that may flow from the fact that they have retired at age 50 instead of age 55.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a classic proposal. It probably came from Treasury because, if you analyse the proposition, as I did, it turns out that at least in the first five years Treasury would be getting heaps of money because something like 17 per cent, or thereabouts, of the employees concerned die before they reach the age of 70 and, therefore, would not be eligible for the age pension. So that is a saving, is it not? And they, of course, would be contributing to Treasury all of the time via the pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn tax system.

That was not so much the case 30 or 20 years ago, but that occupation did become more stressful recently with increased traffic in the air and more technological demands made in the area.

All it can do is to deny the government the structure it sets up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For clarification, we are dealing with Senator Faulkner's amendments on sheet No. 695. I have a couple of matters for Senator Faulkner. Let us not beat around the bush. The previous government abolished the appeal provisions for SES people. In this discussion, we have been talking about what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Senator Faulkner, you yourself mentioned that in support of one of the previous amendments in relation to termination of employment, yet it was the previous government that actually withdrew these appeal rights of SES people. If your proposal is what is good for the goose is good for the gander, then what argument do you have to sustain what you are proposing now&mdash;unless this does apply to the SES?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in two minds about this. As a matter of fact, I must say from the start that, because those rights are currently there, I am inclined to support them. As Senator Ellison has said, the government has the provisions in its proposed Public Service regulations, of which it has given all of us an advanced copy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An outline of the review process is listed in a nice diagram on page 4. This looks to be not so much a complex but a developed review process. If this developed review process is going to work in practice, then it will need to be supported by resources. That comes to the question of the Merit Protection Commissioner. In the diagram you have got 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the agency head making a decision and then the affected employee applies in writing for a review&mdash;that the first-tier review. Then the agency head reviews the action, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the employee is dissatisfied, then that employee can go to the Merit Protection Commissioner, who then reviews the decision and makes recommendations to the agency head. Alternatively, the affected public servant may apply directly in certain circumstances to the Merit Protection Commissioner, who may then refer the matter to an independent reviewer who reviews the action. Recommendations are then made to the agency head. I will not go into that any further, but it is clear that this is intended to be a substantive attempt to provide justice to public servants. At present the structure is the review procedures under the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point of resources. What kinds of resources is it envisaged that the government will provide for these procedures to be properly effective? In other words, what is the government proposing to do about the Merit Protection Commissioner, the establishment of an office of the Merit Protection Commissioner and the staffing of the commissioner's office? What amount has been set aside or considered to be necessary for independent reviewers? Who are the interdependent reviewers? Where are they going to come from? They are the sorts of things that the committee really needs to know before the committee can adequately deal with the matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen nice plans like these in the regulations from time to time, but sometimes they have been done by people with airy&hyphen;fairy ideas and who do not have their feet on the ground. I am not suggesting that this is the case; I am taking it at face value that the government does want to have a process which does give justice to employees aggrieved by the decisions of the agency head. Minister, what are the resources that the government proposes should be applied for this purpose?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to assure the minister and the committee that one of my questions was not who the Merit Protection Commissioner was going to be. I was interested to know where the independent reviewer is to come from. It is a bit vague; that is the problem. Despite the point that the goose and gander argument can be used against what is being proposed by the opposition as, when in government, the opposition cancelled the rights of the SES in regard to these matters, I still feel that it has not been sufficiently explained how this process is going to be a real deterrent against the nepotism that theoretically may be applied in agencies by certain agency heads.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, my amendment on sheet 780 is a float, but it puts in writing what actually occurs with agencies at the moment. They have a tripartite arrangement. As I understand it, they certainly can have it; it is provided for. I had hoped that if we could get to a situation where certain other matters could be referred to under the current structure in the legislation, similar to what is being proposed by Senator Faulkner, we might have been able to get something along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are very serious questions for appeal, but if this other procedure were adopted in the first instance, then it may well be that that would be sufficient to enable the provisions of clause 33 of the government's bill, the review of actions, to apply if the provisions floated in my amendment applied in respect of engagements or promotions of APS employees. It is in that area where the real problem that the government sees applies. It is in that area that the government, as far as I hear the government saying, holds up a whole series of actions that the agency head might wish to take in the time that it takes for appeals to be finalised and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, I will be voting for the opposition amendments, but in the second round&mdash;and there is no doubt we will we have one&mdash;it might well be that the government might have a look at this and come forward with a proposal that its structure contained in the draft regulations could apply to the disciplinary and major promotion areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our belief, however, is that, in relation to matters of whistleblowing which the government has attended to under clause 16 in a minimalist sense, there may still be a need to provide advice to APS employees in relation to those disclosures and to provide support to APS employees in relation to those disclosures including through the provision of education programs, counselling, protection, re&hyphen;employment assistance and safeguarding of documents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is extraordinary that no government minister or parliamentary secretary has deemed these bills significantly important enough to be in the chamber. Despite some 14 months having passed since the government announced the surcharge tax measure designed to apply an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of high income earners, here we are again about to debate a package of six complicated amendment bills which will supposedly fix the many problems associated with the government's ill&hyphen;conceived and error ridden 15 per cent superannuation tax measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recently confirmed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9026"> that even with these amendment bills, this measure may still not apply to some defined benefit superannuation funds. In that evidence the committee heard that these bills will not fix what is a fundamentally flawed and disastrous superannuation policy. That evidence also showed that these amendment bills have the potential to make things even more complicated and unfair&mdash;for example, the inconsistent superannuation tax treatment of those in defined benefit schemes compared with those in accumulation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor and a whole litany of industry representatives, consumer representatives, superannuation specialists and the superannuation select committee, now in two separate reports, told the government that this legislation would not work. The government was told time and time again that its collection method was too complicated, that it would impact on low and middle income earners, that it would cost more to implement than the revenue it would collect and that it would undermine people's confidence in superannuation as a savings vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we can add to that list of critics, thanks to the recent Senate select committee hearings into these bills, Mr Noel Davis, a superannuation lawyer from the law firm Clayton Utz&mdash;I might say that law firm is the law firm which retained the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a direct consultant to it for many years, and therefore I guess it is the Prime Minister's law firm&mdash;who said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my 20&hyphen;odd years of practice in this area, this is by far the worst legislation that I have seen.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is bad legislation and it was enacted purely out of political expediency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all know what the political expediency that Mr Davis is referring to is&mdash;a broken election promise by the coalition not to increase any existing taxes or introduce any new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason the government chose a complex and constitutionally doubtful collection method. To collect the superannuation tax in a way which was administratively simplest and most cost effective would have meant breaking solemn commitments made before the last federal election neither to raise the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rate of existing taxes nor to introduce any new taxes, but that is exactly what this is&mdash;a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did the government deal with the fact that it was breaking its promise not to introduce any new taxes and not to increase existing taxes? It tried to deceive the Australian public by implementing what it called a surcharge, but which everyone in the country knew was really another tax. It tried to slip a new tax on superannuation past the people of Australia by calling it a surcharge and hoping that nobody would notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People did notice. They noticed and they did not like being deceived. They are not impressed by governments who try to disguise broken election promises by calling a tax a surcharge. It did not work anyway. The superannuation tax which the government tried to hide by calling it a surcharge is now called a tax because of amendments in the Senate which were designed to inject some honesty into the debate and to give the government the opportunity to go back to the drawing board and design a better collection method for the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that did not happen. The government has chosen to persist with its flawed collection method for the superannuation tax when it could have saved us and itself a lot of trouble in the first place by calling the surcharge a tax and administering it in the most efficient manner possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is an example of what we can expect from this government by way of taxation reform, it is no wonder that Australians are quaking in their boots at the thought of a GST. This surcharge tax measure has severely undermined any credibility the coalition government had, if it had any after 1993, on taxation reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So despite the advice offered the last time we debated these bills, despite the willingness and encouragement from the opposition for the government to change its method of collection of the superannuation tax, here we are again debating a set of bills designed to fix the government's superannuation tax mess. The opposition believes the government should&mdash;indeed, has an obligation to&mdash;clean up its own superannuation tax mess.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9027">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not opposed to the intent of these bills which apply the superannuation tax to high income earners excluded from the flawed original legislation and will not be opposing the second reading of the bills. However, we do have some concerns about these bills and will be moving some appropriate amendments which we believe will go some way towards making this flawed and unfair measure more sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that the Australian Democrats will be moving a second reading amendment calling for the delay of these bills, requiring the government to consult further with the industry and providing an extension of time for defined benefit funds to report to the Australian Taxation Office. Labor will not be supporting the amendment for several reasons. It is interesting that the Democrats are taking such a principled stand on this issue given that they, along with Green senators, supported the government's surcharge tax legislation last time we debated this measure in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Democrat senators are now listening to the criticisms about this measure, many of which are the same criticisms that were around last time. We welcome this newfound concern for the superannuation tax collection method but lament the fact that it is a bit late. The measure already applies to many superannuation funds and will be paid by thousands of low and middle income earners regardless of whether these bills are passed or not. That is a reality which cannot be ignored and should not be forgotten by those who previously supported this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Delaying these bills a further two weeks and forcing the government to consult with industry will not result in a better piece of legislation simply because the government is not listening to industry. We have already gone through an extensive consultative process via the Senate select committee hearings. Consider the evidence to the committee from Mr Noel Davis, a partner and superannuation lawyer with Clayton Utz, the Prime Minister's legal firm, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">You, at your end, have not seen this, but the arrogance of the government in its responses or its lack of responses to people who have put a great 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deal of time and effort into putting forward genuine submissions as to what the problems are, and were, with this act, and the arrogance with which those submissions have been dealt with, had to be seen to be believed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So delaying these bills another two weeks so that the industry can talk to an arrogant blank wall, or an empty vessel in the case of Senator Kemp, on this issue, or even forcing the government to talk to the industry, is a waste of time when the government has shown that it is unwilling to listen to constructive criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills will give the Commissioner of Taxation the discretion to extend the time that a fund has to report to the Australian Taxation Office. There is thus no need to provide an across-the-board extension of time to defined benefit funds, provided the commissioner is fair and reasonable in using his discretion to extend the reporting date. So this stunt by the Democrats has no substance and arises because they understand the gravity of the error they made in making a deal with the government to pass what Mr Davis from Clayton Utz, a renowned industry expert, has referred to as `by far the worst legislation I have seen'. We oppose it not because we disagree with the objectives of the Democrats' second reading amendment but because we know it will not achieve those objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are some of the errors which these amendment bills are supposed to fix? Before the Senate committee examined these amendment bills, I would have counted at least 10 superannuation tax bungles but, since then, more bungles have been revealed which the government, up till now, has not provided any sensible answers to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is that the superannuation tax did not apply to state politicians, judges and public servants because they are in constitutionally protected schemes. The government was hoping to get the states to pass complementary legislation which would have allowed the tax to be collected from state public servants, judges and politicians but, unfortunately, that has not gone as was hoped. The states, especially so-called conservative states such as South Australia and Western Australia, gave the government a big N&hyphen;O no on the super tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9028">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the failure of the government to get the cooperation of the states, we have here as part of this package two additional bills which will have the superannuation tax apply to these fund members. True to form with this superannuation tax, the way that the government is proposing to do this will create even further complexity, confusion and uncertainty for both superannuation funds and the fund members affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the superannuation tax collection method for schemes which are not constitutionally protected is different from the collection method for constitutionally protected schemes. Both superannuation funds will be required to notify the Australian Taxation Office of a member's taxable superannuation contributions, however, for constitutionally protected schemes, it will be the fund member who is liable for the superannuation tax rather than the superannuation fund itself. This, of course, differs from schemes which are not constitutionally protected where the superannuation fund itself is liable for the superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that one of the reasons the government claimed that its superannuation tax was not actually a tax was that it said the superannuation funds will be paying it, not the individual member. But, for constitutionally protected schemes, the opposite will be happening. It is a tax on individual fund members administered by the Australian Taxation Office. So the government's feeble defence that it was not breaking an election promise now stands completely exposed. One has to then ask the question: why is the government persisting with this crazy collection method when it has undermined its own arguments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bungle in the superannuation tax legislation was the government's failure to include federal public servants, judges and politicians. It is amazing to think that the government came up with a policy which did not include its own employees. One would have thought that the government would have been able to at least ensure that its own employees set an example by paying the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third bungle was the government's admission that it would have to redraft the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation to correct problems in collection from the defined benefit funds. This problem arose from the government's attempt to make the legislation fit within the constitution after Dennis Rose QC pointed out that the tax was unconstitutional. While that doubt still appears to exist, according to some, these bills appear to include high income earners in defined benefit schemes, albeit in an incredibly complex and expensive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth bungle related to evidence suggesting that the tax could be an eligible tax deduction. It is absolutely absurd that a tax which is intended to raise revenue for the government could be considered as a tax deduction, therefore, negating the whole value of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth bungle relates to concerns that, in defined benefit funds with benefit cliffs, individuals would be assessed as having a total superannuation tax liability of higher than 15 per cent. The government seems to have understood the unfairness of the impact of this measure and has now apparently moved to ensure that it does not happen. However, as the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation reported, there are problems of consistency surrounding this measure. That makes five bungles which this package of bills is proposing to rectify but which, according to the Senate select committee hearings into these bills, will only add to the complexity of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disappointing aspect of the next set of bungles that I will identify is that they are errors in the government's model which no amount of legislative tinkering will adequately fix. The only way the government could fix the mess it has created would be to change the entire foolish collection method it has adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the government's legislative amendments are, unfortunately, too late to prevent rises in fees and charges as superannuation funds put in place ridiculously complicated schemes to collect and process the information needed to pass on to the Australian Taxation Office. The estimated collection costs could be up to $100 million, with some estimates at more than $200 million. Then there is the huge cost to superannuation funds 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9029"> of having to collect thousands of tax file numbers from members who, for their own reasons of privacy, may have chosen not to give their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds. A perspective on the government's cost bungle is offered again by Noel Davis who, in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the deficiencies and complexities of the legislation imposing this tax . . . the cost of implementing the administration systems to collect the tax will probably exceed the amount of the revenue received by the Government from it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that is absolutely incredible. The cost of implementing the superannuation tax collection system could exceed the revenue the government receives from it. Why? Because of the deficiencies and complexities of the legislation, according to Mr Davis, who is an expert in superannuation law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government clearly does not care about is that, as superannuation funds pass on these added collection costs to fund members by increasing fees and charges, those increases will disproportionately affect low and middle income earners. In other words, government claims that this is a tax on higher income earners&mdash;those earning over $70,000 per annum&mdash;are false. Lower and middle income earners will be paying higher fees and charges in order that the government can collect it. So much for the government's claims in its budget boasts last year that it was attacking the top end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another bungle is the revelation that up to one million lower and middle income earners would have to pay the tax, as supported by evidence to the Senate superannuation committee. Mr Peter Downes, from Jacques Martin, advised the committee of the poor success rate that Jacques Martin&hyphen;administered superannuation funds have had in obtaining tax file numbers from members. After some three attempts to collect tax file numbers from fund members, Jacques Martin have had only a 23 per cent success rate. That means that thousands of low and middle income earners will pay this tax measure which is supposed to impact on high income earners. With evidence such as this, perhaps Senator Kemp may like to rethink his constant reassurance to the Senate that low and middle income 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earners need not pay the surcharge. Clearly, many people are not providing their tax file numbers and will be subject to the surcharge tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the actuarial concerns about the guidelines for assessing the tax liabilities of individuals in the defined benefit funds. Some actuaries have already indicated that they will be unable to prepare some individuals' tax liability assessments in time for superannuation funds to meet the government's 15 December deadline for reporting to the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was reconfirmed during the Senate committee hearings and is a matter of considerable concern. The government announced back in August last year that the superannuation tax was coming, yet we still have a situation where people in defined benefit funds are unable to know just what the impact of these changes will be on their superannuation entitlements as the 15 December deadline approaches. As we come towards a year and a half after the government first announced these changes, it is simply not good enough that people in these funds are unable to ascertain what their superannuation situation actually will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last bungle is the inequitable tax treatment of golden handshakes, depending on whether they are taken as cash or rolled over. Labor will be moving an amendment on this issue to make it fairer and more consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is it&mdash;at least 10 original superannuation tax bungles of which this legislation will fix only five, and even that is doubtful. It would be nice to think it would stop there but, with the complexity of these measures, I am not sure that is so. Unfortunately, no amount of fiddling will fix a bad policy, which regrettably appears to have caused a decline in confidence in the entire superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has worked hard since 1983 to build Australia's enviable three pillars retirement income system, of which superannuation is a crucial component. Over the period when Labor was in government, there was an enormous change in focus given to superannuation saving as part of the government's retirement income policy objectives. It was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9030"> Labor which positioned superannuation to make a major contribution towards achieving our national savings objectives over the medium term. We overwhelmingly succeeded in our objective of extending access to superannuation benefits throughout the work force, especially to women and part&hyphen;time employees who previously were largely excluded. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of six superannuation bills we are considering here today seeks to amend the superannuation high income earners tax surcharge ahead of the 15 December deadline for reporting by superannuation funds on liabilities. In particular, the bills seek to impose a new taxation regime on the constitutionally protected state funds which refuse to impose the surcharge by taxing the employees themselves. The bills amend various aspects of the tax surcharge law&mdash;making it a mind&hyphen;numbingly complex piece of legislation, even more complicated and difficult to administer. I wish to remind the Senate that it need not have been this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government had accepted the recommendations of the Senate superannuation committee&mdash;which were supported, I might say, by virtually all the superannuation, business and worker representatives before the committee&mdash;a far more appropriate collection mechanism would have been in place, with the tax being levied on employees through group certificates. Instead, the tax has been levied on the funds, with the funds facing the massive administrative task of tracking down tax file numbers for 16 million account holders to identify just 350,000 or so people who are liable to pay the surcharge. Along the way, the tax collection mechanism has become more and more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May, the Democrats agreed somewhat reluctantly to support the government's collection mechanism when it was clear that the government would not move to close the massive tax concession on superannuation with a fairer tax collection mechanism. But we set two clear conditions on our support. First, we said that we wanted to be assured that low and middle income earners would not end up paying the surcharge in error as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> result of not being aware that they must provide a tax file number. Second, we sought an assurance from the Treasurer that the government would keep an open mind to reducing administrative problems with the tax as they arose. This legislation we are told by the government represents the results of months of negotiation with industry aimed at making the tax more workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry was somewhat surprised at this characterisation. Indeed, evidence to the Senate superannuation committee showed that industry regards these bills as adding to compliance costs, making reporting requirements even more onerous and failing to fix glaring anomalies with the existing legislation. The Democrats want to see a workable tax surcharge on high income earners. We want to see a tax which is easily understood, where complicated costs are minimised but where the revenue is still properly protected. We want to ensure that low and middle income earners are not inadvertently caught up in the net of the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Based on the evidence before the committee, I have come to the view that this legislation fails to meet these objectives. I am not convinced that the government has properly negotiated with industry on minimising compliance costs and that this legislation is as simple as it could be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me cite just some of the current problems with the superannuation surcharge legislation: the difficulty of persuading members to provide tax file numbers, with just 23 per cent of members providing them, despite three requests and the possible need for further education measures to minimise the prospect that low income workers might be caught up in the tax surcharge; the costs of collecting information from the large number of people who have exited the superannuation system since August 1996 and the added difficulty of then collecting the tax from them; new requirements in the amending bills were suddenly made retrospective to August 1996; the near impossibility of the maybe 200 available actuaries in Australia completing the work needed on 15,000 defined benefits funds to report to the tax office before 15 December deadline; continuing confusion about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9031"> meaning of the requirements in the act itself; and the inconsistent treatment of different superannuation funds in enforcing the government intent that benefits will not be reduced by more than 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other problems with the legislation include: the difficulties associated with the application of the surcharge to allocated surplus funds, in particular, in its possibly inadvertent extension to accumulation funds; the inconsistent treatment of eligible termination payments as to whether they are paid out or rolled over in application of the surcharge; complexity of reporting requirements to the tax office on trustees beyond what is necessary for operation of the legislation; clarifying who can make payments to offset surcharge debts; unfair treatment where tax surcharge overpayments are made in terms of characterisation as an ETP and payment of interest; possible over taxation of partly invested benefits; underestimation of the difficulties and time delays in obtaining the actuarial reports necessary to implement the legislation, particularly in the absence of practice guidelines from the Institute of Actuaries; and failure by the drafters of the legislation to minimise compliance costs for funds in the collection of the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues were all placed before the Senate superannuation committee. The industry has raised other issues with me, and no doubt with other members of the committee since that time. I wish to emphasise that the Democrats do support the superannuation tax surcharge. As I understand, the opposition does too. But let us do everything we can to make this tax work effectively. I was prepared to give the government time to properly address these issues but the Democrats cannot support this package of amendments without these very important issues being dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry estimates the costs of complying with this legislation at upwards of $100 million this year. Add on to that the hefty losses many funds incurred in the stock market fall, and we are looking at serious cuts in fund returns this year for all members. I think the Senate would be remiss if it did not do all that it could to improve this legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the second reading I had intended to move to defer the bill's second reading for two weeks in order to require the government to have another go at amendments to reduce compliance costs. The motion also called on the government to agree to an amendment to extend the deadline for defined benefit funds to 1 March. That, I suggest, would have been a huge relief for the 15,000 defined benefit funds facing the impossibility of reporting by 15 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should act to preserve the 15 December reporting date for accumulation funds. But, even there, we should aim to ensure that the reporting requirements are the minimum reasonably necessary to collect the tax, and this review of the more onerous reporting requirements tendered in this legislation will help achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the coalition and the ALP have now indicated that they are opposed to my second reading amendment because of the cut&hyphen;in of the native title legislation. So I will not be proceeding with that. However, based on evidence to the Senate committee, I will foreshadow that the Democrats have drawn up a list of 15 areas where we believe that the bills need to be amended. I have given this list to all parties, particularly the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am still awaiting a response from the government to my list, and I would expect to be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage. I will circulate these to senators as soon as they are available and will keep interested senators informed as to the progress of the response from the government. As I said, the Democrats objective is not to obstruct this bill, rather to make it better and more workable. I will return to that topic in some detail during the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my contribution tonight by thanking the superannuation committee secretariat for again preparing a report on very short notice and under such difficult circumstances. I also thank those who took the time to make oral and written submissions to the committee hearings. The committee sought at all times to assist the government with its legislative program, but it really put the committee behind the eight ball. It was so rushed that the majority of the presentations, despite their excellent standard, were purely oral. An attempt was made to get the committee to report even before the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  was available so that very complex issues could be read for the first time. It is disappointing to see that the government members on the committee decided to simply go along with the process in what really is a fairly ordinary report on their part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite some 14 months having passed since the government announced the surcharge tax measure, here we are again debating another piece of legislation on this shambles of a measure before we are able to have any true understanding of the implications. I describe this measure as a shambles because of the way in which the government has chosen to implement it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor referred these bills to the superannuation committee for public hearings, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9033"> we were not sure what type of response we would get. There was a concern that people were so fed up with the measure that they could not be bothered going to the trouble and expense of preparing submissions and showing up for the hearings&mdash;particularly when it was clear that the government is not listening to what the industry or anybody else is saying. As Noel Davis, a partner and superannuation lawyer with Clayton Utz, said to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You, at your end, have not seen this, but the arrogance of the government in its responses or its lack of responses to people who have put a great deal of time and effort into putting forward genuine submissions as to what the problems are, and were, with this act, and the arrogance with which those submissions have been dealt with, had to be seen to be believed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, on the contrary, with just two days notice, we had some excellent presentations from industry representatives and individuals who showed that the fire is still in the belly on the super tax measure. The government should be on notice. They are a laughing stock over this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence presented to the committee was highly critical of the surcharge tax collection method chosen by the government. Further evidence from Mr Davis was particularly scathing. Senator Cook has already alluded to it, but it is so scathing that it is worth putting it on the record a second time. Mr Davis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my 20-odd years of practice in this area, this is by far the worst legislation that I have seen . . . It is bad legislation and it was enacted purely out of political expediency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all know what the political expediency is that Mr Davis is referring to&mdash;a broken election promise by the coalition not to increase any existing taxes or introduce any new taxes. But&mdash;and this is why this measure is such a shambles&mdash;the government tried to sneak this new tax past the people of Australia by calling it a surcharge and using what must be the most complicated collection method in taxation history.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is funnier than my bow tie. Perhaps the worst aspect of this government's persistence with the complex collection method it has chosen is that it will unfairly affect low and middle income earners, who will pay for the collection of the surcharge tax in higher administration costs and will pay the surcharge tax itself if they do not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee heard evidence from Jacques Martin of the poor success rate that Jacques Martin administered superannuation funds have had in obtaining tax file numbers from members. After some three attempts to collect tax file numbers from fund members, Jacques Martin have had only a 23 per cent success rate. That means that thousands of low and middle income earners will pay this tax measure which is supposed to impact only on high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With evidence such as this, the Assistant Treasurer  (Senator Kemp) might like to rethink his constant reassurance to the Senate that low and middle income earners need not pay the surcharge if they provide their tax file number. Clearly, many people are not providing their tax file numbers and will be subject to the surcharge tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government clearly expressed an urgency in seeing these amendment bills passed by the parliament. To assist the government, Labor agreed to allow these amendment bills to be introduced and debated in one sitting session and also agreed to a very tight time frame for the committee to conduct hearings and report to the Senate. However, Labor believes that the parliament should have a reasonable opportunity to scrutinise the bills and recommend appropriate amendments, if necessary. The government's objection to allow a reasonable time for the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to examine these complex bills and report to the Senate undermines the role of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues which Labor raises in the report&mdash;which have got no answers yet from the government&mdash;include the following points. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9034"> First, the application of the surcharge tax to individuals in constitutionally protected schemes rather than superannuation funds undermines the government's argument for using the complex surcharge tax collection method in the first instance. Why then is the government persisting with this complex method when it has undermined its own argument for having it in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, there was a lack of detailed responses to the questions raised by witnesses from government officials who attended the committee hearings. Unfortunately, I had to leave before we got to that section, but I am told it was a debacle. I am told that the government and the officials were not able to answer simple questions. It was a debacle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, there is evidence that, even with these amendments, the surcharge tax will not apply to defined benefit schemes because of an absence of an actuarial standard for calculating notional surcharge contributions. Fourth, there was evidence presented by ASFA that these amendment bills add to the complexity of the surcharge tax measure and will lead to further confusion within the industry and amongst those who pay the surcharge tax. This was supported by evidence from Mr Peter Downes of Jacques Martin, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the most complex and inefficient series of legislation that has been introduced into the parliament in my time of examining Commonwealth legislation since 1969.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Really. It is that bad, Senator Hogg.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifth, there was concern that many funds will not meet the 15 December deadline for reporting to the tax office because there are not enough actuaries in Australia to deal with the complex calculations needed for notional contribution factors. Sixth, several inconsistencies which exist include the application of, and payment of, the surcharge tax liability. Seventh, there was evidence from Mr Davis which was highly critical of the definition of `allocated surplus amount'. On the complex definition, he stated:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may as well be written in Russian. It is rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Eighth, there is concern that it could be a double tax on fund members. Ninth&mdash;and this is really pernicious&mdash;the inconsistent treatment of golden handshakes for surcharge purposes, depending on whether they are taken as cash or rolled over, is inequitable, has the potential to severely damage the superannuation system and is contrary to the government's retirement incomes policy. And they are not all of the problems associated with these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a mess that the government has created for itself. It is up to the government to fix it. We have provided ample opportunity to do this and would welcome a further review of this measure if the government is serious about cleaning this shambles up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to return to that question of rollovers. I draw senators' attention to Anne Lampe's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 12 November. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Treasurer announced the surcharge in the August Budget last year, he assured everyone that different treatment would be given to eligible termination payments (ETPs) that resulted from lengthy service. He said a five-year phase-in period would apply and the introduction on these payments would be staggered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, when the Contributions Tax Act was introduced last June, this principle was adopted in respect of cashed-in ETPs, but not for payments that were rolled over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been no explanations forthcoming from the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is contrary to the entire thrust of the superannuation policies being pursued, supposedly, by both the government and us. What we have set out to do is encourage people not to take the lump sums but to, in actual fact, take annuities and rollovers. That is the thrust of what we have been trying to do, yet we have set up a piece of legislation here&mdash;against the word of the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;that does the exact opposite, and that has affected many people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame. I believe the introduction of this package of superannuation surcharge bills is problematic at this time. While the bills will almost certainly pass in some form before the end of the year, the process of their passage is indicative of several serious problems. We are told these bills are urgent. Perhaps passage of them by the end of the year is essential to maintain a level of equity, but urgency is a result of management by crisis and the whole combination of ad hoc approach and bullying that has characterised this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is compelling. Obviously, having imposed a surcharge on the general public, it would be self-serving and a flagrant disregard for equity to exempt MPs and judges and other members of constitutionally protected state and federal schemes. Unfortunately, most of these schemes are exactly the schemes, the defined benefits schemes, where the legislation fails so dismally to work well or fairly. What is being applied to these people, who certainly should not be exempt from the tax, is the very worst and least workable aspect of a bad scheme. There are other outstanding issues such as the collection mechanism and the situation for those who have not given their tax file number, TFN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have these bills taken so long to draft if the same unworkable aspects which applied to the main package of bills are also used here? The major difficulties with the defined benefits schemes have not been resolved. The difficulties with the collection mechanism have not been resolved. What took so long? Why were these bills not introduced months ago? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills were introduced in the House on 2 October&mdash;about a month ago. They were introduced here on 22 October and the Senate referred the bills to a committee on 23 October. The committee has had a short hearing and presented its report on the bills prior to the reporting date of 17 November. It is now the 18th and we are debating the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nothing against haste, but I believe the situation in which complex legislation is considered with minimal time for consultation and amendment is not conducive to good legislation. I believe this is a complex area and that the time has been minimal and the pressure considerable. Given what I see in the legislation, I cannot understand why it was not introduced in the House during the last session and in the Senate early this session. I have heard this was to allow consultation and changes. Given the limited number of essential changes in these bills, I cannot see why it took so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 27th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation seems to confirm this. On page 4 there is a list of issues still of concern. Paragraph 21 says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I imagine that these might be amongst the 15 items that Senator Allison mentioned she may have included in her list to the government for answers. The government report suggested that these issues were raised and satisfied when the main surcharge tax package went through. Obviously, the government had the numbers then, but the issues were not satisfied. The appearance of virtually the same issues from the public indicates that they were not satisfied and that they are still of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental concern is that this legislation, which is touted as a mechanism to tax the rich and upper middle class, will affect people not in those classes. There are two sides to this. The first is that it will affect the people who do not have their tax file numbers listed. It is true that the Senate passed an amendment that will exempt those with less than $2,000 in contributions to superannuation. But $2,000 is less than six per cent of the September figure for the average weekly ordinary time earnings, or AWOTE, for full&hyphen;time adult workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stated intention of this bill is to catch out those on incomes of over $70,000 per year. Their compulsory employer superannuation contribution is more like $4,200. Basically, anyone from that point down to slightly below the average weekly income will be hit with this tax if the superannuation funds do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have a tax file number. In what sense is this fair or fulfilling the government's intention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is of particular concern because the number of members for whom superannuation funds have been able to get tax file numbers, as has been mentioned, is around 25 per cent. Three&hyphen;quarters of people have not given them and three&hyphen;quarters of members will be subject to potential tax. This highlights a second problem with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the problem is that superannuation funds are not set up to pay income based taxes in respect of members' incomes. It is not their normal activity and it requires a fair bit of administration. On the other hand, employers normally do pay such taxes, normally do know employee incomes and normally do have the tax file numbers. They also make the superannuation contributions and know how much they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have created a situation where superannuation funds have to take on the role of employers in terms of tax file numbers and payment of tax to the Australian Taxation Office. They need to take on the role of the members in terms of presenting and paying tax based on all income sources and take on the role of the Australian Taxation Office in terms of tracking down members and ensuring that all relevant information is submitted. That is a lot of work. There is no way the government can deny that there is a substantial compliance burden placed unnecessarily on the superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, it would be relatively easy for the employer, who knows the income the employee gets and the superannuation contribution being made on their behalf, to do a deduction and send it to the tax office along the same route as the PAYE payments. As with variables such as dependants, HECS debts and so on, a simple notification by an employee if income is over $70,000 would be enough to allow deductions to be made. It could be relatively automated as part of the pay cheque. The mechanism already substantially exists. I suppose this would be too simple for the government&mdash;the kind of government that brings back into the Senate, unnecessarily, three times, the legislation on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9037"> alcohol tax, just to satisfy Carlton and United Breweries and waste the Senate's time. No, it would be too simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would have three advantages other than administration. The first would be that the money comes out of income rather than out of savings. This increases savings and decreases consumption by those who can best afford to decrease it&mdash;those making over $70,000 in income per annum. The second is that it reduces compliance costs for superannuation funds. By reducing administration costs, it reduces costs and increases the benefits to members. This also increases savings. The third factor is that, by making the payment effectively part of PAYE, workers know whether or not they are being taxed and at what rate. There are few people making under $70,000 who would be taxed under punitive tax file number provisions without knowing it and taking action in that case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the issue of a second job arises, it is really not different from the issue that currently applies because, under PAYE, employees pay part of their income as tax, on the assumption that the rates applying on that income are the rates they should be paying. I think there are options to vary that rate, if they wish, by declaring extra income to at least one employer. On the other hand, they may wish to pay at a lower rate, knowing that they will be assessed and will have to pay the Australian Taxation Office a lump payment. This would equally apply in relation to the extra superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone making a reasonable income is obliged to fill in an accurate tax form with a tax file number anyway. It could be their responsibility to pay the additional tax if they do not declare an income of over $70,000 to an employer. It could be their responsibility to pay their assessable tax if they do not have an employer. Generally, a person making over $70,000 without an employer has an accountant and a tax agent. We are a country with a very large percentage of tax agents because we are a country with a very complex tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it would be too huge a compliance cost. In that case, if they are not making PAYE payments, in most cases they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are already somehow budgeting for tax. In other words, there are mechanisms already in place to allow the collection of this tax through standard taxation channels without imposing significant compliance costs, and without problems of targeting and taxing people who are not intended to be taxed at a higher rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason these were not used is simple: the government did not want to use standard tax channels because they wanted to preserve the pretence that it is not a tax. However, now that it is clearly stated as a tax, why can't we use the far simpler tax mechanisms already in place? This would go a long way to resolve the issue of taxing those below the threshold and reducing the burden and cost on superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember the burden and cost we put on people by trying to organise the family allowance through the Taxation Office&mdash;unnecessarily&mdash;because the government wanted it to look like something else? The same thing, in reverse, is happening in this instance. Obviously, this seems to be something of a mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be worth while getting amendments, but I believe that the government will not be accepting any Senate amendments. It is blind bull&hyphen;headedness of the sort we saw on the excise legislation recently that I mentioned in relation to the drinks tax, where the Senate amended a bill in a way consistent with the government's own committee recommendations. The government excuse for not accepting the amendments was not that something was wrong with them but that the government was treating the bill as a trivial, technical amendment, not intended to address the problem, and the whole issue could be addressed when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) comes out with Fightback mark II&mdash;I mean a comprehensive review of taxation to discover that we really need a GST and that there is only one solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that the superannuation industry will have to wear this until then, and probably afterwards, because it has nothing whatsoever to do with a GST. It is ironic that this government is causing its own unnecessary complexities and then goes to the public and says, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9038"> `We have an unduly complex tax system and we have to have a simpler one. Wouldn't that be terrific?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been highlighted by non&hyphen;government members of the committee that reviewed this issue, the government's solution to the inability to apply federal revenue measures to state government schemes is to tax the employee. It is obviously not that difficult; in many ways it is far more straightforward than the government's scheme of collection through superannuation funds. The government argument is as weak as dishwater. It is simply that it decided to do it the way it is doing it&mdash;messily and badly&mdash;and will continue to it that way&mdash;so there!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major issue here is the ongoing saga of the defined benefit schemes. On the basis of concerns presented to the committee, there seems to be no real effective measure to incorporate them into the overall superannuation treatment. These schemes are not marginal schemes, but cover very large numbers of workers in the federal and state public sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major issue is that there are up to three interacting variables in calculating what a person owes. First there is the calculation of what a person is getting as superannuation contribution. This affects their calculation of total income, which then affects the rate at which they should be taxed under the superannuation surcharge regime. This then affects the estimation of tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the calculation of notional employee contribution is off, it throws off not only the income that has been taxed but also the rate of taxation if the person is making between $70,000 and $85,000 per annum. The combination of these two rates act together to throw off the estimate of tax liability further than a change of either variable independently. So any error in calculation will be magnified, either up or down. Perhaps we will just sit and wait to see what happens to the first person who gets prosecuted for one of these errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue is how it is treated. What happens when someone pays too much? What happens when someone pays too little? Who pays whom interest, and at what rate? It is a very complicated thing and, after all, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxpayers may not be at fault if they underpay. Perhaps we will get the equivalent of Senator Newman talking about taxpayer fraud or superannuation surcharge fraud&mdash;how many people have been thrown off their superannuation for frauding the system. I can just see it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the answer may not be forthcoming for several years. In defined benefit schemes, the benefits are unknown until retirement. The resulting inaccuracies may have happened and accumulated over 15 years or more, so the issue of interest becomes important. To some extent, this is less important where it is the Commonwealth paying the Commonwealth but, outside of that scheme, other schemes are the parties liable to pay the tax. Those schemes are the ones who will either fight out the interest issue with the Australian Taxation Office, or perhaps simply dock the employee by whatever the Australian Taxation Office says, and maybe it will be the employee who ends up being diddled over time. On the other hand, in this bill we are creating a situation where members of state defined benefit schemes will pay directly. They are, therefore, the liable party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is so simple. I do not believe that it is easy to envisage how it will work and who will be ahead or behind. It is like the situation with workers in defined benefit schemes in relation to when they pay. Would they be better off leaving their money in superannuation and having the tax, with interest, removed at the end? Would they be better off paying as they go, not owing interest and not getting the benefits of leaving the money in superannuation? I do not know. I do not know if anyone has a real handle on it at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a package of bills which will go through in some form soon. It must go through if the government persists with the rest of the scheme. Personally, I think the whole thing is a monumental mistake&mdash;and that is a polite word. When we get down to it, this mess is a way to raise taxes. It is a way that was made acceptable by taxing the wealthier part of the community. It was then turned into a monumental mess through trying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9039"> to create the impression that it was not a tax. No&hyphen;one believed that, but the damage was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than putting this through as an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act and Income Tax (Rates) Act, it was put through as a special tax which was applied and collected through superannuation. As I mentioned before, it is the same attempt at hocus&hyphen;pocus used with the family tax initiative, and with the same sort of legislative, messy outcome. I guess we will be dealing with departments which have been stripped of more and more staff but which will have to deal with it and administer it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will support these bills because on the issue of whether the richer part of society ought to be paying a contribution we have already put our views on record. But we think the scheme stinks.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be confined to the Superannuation Contribution Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Bill 1997. I will direct my remarks to the definition of a constitutionally protected superannuation fund, set out in clause 37. The bill defines `constitutionally protected superannuation fund' as having:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the same meaning as constitutionally protected fund has in part IX of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I read that, I wondered why a constitutionally protected superannuation fund, having the word `superannuation' in it, should be defined as meaning `constitutionally protected fund', and why different expressions are used in this particular bill from those in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "constitutionally protected fund" means a fund that is declared by the regulations to be a constitutionally protected fund . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the regulations, there is a series of funds nominated. They relate to people such as judges. In the Income Tax Assessment Act itself, as a matter of interest, section 271A says: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite any other provision of this Part, income derived by a constitutionally protected fund is exempt from tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To follow that through, there is a shift in the words used to describe what in effect is a pension rather than a superannuation fund. For example, judges in the Victorian jurisdiction get a pension, not a superannuation allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, everybody should have superannuation. Some good schemes have been developed to see that that is done, because people should be given security as they get older. As far as judges go, they do not get superannuation; they get a pension. It is a concept that goes back centuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A pension for judges is based on the same reasoning that tenure is given to judges. Judges are given tenure and security of income. You do not necessarily have to make them wealthy, but they should have security of tenure and income both during their working life and when they retire, to ensure that they are able to act independently and to make decisions for the community without fear or favour&mdash;the same sort of thing we want from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this legislation attacks that concept of security of tenure for the sort of people that we want to help us govern the community in a way that is fair, just and according to law. I ask the minister, when he is replying at the end of this debate, to tell us why the government has taken that fairly radical position of attacking a long&hyphen;held tradition in the common law field and a strong constitutional principle that has also had a long history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of tenure was established by the Act of Settlement at the beginning of the 17th century. It has been repeated in the constitution of the United States of America, our own constitution and the Code Napoleon in France. There is a tradition of giving security to the decision makers who are going to decide the way the law is to be applied in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very interesting that that principle should, perhaps inadvertently, be attacked. Of course, judges and others should make their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9040"> contribution to the income that government needs to run the country, but I am pointing out that an interesting concept is being expressed by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept being expressed is that they do not get this pension&mdash;it is not part of the mechanism of the need to have independence and fairness established&mdash;but they are paid as everybody else within the Public Service is paid. So they are looked upon as another arm of the executive government, not an independent arm of government as they ought to be. That concept coming through in this legislation ought to cause some concern for us all. The judiciary is a third arm of government, not a department of the executive arm of government. This definition in this particular bill changes that concept around and does so, I believe, with some danger to the constitutional proprieties by which we live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very interesting to see the insertion of the word `superannuation' in the definition of the concept of the pension that people have been talking about. That word was injected into that concept. The word `superannuation' was inserted in the phrase `a constitutionally protected fund', which is clearly understood&mdash;a fund is constitutionally protected because of the need to have independence in the judiciary to ensure that they judge as they ought to judge&mdash;and that is a phrase which appears in the tax act. Why that should be done would be an interesting question for the minister to answer in his reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to add no more at this stage&mdash;I know Senator Quirke is about to deliver forth a very penetrating address. I do think that we ought to look with some care at this issue of the encroachment of the executive upon another arm of government by treating it as a department within its survey and taxing, in the way that it does, a pension which is part of that mechanism which is used by the community to ensure that we have fair decisions made for the community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get to the main focus of my address tonight, I want to make a couple of preliminary remarks about what this package of superannuation bills, in effect, is seeking to do. Firstly, it is rather interesting that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government took the view that it did in the 1996 budget that there are a number of superannuation schemes out there that are worthy of being looked at, and a number that really ought to be taxed. In fact, that is what this is&mdash;it is taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no great problem with taxation because taxation is the means by which we can deliver a number of outcomes in Australia that we need to. But one point that needs to be made about this is that the populist view that you are taxing the rich is actually not correct in this particular instance. You may well be taxing the rich at the other end of the equation, but you may not be as well. Let me explain that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What triggers this legislation now is an income of over $70,000 a year. I do not want to get into a great dissertation tonight about how good an income of $70,000 a year is. Obviously it is a fairly reasonable income. But, at the end of the day, it is not the person who is earning $70,000 that is going to be paying the tax today; it is his or her widow or widower at the other end who is going to be paying this tax, because the effect of this is going to be a reduction in the benefit further downstream. Once that pension is crystallised in five, 10, 15 or 20 years time, whatever the terms of that benefit are, that is when it is going to bite in the pocket of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that means is this: of the people who are in one of those schemes&mdash;and members of parliament are, as are a number of civil servants around the country and a number of state parliamentarians&mdash;there are a number who will go on to achieve very large incomes indeed. A number of these people will, through the pension system, achieve a pension as great as the income they are currently getting. There are a number that will not quite get that far for all sorts of reasons&mdash;they do not have government service, they do not have extra service or they have minimum parliamentary or judicial service, which means that at the end of the day the pension that will be paid to those persons, or paid to their partner through death or disability, will be considerably less than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record that there are a large number of backbenchers, even in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9041"> place, on both sides, whose widows or widowers&mdash;if those backbenchers are forced into involuntary retirement of one kind or another within the parameters of the superannuation scheme that is in effect in this place&mdash;who might have to look after children, will get, as a pension, the average male weekly wage which will now be slugged. Previously, they would have received a higher income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this is against all the ways in which taxation principles ought to apply. If it is necessary, it ought to apply at the point where the income is on or well over the $70,000. That is the equitable way in which it should apply. I would also venture the opinion that it might be an easier way to address this problem, because these bills are enormously complicated. The one thing I have found when I have gone into them is just how complicated they are. My address tonight is not to propose justice for backbenchers and all the rest of it, because I am one. At the end of the day, it is to concentrate on one particular aspect of the first bill here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was put to me about a week ago, when this proposal first surfaced around Australia for the Senate to look at, was that there was going to be specialist treatment for federal public servants, federal politicians and federal judges. I will explain how it was suggested it might work. I was told that there was a serious deficiency in section 15(6) of the first bill before our consideration tonight. I was told that the aforementioned persons&mdash;namely, those protected by various other sections of these acts, such as the Commonwealth participants&mdash;would only bear the impact of this surcharge from 20 August 1996, which I understand was budget night when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made this pronouncement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no argument with that; it is fine. The government was elected to govern, and the government got up and made those statements. I suggest that a few people opposite really ought to be looking at some of these things in more detail, but it is up to them how they want to deal with them. However, I was also told that people who are caught by this legislation in some of the other states&mdash;namely, state politicians and state public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> servants in defined benefit schemes as well as accumulation schemes&mdash;will pay before 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told by very good authorities that section 15 is so deficient that it will be retrospective not back to budget night in 1996 but to the first day that these people started work. This may sound bizarre, but I have not yet found anyone who has refuted this, and I have taken it around to a number of people. I understand that there were a few committee hearings on this before I came into this place. There were a number of individuals who said that that would be one of the outcomes of this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make this crystal clear: when it comes to the consideration in detail stage, I am going to be seeking some assurances that this is not so. This bill should be correctly drafted so that everybody in this country, at least on this level, will be treated fairly. In fact, the surcharge should start on 20 August 1996 if you are a federal politician, a state politician, a federal judge, a state judge or if you are in one of those state schemes. Certainly I know that they are in place in South Australia. I am talking about the defined benefits scheme for public servants as it was until 1985 in South Australia. At least when I was the shadow Treasurer three years ago and we had to deal with it, there were still 10,500 persons in that scheme in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has an impact on the accumulation schemes. I understand that the actuaries do not mind the accumulation schemes because you can work them out much more easily than you can a defined pension at the other end. I want to be assured&mdash;if I do not get this assurance from the minister at the end of the second reading stage, I am going to be seeking it during the consideration in detail stage&mdash;that state politicians, state judges and state public servants who have gone into a defined benefits scheme will not be liable for this surcharge before 20 August 1996. If they were liable, I have been assured that the South Australian government would proceed to constitutionally challenge this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told that during this debate tonight I can make that crystal clear. State 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9042"> treasury officials there have assured me that in no way are they going to see people under their jurisdiction treated much more adversely than here at the Commonwealth level. They have assured me that if this bill goes through as it is, with proposed section 15(6) not having the necessary protections for every person in a constitutionally protected scheme so that they will not be treated any differently from people who may sit around in here, there will be a challenge to that act to ensure that that is the outcome at the other end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the government intends to do about this. I have had a close look at proposed section 15(6). It is my view as well that those protections are not there for all persons in constitutionally protected schemes. I have no doubt, looking at the rest of the legislation, that the protections are there for us. I have no doubt that the protections are there for Commonwealth public servants. I have no doubt that the protections are there for all the people in the act who need those protections and were guaranteed them as a result of budget night 1996. But I cannot see the same mention anywhere else in the act that will protect the interests of those persons who are in constitutionally protected schemes in the states, be they in state legislatures or the state Public Service or be they members of the various police force schemes around the place. There are a number of police officers whose income triggers at $70,000 as well. There are a lot at the commissioned officer level who will be impacted by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take too much of the Senate's time tonight. I know that a couple of my other colleagues&mdash;at least one&mdash;want to join in this debate. I just want to get on the record now that I am going to be looking very closely at what the minister says when he sums all this up. If the case, as it has been put to me, is that provided you are around here you are looked after and if you are not then you are not looked after, then that is a matter we will take into the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly have been talking to some of my colleagues on this side about this and some of them will testify, too. I have talked to some of the government senators about this as well. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have indicated that in my view section 15, and in particular 15(6), needs to have explicit protections put in so that least everybody can see that the government is serious; and so that it will not in many instances retrospectively bring in these measures well before 20 August 1996. It is possible that some persons, in fact, could be taxed for the 20 or 27 years. When we get to the committee stage I will go into detail of how this affects certain people that I know who are in these schemes and what impact it will have on them when they crystallise those schemes and go onto the pension.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree fully with the sentiments put forward by my colleague, Senator Quirke. I rise in this debate this evening for a number reasons. I am primarily concerned with the effect that this legislation is going to have on a number of low income and middle income earners. I refer to an unintended consequence, obviously, of the legislation, but one which seems to be gathering momentum and getting quite away from the government. Of course, the government does not seem to be prepared to take any counsel on this issue whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me, from the evidence that we heard at the hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on 28 October, that there are substantial numbers of people who are yet to supply their tax file number. Jacques Martin&mdash;and I am not going to say they are necessarily the benchmark&mdash;gave evidence that after three attempts they had secured something like only a 23 per cent response on tax file numbers. I am aware of other industry funds which have a higher return rate but, nonetheless, there is still a substantially large number of people who have not complied, either out of ignorance or because they just do not understand the consequence of not supplying their tax file number. Of course, at some stage down the track, they will face the consequences of this legislation, which is a tax bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who will be predominantly affected? It will not be those people who have been able to rearrange their incomes or those who have been able to repackage their packages. It will be those who are invariably low and middle income earners, who are PAYE taxpayers. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9043"> Many of them will be ascribed as the battlers. They will be the people who cop the tax bill at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular I want to refer to the issue of workability, which is covered in the report of the Labor senators in the 27th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This really sums up the mess that the government is in. In the report we deal with an issue which specifically relates to defined benefit funds&mdash;that is, the taxing of the notional surchargeable contributions. This is the real problem with the defined benefits scheme. I thought the evidence of Mr Davis, in particular, before the Senate select committee was very telling of the government. A number of quotes from the evidence given by Mr Davis at that hearing really sum up the mess. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government asked the Institute of Actuaries to adopt an actuarial practice that would apply in Australia in calculating the notional surchargeable contribution . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute of Actuaries, after looking at the issue, resolved that it could not adopt an actuarial practice to apply to this, because it was too difficult to try to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is in spite of some discussion that we had with officers at the end of the hearing. It is not resolved in my view. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government actuary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and he referred specifically to the government actuary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">undeterred by that, prepared a document which gives his view of how a notional surchargeable contribution factor can be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One can only assume that as a partner in Clayton Utz and a legal person, as I understand it, Mr Davis has a fair degree of expertise in this area. Whilst there may be another expert view, the point that he has put forward is that the government actuary, undeterred by the view of the Institute of Actuaries, has put forward a view which he clearly disagrees with and, as I understand, other elements of the superannuation community also disagree with. He goes on in his evidence to say, and I am not going to read it all:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an act of parliament that will apply to funds that make up half of the assets in superannuation, and which is unworkable because there will be no actuarial practice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So his view of the legislation is that there cannot be and will not be an actuarial practice, in spite of the government actuary having taken their own view of how to levy the notional surchargeable contribution factor. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government actuary's view of how the notional contributions factor should be calculated is one actuary's view. It does not constitute actuarial practice, and no other actuary will be required to take any note of it in attempting to calculate it. An actuary, therefore, who seeks my advice on this will be told, `You can't calculate that. The act requires you to calculate it in accordance with actuarial practice. You cannot do it. If you were to attempt to do so and caused trustees to pay tax that they wouldn't otherwise have to pay, that would be negligence.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he goes on to say at the end that it is putting in place a regime that will be unworkable in relation to defined benefit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is most damning and it is something that the government have seriously got to address. They just cannot come in and impose the government actuary's view. There must be something of greater substance than that; otherwise I believe that this matter will go on completely unresolved and will end up the subject of major litigation. I think that that will be very much to the detriment of the superannuation industry. It will eat into the funds that should otherwise go towards people's retirement benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having briefly had a look at that issue, I want to take a look at another issue that came up in the hearing. Whilst one might say that it is not the subject of this piece of legislation, I believe that the government should reasonably make it part of this legislation. That is the issue of timing as addressed in the Labor senators' report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence to the committee on 28 October was that the reporting of member contributions should be put out to a date beyond 15 December. Whilst the response of the government was that the funds could seek an extension from the Australian Taxation Office, which of itself seems quite reasonable, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9044"> what I cannot understand is that this will lead to a multiplicity of such extensions being sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have duplication, surely one of the things that would be sensible and logical to do would be for the government to amend its existing legislation and put that date out beyond 15 December. The evidence to the committee clearly indicated that that was necessary. I cannot recall which group it was that gave evidence that two&hyphen;thirds of their corporate schemes use a package called Superb 2000. Apparently, the Superb 2000 software will not be modified in time to meet the 15 December deadline.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="EVANS" NAMEID="AX5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator Chris Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jacques Martin.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It was Jacques Martin. So, whilst it may be nice for some of the government departments to be in a preferred position whereby they will meet the 15 December deadline, the clear impression that was created at the hearing was that there would be at least a substantial number of extensions being sought to that 15 December reporting deadline. It just makes good ordinary commonsense for the government&mdash;not to eat humble pie, not to backtrack, but purely and simply&mdash;to extend the date of reporting. I do not think that is in any way going to disadvantage the government and its expected tax collections as a result of the surcharge measure that is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue has been addressed by my colleague who spoke before me, and that is the issue of the government needing to be consistent&mdash;consistent in the way the tax is applied. My colleague referred to some people being disadvantaged by the date of 20 August last year. It seems to me that the government must make it beyond doubt that no&hyphen;one is going to be disadvantaged or taxed differently as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard evidence that the 15 per cent cap on the surcharge tax for the members of Commonwealth schemes and constitutionally protected schemes should apply to all, and that seems reasonable. We heard that there was a definition of the 15 per cent cap applying to Commonwealth members after 20 August. If that applies to those people then I am saying that it should apply to those consti 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tutionally protected and other defined benefit schemes as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendation in the Labor senators' report related to the question of the options for payment for defined benefit schemes&mdash;that is, the rules about letting it accrue yearly or paying it as it falls due need to be applied consistently. As I understand the legislation, that will not necessarily be the case at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, I want to briefly address the issue of the allocated surplus amounts. Again, I turn to the evidence of Mr Davis. He seemed very convincing in the evidence that he put before the committee. Where there are surplus amounts in superannuation funds which are to be allocated then those will be the subject of the tax. That appears, as I understand it, to be quite unfair. As is said in our report, it will end up being a double tax. This will of course apply to accumulation funds. At page 25 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the hearing on 28 October, Mr Davis states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . accumulation funds that have never needed the services of an actuary are going to have to incur the expense of obtaining an actuarial report on what is the taxable allocated surplus amount for members of the accumulation fund.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many of those surpluses are there for the bad times and it seems to me that the double taxation of those funds is quite improper indeed. I will go on to what I believe to be the government's position in a few moments. Mr Davis in his evidence then goes on to say that there is a:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . requirement that the actuary `determine the taxable amount having regard to actuarial practice'. Of course, there is no actuarial practice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This seems to be the common fault that we are finding&mdash;that there is no actuarial practice. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It imposes a new requirement for an expense for an actuary that has never been a requirement before. It requires a calculation to be done in accordance with actuarial practice that doesn't exist, and which there is no intention of bringing into existence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having said that, the issue was raised not only by Mr Davis from Clayton Utz but also by Coopers and Lybrand. As I understand it, the government did answer the issues raised by Coopers and Lybrand at the back of the report. In respect of the issue of the definition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9045"> of an allocated surplus amount in the act and the taxing of that, at page 3 of appendix F at the back of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">27th Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation</EMPHASIS> , the response from the government is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner of Taxation, in conjunction with the Australian Government Actuary, proposes to issue a ruling outlining the circumstances in which an allocated surplus amount will arise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no such ruling at this stage. It is an unknown quantity for the superannuation industry and that is putting people on a promise. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fund will only have to seek an opinion from an eligible actuary if they come within those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst this is a response, it is a very nebulous response. It does not in any way define the circumstances. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ruling will also provide details about the calculation of the allocated surplus amounts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, when one takes that response and the evidence of Mr Davis, there is a wide gap indeed&mdash;a gap, unfortunately, which the government cannot bridge at this stage. Just on those scores alone, the government legislation is failing very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, that the government has a lot of work to do if it is going to have a piece of legislation that is understandable and workable in the first instance, let alone having any regard to how well it is either received or, most likely, not received out there in the broader world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish on a note which I think sums up the mess that the government is in with this piece of legislation. It comes again from Mr Peter Downes, Manager Government Business, Jacques Martin, when he was before the Senate select committee on 28 October. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment we have some 20 centimetres of 12 acts and regulations, explanatory material, second reading speeches. It is an incredible body of legislation and it is extremely complex. It is the most complex and inefficient series of legislation that has been introduced into the parliament in my time of examining Commonwealth legislation since 1969.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that really sums it up, really gets to the heart of the problem. The fact is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government started down the road of a surcharge. It has now come to a screaming halt in terms of the defined benefit schemes. The industry, of course, are asking the government to stop, hold everything, look at it with the industry and come up with a sensible result so that, at the end of the day, even though they might not like it, at least there will be something that is workable, something that is understandable for them. But, left in its current form, it is an absolute mess, and the government needs to take a very close look at this piece of legislation before we get into the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to make a contribution to the debate on this package of superannuation bills which seek to complement and extend the existing legislation that provides for a contribution tax on high income earners. I do not wish to traverse all the ground that my colleagues have because senators, like Senator Hogg, have done a good job of reflecting the concern within the industry and within the community at the shambles that has become the superannuation contributions tax for high income earners. It is an issue that the government really must address seriously rather than try to bulldoze its way through, as it is currently trying to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government continues to repeat the mantra that this is fair legislation, that the opposition is merely from vested interest groups and that it will all be okay. I am sure the officers who have had to live with this for over a year now will testify that there are genuine and serious concerns with the government's approach on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obviously the case that like a good political idea&mdash;a 15 per cent surcharge, as the government liked to call it&mdash;it is now legislatively called a tax on high income earners in the context of the budget. It was something that they thought that both the community and the opposition parties would have difficulty in opposing because, since the days of Robin Hood, taxing the rich has been a popular sort of cry and it has immediate and on face value appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that somebody then got the job of trying to implement what was a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9046"> simple idea, and it has not proved to be simple to implement and it has not been capable of being implemented in a fair and equitable manner. I do not want to labour the politics of this. We have been uphill and down dale over this for some time now. It is important though that the government try to come to terms with fixing the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition parties are in an unenviable position. Our problem with these bills is that we are confronted with a situation where these bills seek to extend the contributions tax for high income earners to those funds that were not covered by the first set of bills. So, in equity terms, one is inclined to say that one ought to support the extension of the contributions tax to those funds so that all high income earners with superannuation are taxed at the same rate and are caught by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with that is that we are also being asked to extend what is clearly bad, inappropriate, imprecise, complex and expensive legislation to a whole new range of people. So you are caught between the desire to treat everyone equitably and the prospect of extending, even further, legislation that is clearly bad legislation. I guess that is something we in the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens will have to grapple with. I know the Democrats in the Senate select committee report recommended that the government look to go back to industry and consult again. The Labor Party has also advised that we really take a serious look at alternative mechanisms to make sure we can do it better. I do not think it is beyond the wit of the superannuation industry and the government to do it better. Certainly, a range of submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation suggested alternative approaches which meet the government's policy and revenue goals but which provide a much more efficient, fair and less complex collection mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I do not want to labour the politics but it does seem to me that the government should seriously reconsider its position in relation to this matter. They will have to reconsider it down the track in any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> event when the difficulties with the legislation continue to emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the earlier bills having been passed some time ago now, the industry continued to express serious concerns and disquiet about the legislation. During the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into this package of bills, the government expressed the view that it was the same old critics continuing to harp on. What that reflects is that the industry's view was not merely a political one&mdash;as the minister tries to paint it&mdash;but that there are serious and deep-seated concerns and criticisms and those concerns and criticisms continue. Nothing in the experience since the passage of the first set of bills has allayed those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of those matters were raised with the committee again in this inquiry into this package of bills and they go to questions, including as my colleagues have said, the difficulty of tax file number collection. A witness from Jacques Martin indicated that, despite two or three attempts to collect tax file numbers, they still had only a 23 per cent success rate. Even if theirs is a peculiar experience and not reflective of the general industry and other schemes do better&mdash;whatever caveats you want to put on it&mdash;the reality is that that means, on anyone's assessment, a significant number of low and middle income earners will not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund. That means this will not be a tax on the rich; it will be a tax on those persons who fail to provide their tax file number. It is not, as the government says, a tax on the rich. It will be a tax on ordinary wage and salary earners on a low or middle income within Australia. So one of the principal arguments for this set of bills is defeated by the fact it is not confined to the target group as the government claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor senators and the Democrats senator, Senator Allison, dealt with a lot of these concerns in the committee's report. I do not wish to canvass them all tonight but I do have particular concerns about the treatment of allocated surplus amounts. It appears to me from the evidence we heard that the impact of the government's current legislation is to double tax those allocated surplus amounts. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9047"> Those funds play an important part in evening out the returns paid to superannuation fund members. They are an important mechanism for ensuring that superannuation fund members about to retire are protected from the vagaries of sharp movements in the market from time to time. Anything that seeks to penalise those funds that operate allocated surplus amounts should be of concern to this parliament and the government. I think the government ought to have another look at the proposed tax treatment of those surplus amounts. I am not assured by the government's evidence and I certainly will be pursuing the minister in the committee stages on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I wanted to raise briefly was the impact of this legislation on golden handshakes. It seems to provide a taxation advantage to those people who take a superannuation payment in cash rather than roll it over. Given the history of the development of superannuation in this country, any measure which effectively favours in the tax treatment cashing out superannuation rather than rolling it over is a retrograde step and is not consistent even with the government's own stated objectives and principles in relation to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are a range of issues like that which are covered in the report but which I do not want to labour now. A lot of the issues stem from the basic internal inconsistencies in the government's approach. We now have some funds being taxed whereas in other funds we are seeking to tax the member. The whole thing has become such a shemozzle that very few people in this country understand it. Certainly, the average member of a superannuation fund will have no chance of understanding the principles at stake, how things operate or whether they are being treated fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a senator who has served on this committee for a number of years now, I find each time I come to the issue I have to go over the reading to try to re&hyphen;acquaint myself with the issue to get a grip on some of the complex issues that are involved. Some would say that I do not do that very well, and I am prepared to accept that criticism because you would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to be a practitioner dealing with it daily to get your head around some of the issues. I think that is a problem in terms of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the industry is so disquieted by this taxation measure really ought to be taken much more seriously than it seems to have been taken by the minister, Senator Kemp. It is not acceptable to denigrate those who criticise. One has to answer and counter their criticisms. To be brutally frank, I do not think that has been done. We will be insisting that it is done in the committee stage because I think people deserve answers to the very serious criticisms that have been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To highlight those, as you probably would have expected, I want to raise the issue of the letter received by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation from the Institute of Actuaries of Australia on 14 November. That letter seeks to provide the committee with information regarding its report and the taxation on contributions. They claim that the committee `has not been provided with the correct facts regarding several very important issues'. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our concerns are addressed below and we urge you to bring them to the attention of the other senators prior to debating these bills in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of their central concerns is the evidence given by the Australian tax office to the effect that an `instruction has been given to the Institute of Actuaries to ensure that there would be a 15 per cent cap on the surcharge liability; in particular, that the Actuary's calculation of the notional surcharge contribution factor would ensure that nobody pays more than 15 per cent'. The Institute of Actuaries absolutely deny this. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no provision for a 15% cap in the calculation methodology set out in this ruling and in fact, it is inevitable that the application of this Ruling to defined benefit schemes will result in individual cases occurring from time to time where a member's surcharge liability will exceed the 15% limit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Institute of Actuaries are saying that the evidence given to the committee by the tax office is bunkum. We have not been convinced by the tax office's evidence to us and are inclined to support the view confirmed in the Institute of Actuaries letter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9048">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to Senator Kemp confirming that the government's policy was that the 15 per cent cap was an absolutely clear and unequivocal intention of the government, the Institute of Actuaries said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may be the intent of the government, but it can not be achieved with the current legislation as it applies to defined benefit funds as well as certain accumulation funds, particularly where there is a vesting scale. We can clearly demonstrate this problem to you, should you require more information.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The concerns not only of the industry but also of the Institute of Actuaries continue. They do not believe the government. They do not accept the evidence of the government that members will be protected from having any more than 15 per cent tax paid on their contributions. So the government's policy is in tatters because the 15 per cent tax will be applied not only on lower and middle income earners who fail to provide their tax file numbers but higher income earners. Indeed, anybody who fails to provide their tax file number is liable to pay more than 15 per cent tax on their contributions in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So none of the guarantees the government continues to offer are achievable. None of them, according to industry or the Institute of Actuaries, are correct. We are asked to take the government on trust and accept that everybody else is wrong. As I say, the evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation convinced me and convinced the other Labor and Democrat senators that there are still very serious problems with this tax on contributions, that the government's case had not been made out, that the government are only providing rhetoric in answer to serious concerns raised by industry groups and by the Institute of Actuaries, and that they really have an obligation to provide a much more compelling case if they expect this legislation to be carried by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the evidence that has been presented so far, no reasonable person, no uninterested third party, could accept the government's view. They have not produced the goods. As I say, I do not know that the Institute of Actuaries are known as a particularly left&hyphen;wing group or as a radical group or as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> group that is prone to exaggeration. I think they have taken a very considered and sober look at the legislation, and in their view the government do not meet the claims that they make for the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government really have to have a serious look at this and accept that what looked like a politically smart move at the time has turned out to be a very poor move in terms of good policy and good legislation. They ought to reconsider their whole approach to the tax on high income earners' contributions to superannuation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to celebrate the achievements of the Forest Protection Society. This Friday, this dynamic community organisation will celebrate its 10th anniversary. From humble beginnings born out of frustration at government policies that were destroying small timber communities and their families, an organisation that now boasts 12,000 members and 55 branches across our country was launched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I acknowledge the current leaders and coordinators of the Forest Protection Society who, I note, are present in the gallery. In particular, I acknowledge: Chris Althaus, the National Director; Heike Phillips, the National Coordinator; and a number of the state coordinators from right around Australia. Let me also place on record my proud membership of the Forest Protection Society.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9049">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the Forest Protection Society has been to gain secure long&hyphen;term access to natural resources to generate employment and a future for regional communities and to ensure that our unique Australian forests are scientifically evaluated and sustainably managed for the benefit of future generations and genetic diversity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seeks to encourage the sensible, balanced multiple use of our forests for the benefit of all Australians. In short, it supports productive conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forest Protection Society is a truly community based organisation and has pursued the interests of its members and communities with great vigour and success. For too long, the hardworking regional communities were sidelined and ignored by the powers that be&mdash;namely, the federal and state governments. The armchair conservationists, blissfully ignorant of the real issues, ran campaigns which misled the well&hyphen;meaning and prejudiced the future of our fellow Australians in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using chemically treated glossy paper, the extreme Greens peddled their propaganda with its emotive language, whilst those who lived in harmony with the forests producing jobs, infrastructure and a truly renewable resource were ignored by virtue of a lack of an organised voice.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, the righteous indignation of one logger's wife got too much for her, and the Forest Protection Society came into being. I pay tribute to Robyn Bain's pioneering role in its formation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, the Forest Protection Society has been at the cutting edge of the environment debate throughout Australia. They provide information booths at agricultural shows, educational kits, inspection tours and also an active, sincere voice in what was previously an uncoordinated and marginalised yet very important valuable and productive group within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The educational value of the Forest Protection Society has seen the public become more educated about the facts, and it has seen the extreme Greens lose considerable ground. Indeed, in my own home state of Tasmania the results are obvious. In the late 1980s the Greens gained their zenith of 17.13 per cent of the popular vote. Now, as we get towards 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the end of the 1990s, they have plummeted to 11 per cent. In the 1980s they had hundreds to their rallies, sometimes thousands. Now they are lucky if they can round up 100 for the signing of the regional forest agreement in Tasmania. This decline can be attributed to the general society being better educated about forestry. Dissemination of facts has been vital and very successful, and I pay tribute to the role of the Forest Protection Society in achieving those results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Forest Protection Society has done is to place on the record and in the public arena the true facts about our forest industry. Timber is from a natural and renewable resource, competing&mdash;might I add&mdash;with non&hyphen;renewable commodities like steel, aluminium and plastics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native forests are logged for the purpose of providing sawn timber for housing, furniture and for use in the construction industry. The waste from sawmilling is then either converted into woodchips or burnt and wasted at sawmills. Similarly, in the forests, trees from the harvest area unsuitable for sawmilling are either chipped or left to burn or rot. If woodchipping were to stop, sawmills would still need the same number of trees to be logged. The only difference is that the by&hyphen;product would be wasted rather than turned into books and paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say for the chuckling Democrats that the federal government's Resource Assessment Commission determined with its exhaustive study into Australia's forests&mdash;1989 to 1992&mdash;that there is no evidence that any plant or animal species has been threatened with extinction because of forestry activities. Given that state forests have been logged for more than 100 years, this is sound evidence of the resilience of our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of other facts, but the time is running short. The new woodchip regulations which allow for the productive use of our forest waste and the regional forest agreements already signed in the Gippsland area and in my home state of Tasmania are important achievements which have provided jobs and export earnings in an environmentally friendly way. These have been achieved with overwhelming community support, and we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9050"> seeing the pendulum swing back to sensible, scientifically based sustainable harvesting of our resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forest Protection Society has been at the forefront of achieving this balance and putting commonsense back into the debate about our timber industry. And balance and commonsense were desperately needed. At last count it appeared that there were some 400 experts working on the policy on behalf of the trees and just two assigned to cover the impact of industry closures on people and communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Robyn Bain would say, `I don't think it too outrageous to ask that people be given the same consideration as trees.' That such a statement was made&mdash;and, indeed, had to be made&mdash;is a very sad indictment of the state of the debate concerning the harvesting of our renewable timber resources. It is particularly regrettable when considered in the light of our $2 billion per annum trade deficit in wood products, which sees the importation of wood products from areas around the world which do not have such vigorous forestry guidelines as exist in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forest Protection Society network across this country also provides a great degree of civic&hyphen;minded and motivated activity in supporting each other and developing community facilities and making representations for, and on behalf of, their communities in a whole range of areas. In short, the Forest Protection Society has been a welcome addition to Australia's patchwork quilt of community organisations. Its contributions through its members and sizeable network of branches to the forestry conservation debate in this country have been refreshing. Its genuine grassroots and spontaneous growth have really stamped the Forest Protection Society as the organisation of the decade of its life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the Forest Protection Society well and wish it many happy returns and ongoing success in its vital campaign in informing our fellow Australians about the facts of our vibrant and environmentally friendly forest industry. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="9050" TIME="10.09 p.m." SPEAKER="Allison, Sen Lyn" NAMEID="1M6" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to report on my visit on Sunday to Breamlea, which is a coastal township 20 minutes from Geelong. I was invited to Breamlea to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Breamlea wind generator and to press a switch to restart that generator. The community group which now owns and operates this generator is the Alternative Technology Association. This is a group which has been actively promoting sustainable technologies for more than 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, with funds donated by its members, it saved the wind generator at Breamlea from being dismantled and removed at the time the Victorian state government sold the State Electricity Commission. Like the Howard government, the Kennett government does not regard greenhouse emissions and global warming as issues which warrant action. The Victorian coalition government inherited 10 experimental wind generators from the previous Labor government. When the coalition government privatised electricity in Victoria, it decided to scrap the lot, in spite of the fact that eight out of the 10 proved to be sited where wind conditions would have made them viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years ago this remarkable and committed community group put in a successful bid for the generator. They repaired the damaged components and got the wind generator restarted. It began feeding power back into the power grid in January 1995. They continue to provide monthly maintenance work on this generator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Westwind generator was built in Australia, and it is similar to those used in Europe and the United States. When wind speeds exceed four metres per second, the microprocessor&hyphen;based control system connects the machine to the local power grid. The average wind speed at Breamlea is 6.3 metres per second. This single 60&hyphen;kilowatt wind generator works day and night to generate non-polluting greenhouse gas free electricity for Melbourne consumers. So far it has produced 680 megawatt hours of electrical energy, which goes straight into the Victorian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9051"> grid. This generator alone has already saved the emission of 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which would otherwise have been produced in the Latrobe Valley. Over two million kilograms of CO2 emissions will be saved over the 15 remaining years of the life of this generator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CityPower, the new owners of Melbourne's electricity supply business, has had a very important role in supporting this wind generator at Breamlea, and for that I congratulate them. The problem that many producers of clean energy face is in finding a buyer. Once again, it is fortunate for Victorians that CityPower has had the foresight to do just that. They have done it even though Breamlea is, in fact, outside the distribution region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arrangements like this are supposed to be very straightforward through the national electricity market. This new model of an electricity industry broken up into producers, numerous distributors and systems, which now cross state borders, was hailed as a breakthrough in competition which would drive the cost of electricity down and open the way for alternative energy generators to feed into the grid. In fact, it has been very difficult for small producers like Breamlea to sell power to anyone other than their local power distribution company. Surprise, surprise!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This small volunteer group took an enormous gamble. At the time they considered making the bid, there was no guarantee that they would be able to sell their power. In the event of a blade failure, they might be up for $30,000 for a replacement set. They did not even know whether they would be able to continue to lease the land on which the generator was sited. Eventually, a small group of investors got together and put up the funds and, with the commitment and the support of the members of the Alternative Technology Association, the Breamlea wind generator was restarted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small producers like the Breamlea Operations Group are effectively excluded from the open market in which large producers and distributors buy and sell their power, and they are generally stuck with whatever price the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> local distributor chooses to pay; that is, of course, if they choose to purchase at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is way behind other countries in its commitment to wind power, particularly North America and Europe. Quite recently, President Clinton guaranteed that one million homes in the States will be powered by alternative energy over the next few years. Australia, on the other hand, has only one significant wind farm, and that is in Esperance in Western Australia. This farm has two megawatts of Vesta machines connected to a 14&hyphen;megawatt diesel power station. In 1993, a 10&hyphen;megawatt wind farm proposed by a private consortium on the Victorian coastline was shelved when negotiations on purchasing arrangements broke down with the Victorian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission is well advanced in its plans for a 700&hyphen;kilowatt wind farm on King Island in Bass Strait. Pacific Power in Sydney owns and operates a 150&hyphen;kilowatt wind turbine. There are plans afoot for a 66&hyphen;turbine wind farm near Mount Gambier in South Australia, which is due to commence operations in December next year. But that is about it. In spite of the fact that polls have shown that, given the choice, people would even be prepared to pay a little more for clean, renewable energy, conservative governments in this country in particular have shown enormous reluctance to take the lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Consumers Association recently released the results of a survey it did in July this year on greenhouse. The association found that, whilst only 67 per cent of 1,500 respondents actually understood what the greenhouse effect is, 70 per cent felt that it is extremely important and must be dealt with immediately. Seventy&hyphen;nine per cent felt that they were able to personally make some difference in reducing Australia's greenhouse gases. Over 75 per cent said that they were interested in getting solar energy in their homes. More than half of those surveyed said that they were willing to pay a tax on their petrol to help find ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, less than 10 per cent of Australian households have solar powered hot water 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9052"> systems. This suggests that it is just too difficult or too expensive for people to take that initial step. That is why governments need to take a leading and visionary role in alternative energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' greenhouse package released this month has some very simple, practical and realistic ways of achieving real commitments to greenhouse gas reductions. For instance, we say that there should be a condition on electricity utilities licences and access to the national grid to see that they work towards improved performance standards. Low interest loans should be offered to help utilities phase out older, heavy polluting power stations and replace them with natural gas in the short term, and renewable technologies in the medium to long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Natural gas should be seen as a bridging fuel. Movements to researching, improving and utilising renewable energies must be a top priority. Consumers should be given the option of sourcing their energy supply from renewable sources. Funding of commercial development of renewable energies such as solar, wind, ethanol and other biomass should not only be restored to its pre&hyphen;1996 levels but be expanded significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to see a household energy efficiency trust set up to offer interest free loans to encourage households to switch to solar heating and improve insulation. This could be funded by a grant of $200 million a year by drawing on the diesel fuel subsidy for the mining industry. The loans could be repaid over six to eight years, making the trust self&hyphen;funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just a couple of the suggestions from our package. I urge the government to take a closer look at this paper and at the excellent work being done out in the community to help turn around our appalling record on greenhouse gas emissions. It can be done. It does not cost jobs. All it needs is some leadership and commitment by a government to get it right.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9052"><TITLE>Logging and Woodchipping</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on another matter that is of great concern to the Demo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crats, an issue that has environmental implications as well as economic implications in my own state of Queensland and an issue that was reported on to some extent today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> &mdash;that is, what is labelled as a catastrophe in the Daintree area in Far North Queensland. That catastrophe relates to the clear-felling of rainforests, the draining of wetlands and the destruction of the tourist values that have made that region famous. A collective of Daintree tourist operators is so concerned about land clearing that it has published advertisements in local newspapers to express its outrage at this destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lowland rainforest is critical habitat for cassowaries and tree kangaroos. It is being cleared basically just to make way for further grazing. The Daintree area is pretty well known to a lot of people by name at least. It was listed as part of the northern section of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area in 1988. It was listed primarily for its superlative natural values. The rainforest there is incredibly old and represents some major stages in our evolutionary and biological history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could reel off a number of percentages of plants, bird species, reptiles, et cetera that are found in that area and in that area only. Rather than do that, it is probably easier to just say that it is a spectacular area. I would very much recommend to anyone who has not been up there that they do go up there because it is just a magnificent piece of this planet. It is a magnificent experience for anybody who does have the privilege to go to that area. Given the threat that is being posed to that area at the moment, it is even more important than ever that people get up there before it disappears forever. That certainly seems to be a danger that is being presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, which has done so much in the far north of Queensland to bring attention to the threats to the environment in that part of the world, has been desperately trying to make clear to people how much threat is being posed by the current level of clearing that is occurring in the Daintree region. Lots of people, including me up until a few years ago, assume that, given how wonderful this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9053"> area is and the fact that it has got world heritage status, it would be protected&mdash;`How could anybody think that that sort of area could be at risk of being clear&hyphen;felled by people just wanting to basically run a few cattle across the place?' But, unfortunately, that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the coordinator of the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre said recently, there is a widespread misconception among Australians that the rainforests of the Daintree are protected from land clearing and inappropriate development. In fact, almost all of the lowland coastal rainforest habitat in the Daintree is neither national park nor world heritage areas. The current protected area is hopelessly inadequate in terms of being able to protect the Daintree's world famous natural values. I think it is absolutely crucial that we do all we can to make sure that those values are protected before it is too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the attempts to protect that area occurred through the Daintree rescue package&mdash;something that the Democrats advocated very strongly for back in the earlier part of this decade. We were very glad to see some money provided by the Commonwealth and state governments back in 1994 to buy back some freehold blocks of land to prevent some large-scale residential and tourist development and the land clearing that occurs as part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That money is almost all used up now, unfortunately, but the vision to buy back the Daintree area for the people of Queensland, the people of Australia as a whole and, indeed, for the people of the planet and for future generations, is yet to be fulfilled. Throughout the far north of the state, people are strongly advocating that that vision be completed and extra funds be provided to finish the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the funds that have been provided to date risk being wasted if areas are bought back, but in insufficient amounts to enable the ecological values of that area to be preserved. If wide scale clearing and development occurs around it, then the environmental and economic values of that area will be at risk. Certainly, the tourism potential of that area is clear for anybody to see who wishes to look.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is crucial that we protect this land from land clearing by ensuring that adequate land clearing laws exist which are enforced, as well as by buying the land in that area to protect it from the things that can happen when it is freehold title. It is that issue of ensuring that land clearing laws are enforced that is crucial to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a fair bit of pain and agony, the local Douglas Shire Council has finally introduced some land clearing laws for that area but, unfortunately, the council does not appear to have the will to enforce those laws. The Mayor of Douglas Shire Council, Mike Berwick, who has been a great defender and supporter of preserving what makes that part of the world so special, has been having a lot of trouble convincing his own council to enforce those laws. That is a great tragedy, not just for the people of that area but for the people of Queensland and the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area is under threat not just from land clearing, but also from the Queensland government's plan to connect the electricity grid to properties north of the Daintree River. The Democrats have spoken on that many times in the past in this chamber, and more than a year ago my colleague Senator Woodley from Queensland brought to the Senate's attention the threat that is posed there. Unfortunately, the threat from the Queensland government is still there and is stronger than ever. It appears that the federal government is willing to let that happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 500 freehold landowners in the area have offered their properties for sale to the government as part of trying to encourage buying back in that area for future generations, but only 80 have been purchased, according to a spokesperson from the Daintree Rainforest Task Force. Of the $14 million allocated to buy back private land in that area, only a very small amount is left, as I said earlier. We have well over 400 property owners willing to sell their properties, but at the moment the money simply is not there for the Daintree Planning Coordination Group or the Wet Tropics Management Authority to spend. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9054">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats wish to point out to the federal government, as well as to the Queensland government, that this is a crucial issue, and it is at flashpoint at this very moment. If nothing is done in the near future to address this problem&mdash;both in terms of the ongoing land clearing that is being done in contravention of the land clearing laws that have been introduced by the local government, and in terms of the Queensland government's plan to introduce the connection of the mains electricity grid to the area north of the Daintree, with the likely impacts of massive population increases, infrastructure development and the probability of resort developments occurring in that area&mdash;then the values that make the Daintree so special and enable it to be listed as a world heritage area will be lost to the people of Queensland. That is a matter of grave concern to me and to the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for action on this issue and it needs to happen very quickly. Rather than see the magnificent Daintree area suffer death by a thousand cuts, the Democrats call on the federal and Queensland governments to act now before it is too late. It certainly will hang over the heads of the coalition governments at both federal and state level if they do not act now while the chance is there to preserve this marvellous area for future generations.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.27 p.m." PAGE="9054"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.27 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(l) (a) Yes. The Coalition policy on Defence stated "The Defence Housing Authority will give special attention to housing in isolated areas and the standard of accommodation for on-base single personnel." The standard of accommodation for on-base personnel has been rigorously reviewed and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9060"> in 1996 a comprehensive survey of living in accommodation was undertaken across Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The function of DHA is to provide housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of the Department of Defence.
