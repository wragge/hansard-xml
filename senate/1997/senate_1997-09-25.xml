<PETITION PAGE="6929" TOTAL.SIGNED="95" PRESENTERS="Ray, Sen Robert" NAMEIDS="UI4"><TITLE>Repatriation Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6930"> in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME><FROM>(from 95 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of Senate assembled:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 25 June 1997 (your ref cttee/101/97) regarding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No. 96 and to your notice of motion on 25 June 1997 in the Senate regarding these Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset I wish to say that it was never the intention of the Government or the Marine Park Authority to have the onus of proof in these Regulations reversed and that is the reason no references are made to that issue in the Explanatory Statement.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the last election, the Coalition stated that the "Coalition regards personal privacy as a cherished right in a free society" (On&hyphen;line Policy Statement, Coalition Election Papers, 1996) and that the Government would "work with industry and the States to provide a co&hyphen;regulatory approach to privacy within the private sector in Australia, comparable with best international practice" (Law and Justice Policy Statement, Coalition Election Papers, 1996). This commitment seemed to be in place when the Attorney General launched a Discussion Paper on 12 September 1996 saying "Privacy protection will be enhanced for all Australians with the extension of the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act) to the private sector. . . I intend to be in a position to develop legislation for introduction next year" (Attorney General and Justice Minister, Press Release 142, 12 September 1996).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Discussion Paper released by the Attorney General set out a scheme based on the existing Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 and met many of the concerns of consumers. In essence this was a proposal for industry codes of practice supervised by the Privacy Commissioner and subject to statutory backing&mdash;a co&hyphen;regulatory approach. This scheme would have been consistent with the schemes adopted by New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, on 21 March 1997, the Prime Minister did a "backflip". He stated: "I took the opportunity of today's Premiers Conference to raise the Commonwealth's concern's regarding proposals to implement a privacy regime for the private sector. . . The Commonwealth will not be implementing privacy legislation for the private sector" (Prime Minister, Press Release, 21 March 1997). That was it. . . the end of Australia's international best practice privacy scheme and another election promise broken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privacy protection needs to extend to the collection, storage, security, access, correction, use, destruction and disclosure of all personal information. The present legislative scheme set out in the Privacy Act 1988 addresses the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information held by the Commonwealth Government. This scheme also extends to credit reporting, some telecommunications suppliers and operators and a limited number of other circumstances. This scheme does not otherwise extend to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats believe personal information should be protected through a comprehen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6936"> sive national legislative scheme. This should be a strong, enforceable privacy protection which covers both the public and the private sectors with powers vested in an independent body to investigate and enforce its decisions based on clear principles of what constitutes a breach. The proposed amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 set out in the Privacy Amendment Bill 1997 (the Bill) will address this intention in a scheme where industry is either covered by legislated privacy principles or develops its own codes of practice with the co&hyphen;operation of the Privacy Commissioner and subject to approval by the Parliament. The privacy principles and codes of practice maintain a comprehensive and enforceable privacy protection with powers conferred on the Privacy Commissioner which are similar to those presently set out in the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill extends the definition of "agency" to include all persons (including unincorporated bodies) who would be covered by the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in particular Article 17 of that Covenant, corporations and trading corporations and financial corporations. However, acts or practices which are done for personal or family reasons, household affairs or journalistic, literary or artistic purposes are not covered. Other amendments are made which are directed at including codes of practice into the operation of the act in its present structure and application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Information Privacy Principles are added which cover areas of justifiable purpose, limiting the retention of information, maintaining anonymity and unique identifiers. In the absence of codes of practice these principles will apply to all agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an identified grouping generally, a specified person, a specified class of persons, a specified agency, industry, profession or calling or a specific act or practice has been identified either by the Privacy Commissioner or at the request of that class, the Privacy Commissioner may issue a code of practice. Before this code of practice is issued there must be reasonable efforts to inform affected classes and accept their submissions. The code of practice comes into operation following a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. A code of practice may override the operation of the Information Privacy Principles or specify how that principle is to apply to that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will also expand the functions of the Privacy Commissioner to enable the Commissioner to make public statements about privacy. This additional function is appropriate as it will allow the Privacy Commissioner to undertake community education campaigns on privacy issues and prepare materials that relate to public interest matters. The Privacy Commissioner will also be able to promote the protection of individual privacy.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Prime Minister performed his "backflip" on 21 March 1997 he said he was meeting the concerns of business: "The Commonwealth opposes such proposals which will further increase compliance costs for all Australian businesses, large and small. . . At a time when all heads of government acknowledge the need to reduce the regulatory burden, proposals for new compulsory regimes would be counterproductive" (Prime Minister, Press Release, 21 March 1997). It is uncertain whether the business sector generally agrees with the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quantitative research in Australia is very limited. However, Price Waterhouse surveyed 130 large businesses earlier this year and found 70 per cent favoured, 10 per cent were `neutral' and 20 per cent opposed the introduction of comprehensive national privacy laws. The survey report concluded: ". . . Australian business has identified privacy as a major business risk and they are looking to the Australian Government for guidance on how to manage it" (Privacy Survey 1997, Price Waterhouse, 215 Spring Street, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000). This survey confirms an earlier survey conducted by the Faculty of Business and Economics at Monash University which found businesses recognise the importance of personal information to their clients and employees (Boykett, J., O'Reilly, H. and Tucker, G., Private sector attitudes to information privacy, 1996, 3 PLPR 101). The Prime Minister's statement is also at odds with the major industrialised countries which have recognised the economic and social benefits of privacy protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of Commonwealth legislation, the States and Territories are considering filling the void. New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are presently examining privacy legislation options. If State and Territory governments do introduce privacy schemes, businesses will be required to comply with each of those schemes which may be different for each State and Territory, therefore increasing overall compliance costs and regulatory burdens significantly. The Prime Minister's statements about compliance costs and regulatory burdens are hollow in light of these State and Territory responses, and highlights the need for a national and consistent privacy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial meeting of G7 industrialised countries in February 1995 and APEC Ministers in May 1995 identified privacy as an issue which was important for commercial reasons. The European Union has adopted a legally enforceable law in the form of the Privacy Directive and New Zealand has implemented the Privacy Act 1993, which creates a comprehensive national privacy scheme applying to both the public and private sectors. The Euro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6937"> pean Union Privacy Directive which comes into force on 1 July 1998 will prevent trade with Australia (and any other country) if there are not adequate privacy laws to protect personal information. The Government's Discussion Paper set out a scheme which was consistent with these international developments and international standards and would have met the concerns of the European Union Privacy Directive and our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fundamental principle that a person has a right to know what personal information is held about them, and if the information is lawfully held, that the information is correct. The International Charter of Civil and Political Rights Article 17 provides that "no one shall be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his [or her] privacy". The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 12 provides that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his [or her] privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor attacks upon his [or her] honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks". Privacy is a human rights issue and the Government should deal with the issue as a part of Australia's international human rights obligations. These are fundamental human rights set out in Agreements to which Australia has attested and the domestic laws should reflect these international commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is essential to keep pace with the developments in other countries and the advances in information collection and exchange technology. The developing technology industries and consumers are likely to benefit from such a scheme, through continued access to world trade and the confidence of consumers that their personal information is adequately protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the morning of 4 September a most extraordinary thing happened in this chamber. Most honourable senators were absolutely unaware of what occurred. What occurred was something I have never seen occur in all the time that I have been in this place. A report by a standing committee of the Senate was brought into this chamber at around 9.43 and 52 seconds. It was tabled in the parliament, the Presiding Officer ordered that it be printed and, at 9.44, seconds later, a motion was carried that the Senate adopt the committee's recommendation to note the government's decision and agree to the transfer of responsibility for the administration of senators' travelling allowances from the Department of the Senate to the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By that motion we were asked to adopt the recommendation in the report which was in the hands of only a very select few in the Senate, namely, the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. They are select members, they do a good job for us, but none of the rest of us had an inkling of what was contained in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report; yet at that stage we were supposed to vote on the recommendation. Of course, there was a short debate. I must say that I was caught short. I did not know the vote was going to take place. When I did find out I assumed that the normal thing would be for the matter to be adjourned. I actually came down and, when I rushed into the chamber, it was all over bar the shouting&mdash;everything had finished. I was rather concerned, but not only for myself; I believe other honourable senators who have subsequently found out what occurred are also concerned as to what occurred procedurally on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, as I indicated to you in my letter to  you of 5 September, I am sure that, had you been aware of these facts, you would have made sure that the matter was not finalised until senators had the opportunity of receiving and studying the report. I do not want to ask senators to indicate how many had the report, but I would say only three of the honourable senators who are currently in this chamber had the report. Almost none of those who are not currently in this chamber had the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the extraordinary thing that happened. I believe, Madam President, that something needs to be done on your initiative to ensure that that does not occur again. To order the report to be printed&mdash;and, by definition, I assume that means that people have not got the report&mdash;and then, seconds later, have a motion for the adoption of the recommendation in the report is a nonsense. But I will not belabour that point&mdash;I think it was probably just an oversight. We will just have to live with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Senate for giving us the opportunity to reconsider the merits or otherwise of the recommendation that we are being asked to adopt. The recommendation that we are being asked to adopt is one which I believe is flawed, in that it blurs the distinction between the executive government and the parliament. We are being asked to have the travelling allowances of the members of the Senate dealt with by an arm of the executive government. I do not believe that that is proper, given the principle of separation of powers. I know that some of the other entitle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6939"> ments are dealt with by an arm of the executive government&mdash;that is another question&mdash;but this is an extension of that particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I object to it not only on that ground but also on the ground of efficiency. The Department of the Senate has, as we all know, an audit proceeding at the present moment&mdash;it is being done by an independent auditor&mdash;of all our travel allowances. I can tell you from experience that they are going through it with a very fine toothcomb indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is data matching available. I think I gave you the example the other day of where I had been picked up for claiming travelling allowance for Canberra when I was not in Canberra. It was a Tuesday night in late April of last year. For the life of me, I could not figure it out, because I knew that I was here on the Monday and probably on the Sunday&mdash;so what was I doing on the Tuesday? I asked my wife as a matter of fact, and she said, `I drove you from the service for the victims of Port Arthur to an air force plane.' What had happened was that I had come down in an air force plane&mdash;there was no record of my coming back&mdash;and I had been dropped off, as far as I can work out, in Melbourne, where I stayed overnight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has made a number of points. I acknowledge, first of all, that his points about the process in this have some merit. However, I want to assure him that there was no deliberate attempt to ambush either him or other senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to say that the issue of where travel allowance is located did not revolve only around this report; it had been a matter of public and political discussion around the building for several months beforehand. But he does make the point that some senators would not have had the opportunity of reading the report before voting on the substance of it. Hence, I do not think there is any objection today to having the matter recommitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then we go to the issues of substance. Senator Harradine says that in terms of separation of powers this is a wrong move. I am afraid all the powers are pretty mixed up already. So what he is talking about is not a matter of principle; he is talking about a matter of degree. Many of the entitlements are already paid by government. No matter what happens in this, salaries will continue to be paid for senators, other than those who are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6940"> office holders, by the Department of the Senate. So there is no division and there is no rationalisation when everything is one area. That point should be made first of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, those who support travel allowance being in the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;or indeed, if you go to the other argument that it should be in the Senate and all travel should be paid by the Senate&mdash;are basically centralisers. I am one of those. I believe a centralised system makes it easier to keep track of reconciliation between various elements than where it is dispersed over areas in which inevitably there are turf fights. Albeit that the Department of the Senate and DAS probably get along on most issues, there will be turf fights, and I think we should try to eliminate those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party in opposition adopted a view some months ago that all travel allowance, both House of Representatives and Senate, should go to the DAS. One of the strongest reasons we put forward in regard to this&mdash;apart from centralisation and reconciliation&mdash;really goes back to the separation of powers, Senator Harradine. If it is going to be a matter of political controversy&mdash;and it continues to be so and it may disappear in the near future but at the moment, one has to say, payment of travel allowance is a matter of political controversy&mdash;we in opposition would much rather have an adversarial relationship with the Department of Administrative Services and their minister than with the Department of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As backbench and frontbench opposition senators and others we tend to have a different relationship with the Department of the Senate than with other government departments. That is reflected in the government's view that they are not going to have the general Public Service reform bill apply to officers of the Senate but have a separate bill. We do not like having a situation where, when we are not satisfied with travel allowance claims, we have as our adversary across the table&mdash;who is not really an adversary&mdash;President Reid. We do not like the various clerks having to try to defend&mdash;or in some way be embarrassed to expose&mdash;problems in this area, because they deal with other Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> colleagues. To us, it has always made more sense to put it in the more political arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that, Senator Harradine would say, `Yes, but if you put it in a more political arena they are more likely to misuse and abuse it.' That is only true to the degree to which you do not apply accountability to it. Senator Harradine would no doubt say, `Look, the Sharp matter'&mdash;and I am not going into the details of it&mdash;`shows that there can be political interference in these area.' I say that the exposure of that says you cannot get away with it. I say that it is always likely to surface in some way in any event and that you can make a government and a minister accountable for travel allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, these travel allowance claims&mdash;for ministerial and office holder, backbench and frontbench&mdash;should be in the House of Representatives. These various reports that they have commissioned to get the systems up and working&mdash;and no&hyphen;one argues that they are at the moment&mdash;will improve the system. The same techniques in the process of accountability that KPMG is doing at the moment in terms of all the rest of us will be able to be applied by DAS in future, and you will not have these issues coming up again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pretty certain you will not have these issues coming up again, but that will not be because of where we locate travel allowance claims or of what reconciliation we do. No&hyphen;one ever again will deliberately manipulate travel allowance. However, I do add, Madam Acting Deputy President, that there will always be mistakes. Senator Harradine will even do his for the wrong sitting days. If that has not happened another 40 times I will jump in the lake. I have my letter and I am all clear; I was probably lucky that I did not make a mistake. What we want to see in terms of accountability is that there is no repeated abuse of travel allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We argue that that will be best done in a centralised system. If it is centralised it has to be in either the Department of the Senate or DAS. We would prefer it to be DAS because, in terms of a political relationship, we believe we can pursue when necessary an adversarial relationship with DAS when we may be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6941"> extremely reluctant to do so with the Department of the Senate because of its unique relationship with senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure, even though there is some heartbreak in the Department of the Senate at losing this particular matter to DAS, there will also be a sense of relief. I am sure that our valued officers in the Senate do not like calling senators in and do not like saying, `We think you have misclaimed.' They do not like that sort of relationship, because it is a department that not only administers but also gives advice and help to senators. Basically, that is why it has such a high reputation. That reputation will be tarnished if its officers are also given the tasks of policemen on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to your arguments, Senator Harradine. Maybe it is very hard to convince anyone to change their mind, but you have not done so today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two issues that we are looking at today. The first is the issue of the recommittal. I am tempted to begin a rave on this one but I will try to restrain myself. I believe that we are seeing, time and time again, governments avoiding the processes of the parliament. I could give lots of examples of that. Instead, I will simply make an appeal to the Senate that is based on the problem that we have right throughout Western democracies, that people are becoming more and more alienated from democratic processes. That is a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do people feel that they are not involved in the democratic processes, but the parliament itself and members of parliament feel alienated. I do not think that has come about deliberately, but certainly, in asking for a recommittal, it is against the background of that climate of alienation of representatives and of the people themselves who feel that the political and parliamentary processes are beyond them. Here is another example which will simply add to that feeling of alienation. So that issue of recommittal is the first issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray raised the issue of the substance of this. I listened very carefully to what he said, and I say to him that I am willing to change my mind, but he certainly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has not convinced me. The first thing that needs to be said is that there was no substance at all in the report itself. It was only one page long. The only substance was in the dissenting report. The dissenting report picked up the substance of the Baxter report to government, which none of us has been able to read, although it was read by officers of the Senate. We were given some idea of the substance of that report in the dissenting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that dissenting report it was very clear that there was no reason at all that could justify the government or the opposition supporting this change. The dissenting report sets out very clearly that, far from there being a reason for the change, there are reasons for the system to remain as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem in relation to the matter which Senator Ray raised about Mr Sharp is that, as I understand it, none of the travel allowances of ministers have been audited, although those of the rest of us have. Is that going to happen if we transfer to DAS?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a rather savage irony in relation to this report. It is ironic that we have Senator Newman coming into the chamber and talking about how many tens of thousands of people she has managed to throw off social security in one week, and wearing it as a badge of pride. This is the politicisation of a process which, in my opinion, should be done with the discretion of professional officers under ministerial and professional guidelines, but not politicised to the point where you actually take away the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6942"> discretion of officers to look at the circumstances of individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, tens of thousands of people have been thrown off their means of living&mdash;for various reasons; sometimes for not filling out a form, or for not knowing that they needed to fill out a form, or for getting in an hour late on a deadline or for not turning up for an interview, perhaps because they did not have the bus fare. You can understand why the community is getting pretty ratted off with the way things are being dealt with in relation to such things as parliamentarians' travel allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that, I cannot understand why the Labor Party is suggesting that it would like more politicisation rather than less. It is saying that the two&hyphen;party adversarial system is actually somehow or other going to give people more confidence in the system than a carefully crafted approach to make sure that the system is right, that the checks and balances are there and that it is not a process of politicisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can understand why the public is losing more and more confidence in the parliamentary process because the community has been treated that way. The community has been treated badly in such areas as social welfare. They have been treated as frauds. They have been considered guilty. Because of a ministerial edict to throw people off their entitlements, people with no money have had to try to take legal action to get back what they were in fact legally entitled to. I can understand that anger. We should be moving to make sure that the processes are right within this Senate and that we do not make a politicisation of what should be a careful and independent administrative process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would like to comment on Senator Ray's comments about the separation of powers. Over time, Senator Harradine and I have mentioned the concept of the separation of powers, a constitutional guarantee supposedly. I believe this is where the use of precedence is in fact an abuse. If things have been done wrongly in the past, and if the separation of powers has been threatened by the way the House of Representatives often takes action because it knows that the executive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government will get its way because of the numbers, that is not and never should be an excuse. It is not a precedent. If somebody has been acting unconstitutionally and we know the reasons why, that is no excuse for the Senate to condone an abuse of the supposed constitutional protections of this nation. That is an abuse of precedent. To say that something has been done wrongly in the past is no excuse for doing it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are plenty of examples in this place. One that I have spoken of on a number of occasions is the fact that, supposedly for financial reasons, more and more we get departmental officers in on committees. The House of Representatives has been doing it for a long time, but more and more it is becoming the accepted norm. I do not accept that that is right. I do not accept that having people who are beholden to the executive is right in terms of committee processes. I think it is an abuse of the separation of powers, but the fact that that has happened before is now being used as a precedent for using it more and more either in joint committees or in Senate committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is any reason why this should not be challenged every time it happens. If it is against the constitutional guarantees of this nation, every time it happens it is also a threat to the constitutional guarantees of this nation. Maybe we have to talk about this. Maybe, when we have the debate on the constitution, we have to talk about such things as the separation of powers. Do we as a nation still think that the executive, the courts and the parliament should be separate? If that is the case, we should build in the checks and balances. We should make sure that we do not get to this ridiculous situation where they are eroded so much that the erosion itself is seen as a precedent for continuing to do the wrong thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much support Senator Harradine's concerns. I am glad that this vote has been committed, but I am very sad that the Labor Party is seeing fit to do what might seem to be, for it, the easiest political solution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6943"> do not think this is a big issue because I simply see it as an administrative matter. Most of us here, I think, strongly support the principle of the separation of powers. It is one of the safeguards of our democratic system, but there are areas where it becomes blurred and quite tricky.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big area of consequence that we have debated many times is the one of fiscal independence, if I could put it in those terms. The debate has been as to whether the parliament has the right to determine what funds are necessary to do its job properly and the responsibility of the executive to the taxpayer to ensure that the parliament does not spend in excess of what is necessary to do its job properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had various quarrels about that that I can remember well. I can remember former Senator Walsh as finance minister holding a very strong view on that, which I think I argued with on occasions. The outcome was generally a compromise, and I think it has worked reasonably well. So I can understand those areas where it can be argued that a decision by the executive can threaten in some way the independence of the legislature, or the capacity of the legislature to operate effectively, but this seems to me to be fundamentally different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question here of either the allowances changing as a result of a transfer of the administration or someone having some greater discretion in relation to those allowances or a capacity to exert undue influence as a result of those allowances. If there was, I think there would be a stronger argument. It seems to me that this is purely a question of administrative efficiency, and the concept of all parliamentary allowances being paid through one central administrative office&mdash;and the Department of Administrative Services seems as logical to me as any other&mdash;seems to be a sensible result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, certainly in my participation in this committee and in expressing my views elsewhere, I was prepared to support the recommendation, and I have to say that I have not heard anything today that would cause me to change my mind. If I had heard an argument that I thought demonstrated that as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> result of the decision in some way the Senate was going to be limited in its capacity to perform the task with which it is entrusted I might have been otherwise persuaded, but I do not think that that case has been made out.</PARA>

Our position this morning is that, though we are still of the view that national schemes should be exempt, the range of schemes that are exempt under 61(7) goes too far. Senator Margetts raised the question of the native title scheme. This is a scheme which no-one in this place anticipated would be exempt by the operation of the legislation, but I think there is a fair case to argue that it can be seen to be exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not prepared to support the government's position at the moment. It is too wide. I do not know if the minister has any advice for us to consider, but, even if he has, I think it might be a bit hasty for us to consider it this morning. We will just see what he has got. Our position at the moment essentially is that we cannot support 61(7). We would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6944"> like the government to spend some time thinking about how they can exempt schemes. We put one idea to them yesterday. Maybe they can look at a scheduled approach to this problem or maybe they can look at redrafting 61(7). Our concern does not just go to the Native Title Act; it goes to a whole range of schemes that might be in place, whether in the child&hyphen;care area, HACC related services, aged services and so on. There is a larger program of devolving social functions to the states. We would be concerned that those functions were not also exempted by the operation of 61(7).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a legitimate concern. We do share the government's aspirations. We do not think 61(7) achieves a proper balance. It may very well be appropriate for us to either defer consideration of this or to in fact bowl over 61(7) at this stage and the government can give some consideration to other ways of attacking this problem when the bill goes back to the House of Representatives. It is fair to say that we have come to this with the same intentions as the government, but we do not share with it the ambit of 61(7) as it is currently drafted. We want to find some constructive way through it, but we are not prepared to support 61(7) this morning. Senators Margetts and Harradine have persuaded us to a certain extent.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Bolkus mentioned is true. I gave just one example, but others have come forward overnight. It was pointed out that we currently do not have any national standards on anything environmentally that I know of but we might have some responsibility on such things in the future, and these could all not be subject to disallowance either. We have mainly social issues, Aboriginal issues and things like environmental standards which may well be out of the purview of accountability of the parliament. That is really not

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the advice that was sought, I advise the Senate that, as I understood them, there were a number of questions. The first one was: are the existing Native Title Act and proposed native title bill with their proposed subordinate legislation to be regarded as an intergovernmental scheme? That is the point I think Senator Bolkus touched on. The answer to that is no. The advice states that the enabling legislation does not or will not facilitate the establishment or operation of an intergovernmental body or scheme involving the Commonwealth and one or more other states within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the subclause. Nor does or will the enabling legislation have either of the effects specified in paragraph (c) of the subclause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to paragraph (a) of the subclause, it is necessary only to consider whether the enabling legislation does or will facilitate the establishment or operation of a scheme. It is clear from the terms of the provision that a scheme may yet to be established or may have pre&hyphen;existed the enabling legislation with reference to facilitating the operation of a scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS> relevantly defines `scheme' as `a plan or design to be followed . . . a program of action'. This suggests that a scheme must have some orderly sequence or ongoing operation according to established rules or principles. Moreover, the reference in the paragraph to the involvement of the Commonwealth and one or more states suggests that a scheme in the present context must be a concerted plan or program of action involving the agreement of the Commonwealth and one or more states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question was: is any regulation made pursuant to the existing Native Title Act or any regulation under the proposed bill disallowable? The answer is yes. In relation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6945"> to paragraph (c) of the subclause, the fact that section 214 of the Native Title Act makes or will make all of the ministerial determinations in question disallowable instruments within the meaning of the present Acts Interpretation Act indicates clearly that the determinations were intended to be disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions authorising the making of the determinations therefore cannot be construed for the purposes of paragraph (c) as having the effect that determinations cannot be disallowed or could not be disallowed before the commencement date. This would be the case even if section 214 is not amended to take account of the changes proposed to be made to the Acts Interpretation Act by the Legislative Instruments Bill in relation to disallowance and other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third question, as I understood it, was: in the event that the answer to question No. 1 is yes, what effect will subclause 61(7) of the bill have on the existing native title legislation and the proposed native title legislation? That question No. 1 was whether the native title legislation and proposed legislation constituted a scheme. If it was to be construed as a scheme, the advice is that it is not considered that the determinations would fall within the provision. That applies to whether the native title legislation is a scheme or not. So that is the advice the government has obtained in the short time available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a general comment about legislation. When you are looking at a provision like subsection 61(7), in my view it should be clear so that members of the parliament can be quite clear as to what they are dealing with. If you have legislation where you need a legal opinion to clarify what the position is I think that raises some worries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation should be as clear as possible. That means that legislation should be in a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most that legal interpretations can do is give a person's opinion, a highly qualified and very learned person's opinion, as to what a particular piece of legislation might mean. Of course it is not definitive. It is always bad, I think, to have to rely on opinions which, by their very nature, cannot be definitive. If there are problems with subclause 61(7) to the extent of requiring opinions, I think what we ought to do is perhaps improve on subclause 61(7).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is an excellent point made by Senator Cooney in his usual style. It is a bit disconcerting when, on the face of it, one understands from subsection 61(7) that these national schemes, which involve the Commonwealth or one or more states, are such that it is clear that they are exempt from the provisions of the legislation. Now we have a legal opinion or a view&mdash;I do not know which it is&mdash;from the Office of the General Counsel saying certain things. I have not had a look at them. I heard what the minister has said and I acknowledge and thank him for getting that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I agree with what Senator Cooney said. Indeed, the minister himself said, I think his last statement, which I do not have a copy of, `if it were to be construed to be a national scheme or an agreement between the Commonwealth and one state'. So in his mind, and even in the mind of the person who wrote the opinion, there is a question. In any event, if it not clear, who is to say that if it does come before the courts, the courts may have another view altogether? Then where are we?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am on the subject, and I do not want to belabour it, the minister obtained advice from his officers yesterday which, on reflection, he might like to change. When the matter of certificates was being considered, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6946"> when we were talking about the Attorney's certificate as to whether a matter was an instrument which would come under this particular legislation, as you know we adopted an amendment to the legislation which declares that those instruments are themselves disallowable instruments. If I go to page 6773 of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the previous government was in office, it introduced its bill in 1994. It was taken up as a recommendation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee at that time. In fact, the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, accepted it. So that is the history of it. I am sure that the parliamentary secretary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would know that. In any event, the AD(JR) processes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the minister was saying that may be the way to go, instead of declaring that certificate would itself be a disallowable instrument; why not go the other route&mdash;the legal route? I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, the AD(JR) process is not binding on the Attorney&hyphen;General under this bill, is it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The response by the minister&mdash;and I recall him getting advice from his department&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is. It is binding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, it is not binding. It is binding for the Attorney&hyphen;General to consider the decisions. But that of itself does not bind the Attorney&hyphen;General to a particular course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In certain areas I am a bit concerned about the quality of advice. I know the officers concerned are not involved in the other glaring example of the minister's office or whoever advised the minister on the NVE classification. That was an absolutely glaring example of a demonstrably false statement by the Attorney&hyphen;General of this country on quite an important matter to many people in this country. I do believe that we should adopt the amendment that is currently before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am on my feet, I would ask the minister, what are the government's aims in regard to this matter? Some reference to the government's aims were adverted to by Senator Bolkus and I just wonder what they are. Are the government's aims in respect of their opposition to this amendment? Is it their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aim that the power should be taken away from the Commonwealth parliament alone in these particular national schemes, that is, in respect of our rights to exercise our powers in respect of disallowing subordinate legislation under these national schemes? That is what he is doing. That is what the government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state legislatures will still have that power. The territory legislatures will still have that power. It appears that the government is saying that, in Commonwealth and state national schemes, the Commonwealth parliament should not have the power and should not exercise that power which we have to protect the rights of individuals, and indeed, as I said yesterday, exercise our `function of audit and control over executive government decisions.'</PARA></SPEECH>

The other is for us to report progress on this particular provision and reconsider the bill at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think from discussions with the minister, it might be best for us to support Senator Margetts's amendment at this stage and put on notice to the Senate that, in doing so, we do not say outright that there should be no exemption for national schemes. We do say that we would like to consider this matter further to see how it can best be refined to cover the sorts of schemes that the govern

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apropos of what Senator Harradine is talking about&mdash;the standing of the decision of the court if an appeal is taken under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act&mdash;the issue of whether it is an advise to the Attorney-General or is of a more binding character needs to be resolved. Is there any provision under the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF>  presently before us which enables the decision of an Attorney-General to be set aside and another decision by a tribunal, whether it be a court or an AAT, to be substituted?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is the confusion that is presently before us. Is it simply that the Federal Court can say the Attorney-General has not gone around his task in accordance with the law or is it simply that it gives him very strong advice? Just what is the nature of it? The impression being left at the moment is that somehow the court can substitute its decision for that of the Attorney-General.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Senator Cooney's question, which of course dovetails with Senator Harradine's question yesterday, the answer is no, a replacement decision cannot be made. As to the effect on the Attorney-General, in relation to proposed subclause 8(6), I touched on the action of the Federal Court yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might just follow it through. The Attorney-General issues a certificate. There is then a review of that decision available. The Federal Court can then quash or set aside the decision. The Attorney-General then must reconsider the matter. If the Attorney-General thumbs his or her nose at the Federal Court 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and reissues the certificate, it is then a fresh matter again and subject to the same review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my advice is that, although the Federal Court quashes the decision, it goes back to the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General is bound to reconsider the decision. If the Attorney-General is truculent to the court, if I can put it that way, and says, `No, I want to make the same decision,' then it can go back to the court. It keeps going in that circular motion, which would very soon, I would imagine, bring the Attorney-General into some sort of question. In the meantime, nothing further would progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that is the practical effect of this review mechanism. There is some sanction there, if you like&mdash;more than some sanction to the Attorney-General, because the Attorney-General knows that, if he or she makes that same decision again, it is back to the court.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, we have some concerns about the broad nature of the sunsetting of legislative instruments. Although I had circulated some amendments which sought to tackle the issue, on reflection and after further discussion with other senators yesterday, it became apparent to the opposition that what was being proposed had much broader implications, and some fairly negative implications, for the system of regulation and legislative instruments that currently prevails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments I have now moved go to deleting part 6, and to bringing in a provision which will ensure that each responsible minister, as soon as practicable after 30 June each year, has a report prepared on measures taken to determine whether the register contains any instrument made under enabling legislation administered by that minister which is no longer necessary, and to report on action taken to remove from the register any instrument which has been identified as no longer necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a concern that there are instruments which should in fact be withdrawn because they are no longer necessary. Part of the motivation for a sunset provision in the bill was to weed out such dead instruments but, in doing so, the legislation, once again, goes a bit too far. Although the provision of a five&hyphen;year across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board sunset provision would have the effect of ensuring that only relevant legislation is kept alive, such a broad sunset provision will ensure that a lot of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> instruments which are still necessary would also lapse because of the provisions of the sunset part of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, particularly instruments of social relevance have long&hyphen;term effect and need to have long-term effect. For instance, I would not like to be in a situation where, in five years time, a regime of quarantine, migration, education, employment, environmental, consumer and privacy related instruments were all to lapse because of us passing this legislation in the broad terms in which it is appearing before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern I have is not that it would lapse, but that there is no way for a house of the parliament to ensure such legislative instruments would continue in effect. We do not have the capacity here to introduce instruments. After this bill gets through we may have some capacity to amend, if the other house agrees with the amendments put up by the Senate, but we do not have a capacity to ensure that any relevant and important instrument will have a continuing effect if part 6 gets through in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we tried to find another way of doing this to try to balance the need to eradicate the not relevant instruments at the end of a five-year period. On reflection, I think the amendment that I had circulated does not protect against a wholesale extinguishment of such instruments after five years. It also does not really give us sufficient capacity to keep any individual instrument that we deem to be necessary to keep alive. That just cannot be done under the first series of amendments that I circulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, I think it is playing on the safe side, but doing a bit more than that; it is playing on a side which protects the public with respect to so many social areas and also economic areas. You cannot really talk about environmental instruments without having some economic impact. You cannot talk about any of the areas I have talked about without them having broader than a specific policy concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To satisfy a need to continue weeding the not so relevant instruments, in discussion with some senators, and with some thought given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6951"> to it even late last night, the opposition feels that a good way to approach this would be to ensure that there is some accountability to the parliament for a process which would weed out the dead and not so relevant instruments. That is the process that I signalled is embodied in amendment No. 1 on page 671; that is, an annual reporting by ministers to parliament on steps taken on stocktakes that, for instance, have been taken in the course of the year to clean up the instrument register. Such a clause makes the ministers and, more importantly, the departments focus on this issue annually. In a sense, it is probably better than a five-year sunsetting provision in terms of getting rid of not relevant instruments in that it makes the departments focus on it continually. There will be a need for an annual report to this place and, as a consequence of the need for an annual report, departments will have to focus on this issue in a continuing sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start, this is not the position taken by the amendments that we first circulated but, having had a closer look at the bill and having had discussions yesterday, I think it is important for us not to proceed with a blanket extinguishment of legislative instruments after five years. If it is possible to do so, I also should move the amendment on page 671, on the basis that this amendment and the previous amendments be voted on separately.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More and more, Western Australia is called the sunset coast. From the sunset coast, we are talking about sunsets here. But I think what Senator Bolkus is talking about is eclipsing the sunset. In this particular case, I am prepared to support the eclipsing of this sunset. It is a problem if the whole of the legislative instruments get dumped&mdash;certainly at all at once. It is going to be a heck of a problem in five years time when they start coming up at the same time. Perhaps there will be administrative problems where there are good reasons why delegated legislation and legislative instruments have been put in place. So I think the addition of the review of annual reports is a good one; therefore, I will be supporting Senator Bolkus's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After regulations or legislative instruments are made and pass the disallowance period after tabling, the Senate has no opportunity to revisit these regulations, ever. If the government makes or remakes regulations in a particular subject area, then we do indeed deal with the new regulation but not the old. The regulations stay there forever until the government wants to remove them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's provision in part 6 of the bill would have meant that all legislative instruments would sunset after five years&mdash;that is, after they were made&mdash;and would expire and cease to have effect unless the purpose of the legislative instrument to which this section applied was to confer rights on a person that were intended to have a long-term effect and unless the Governor-General was satisfied that the operation of a subsection in relation to that instrument would have frustrated that purpose, and then the anniversary period would have been 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall that in my speech on the second reading, we clearly indicated that we felt that the sunsetting provisions were an attractive part of the bill. Not only did we see that there was a utility component to it, if you like, in that you could chop out what was undoubtedly dead wood&mdash;old and difficult regulations&mdash;but also we hoped that, in the stocktaking manner that Senator Bolkus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6952"> alluded to, there would be opportunity for regulations to be brought back into the house and be reconsidered in a reframed manner. Consequently, knowing what the advantages of the proposed system were, we found it difficult to have to debate the downside because the downside is that so much good&mdash;as the whole Senate considers it to be good&mdash;could be swept out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Australian Democrats would concur with the views of Senator Bolkus that we would like the government to revisit and to re-examine this area. However, I should advise you that we have been persuaded by the arguments of Senator Bolkus. Overall, what affects us is our view that the primacy of parliament must be maintained or, as Senator Harradine quite rightly pointed out, it is the role and the duty of the Senate to perform an audit role of executive actions. If regulations or legislative instruments are automatically sunset, we think it may create a vacuum whereby strong regulatory measures&mdash;many of them enhancing the human and procedural rights of ordinary Australians&mdash;may be placed at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, we recognise your very good case for the considerable benefits of the notion of a sunset clause, but we have also been persuaded that at this stage the risks are greater than the benefits. We are reluctant to take that risk because we can see that there is a double-edged sword. In swinging it down to chop out the dead wood, we might swing it up and chop out some better parts of the regulatory systems applicable in this country. Accordingly, we will be supporting these amendments but we do repeat Senator Bolkus's view that, if you can revisit this in some other manner, we would certainly be willing to consider your alternative proposals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say at the outset that the government's election policy was to ensure that all new regulations would be subject to a five-year sunset clause. Indeed, the sunsetting of delegated legislation is an important component of the government's policy on regulation review. The government believes that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this will ensure that the regulation of business is reduced to the minimum necessary and that remaining delegated legislation is regularly considered for its appropriateness, currency, effectiveness and necessity. It is the government's belief that this sunsetting is an effective means of cutting back the dead wood. There can remain for years regulations which are absolutely irrelevant and redundant, and this sunsetting will do away with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a good deal of support for the stand it takes on sunsetting. The Administrative Review Council recommended that all existing principal instruments of a legislative character and all instruments subject to the proposed Legislative Instruments Act should be sunsetted. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs also recommended that a sunsetting regime be introduced in relation to all existing and future legislative instruments as soon as possible. As well as that, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearer Commonwealth law</EMPHASIS> and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> also supported the introduction of a sunsetting program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it can be seen that there is a good deal of support for the sunsetting regime in relation to legal instruments. I can say that this is a matter which has not been greeted warmly by the bureaucracy because it does place an onus on the bureaucracy to make sure that the good wood does not fall away with the bad. So that places an onus on the bureaucracy as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that the sunsetting of legislative instruments is not designed to see good law done away with; moreover, it is designed to see bad law done away with&mdash;law that is no longer relevant or law that is redundant. So the government is firmly of the view that a sunsetting regime is appropriate. In any event, there is always the scrutiny of the Senate, by its committees available, to the question of regulations. It is not taking any question of review away.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6953">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, if a good regulation were coming up for the sunset period, it would be open for the Senate, via its committees and via this chamber, to raise these questions with the government: are you going to introduce a new instrument? What are you going to do about the sunsetting of this? That is a question which could be raised by the Senate to the government, and quite rightly so. So the government believes that it does not take away any question of review, but it provides a system of cleaning out the Augean stables, so to speak.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R254">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . I suppose it is quite a difficult bill to tackle in some way&mdash;not because any of the issues raised are particularly complex, but it follows a general tendency of this government to put a whole group of largely unrelated measures together. Often it appears to me that it is an attempt to disguise some of the more negative aspects contained within it. This is one of those bills. Some of the measures contained in it are worth while; others are really quite unpalatable and will make Australian families worse off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains measures that are beneficial but it does not hide those measures that are going to be harsh on families in Australia. Although the name of the bill contains the words `Family and Other Measures', the majority of it does not help families but continues to whittle away the safety net that protects many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree that it does contain some measures that will be beneficial but, as I have already stated, for a lot of families&mdash;and particularly for those who are struggling at the moment, who are on low incomes&mdash;it will mean that it will be harder to make ends meet and harder to put a decent roof over their head and their children's head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first major measure in the bill relates to immunisation. The schedule puts in place the payment of a maternity immunisation allo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wance. This is an encouragement for families to immunise their children. It appears that it is quite necessary for this to occur in light of the declining rates of immunisation. In fact, the AMA indicated that 457 children died between 1980 and 1990 from diseases that they could have been immunised against. That has to be a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure provides the parents with a payment of $200 if the child is immunised at 18 months in addition to the $750 paid on birth. This is essentially the same maternity allowance that was introduced by the Labor government, with the small addition of $68. These two payments are divided in half and paid on birth and at 18 months respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some let&hyphen;out clauses are provided in the bill for a situation where the parent is a conscientious objector to immunisation or where the child has some contrary medical indicator against immunisation. I see this as a positive step to encourage parents to immunise their children. It is a move that the opposition fully supports, and it has indicated on many occasions that it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The payment is also coupled with an education campaign to encourage parents to immunise and financial incentives for general practitioners. There has also been a continuation of the Labor Party initiative to put in place an immunisation register. There appears to be some uncertainty at the moment about the continued funding of this register. When the  Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) is on his feet, I would appreciate it if he could indicate whether the funding for the register does continue post 1 July 1997. I hope he noted that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the immunisation plan is ostensibly designed to encourage parents to immunise, it concerns me that the bill indicates that over two years this change will save the Commonwealth some $30 million. That is really the sting in the tail&mdash;the fact that this government will make budget savings out of such a worthwhile initiative by punishing parents rather than encouraging them to immunise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6956">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not clear from the budget papers exactly where these savings will be derived from, but it would appear that they will be derived from parents who are unable to access the maternity allowance, child&hyphen;care assistance or the home child&hyphen;care allowance. It is worrying that those parents who fail to comply with the requirements of immunisation and who find it most difficult to overcome these hurdles are often families of low income or families who are suffering other difficulties. It is sad that the immunisation program, which is so worth while, is marred by this negative effect that may mean that families who are worse off than others will be punished even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal with schedules 2 to 11&mdash;the second major portion of the bill&mdash;which relate largely to the family payment, the parenting allowance and, in a minor way, the maternity allowance. Many of these changes remedy difficulties that were brought about when the original basic family payment and the family supplement were amalgamated and when further budget decisions were made that caused some unintended consequences. Many of these amendments are superficial and really go to rectifying those legislative irregularities, but there are changes within schedule 6 which make the social security system more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first set of amendments deals with payments for more than the minimum rate of family payments while the child is outside Australia. The opposition welcomes and supports this measure, but also recognises that the way the government has implemented it introduces an anomaly into the portability arrangements for various social security payments. Labor's amendments to the schedule will remove this anomaly and align family payment portability arrangements with those applying to allowances. I will not deal with this now as it will be dealt with in some detail during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay some particular attention to schedule 16 which contains the revised impairment tables used to assess eligibility for disability support pensions. An earlier version of these tables was introduced by the government last year, and members of the Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may recall that it was withdrawn while being debated in the Senate. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) advised that she would consult with representatives of disability groups and those who are affected, and would come back with an agreed set of tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister indicated in her second reading speech that 38 disability and welfare groups were consulted on these new tables. It is interesting to note that the minister did not actually state that the groups were in agreement. I am aware from correspondence that there is a great deal of disagreement over these proposed tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A strong concern in the community is that the tables disregard impairments valued at less than five per cent. This means that if you do not have disabilities that are in excess of five per cent&mdash;that reach the requirement of a total of 20 per cent disability&mdash;you in fact miss out on eligibility for the disability support pension. This means that people with multiple disabilities, where these multiple disabilities substantially affect their ability to work and also their ability to get work, will be missing out on their disability payments, though in the past they would have received them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that as a result of this change the government will pay out $8 million less in disability support pensions over three years. This seems to be the main concern of this government, rather than the responsibility our community has to support those who are not able to access the work force because of their disabilities. I often feel that we have hit the lowest limit of how low this government will stoop. I thought we had reached that when they attempted to take away entitlements for hearing services for those aged between 18 and 20, but I have to say that these changes to the disability tables hit a new low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some comments about schedule 16 of the bill. I understand that there were some discussions between the Democrats and the government about making some changes to make this a more equitable and fairer proposition. I understand that the Democrats have agreed to support the impairment tables in the form that is before us, to vote with the government to get the tables 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6957"> through, on the promise&mdash;I understand&mdash;of a review. I must say that, if I were a Democrat and looked at core promises and non&hyphen;core promises, I would be a little worried about whether in fact that promise will be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will evaluate the new tables in 18 months time. To me, that seems to be a long time in which to sell out people who are disabled and, in particular, people with multiple disabilities. I was hoping that Senator Woodley would be in the chamber. Maybe the reason he is not in the chamber is that his conscience is pricking him a little bit. Maybe he is concerned about the thousands of disability support pensioners who will be reviewed under these new impairment tables and will have their payments cancelled. I hope he will pay particular attention to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people will be forced to compete in the job market for the first time. Many of them will end up with no income at all. Thousands more Australians who will be applying for disability support pensions for the first time in the next few months will not qualify, though they would have qualified under the old tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and my other colleagues in the Labor Party represent the interests of these lower income people and those people with disabilities who obviously have great difficulty in entering the work force and often have no resources or assets and little access to other income. We are very concerned about the arrangements that the Democrats have made with the government to ensure that these tables get through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the face of this arrangement, this deal&mdash;and I would go so far as to say this sell&hyphen;out of many people who are disabled&mdash;we will not be attempting to amend schedule 16, as obviously we can count and we know we will not be successful. But I hope that Senator Woodley and the other members of the Democrats look back at this decision today with regret and that those people in the community who lose their disability support pension write in very strong terms to Senator Woodley and the Democrats and indicate their concern. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter that I would like to deal with today is the changes in rent assistance brought about by this bill. This, again, is a matter of some extreme callousness. The government has tried to railroad the reform of housing assistance by reducing the amount of rental assistance that is provided for a whole range of people, but it seems to me that it is only part of a general running down of the Commonwealth's contribution to housing around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second leg of providing affordable housing through the Commonwealth is the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. When this government first got in, it reduced the housing agreement from a period of three years to a period of one year. This ruled out the possibility of long-term planning and also any long-term capital commitment by the states in their public housing. It seems now that any capacity for reform and negotiation between the states in the area of public housing has collapsed. This government has now conceded that the interim agreement, as they describe it, will continue until the end of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been cutting back the direct funding of public housing. In fact, they cut $50 million a year. It was indicated to us in estimates that this was to come from general efficiencies. Very clearly, this means that fewer houses will be built for public housing this year. In fact, in New South Wales they have already indicated that they plan to reduce their construction of public housing units from the present 3,500 units a year to just 680 this year. It is a matter of great concern for us and for the community at large that we are not only reducing the amount of public housing available when there are huge waiting lists but also cutting the access to rental assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular difficulty with rental assistance is that it attacks young people who are living in housing commission or public housing and whose income has already been taken into account to determine the rate of rent that is paid. That means that these young people, who at present may be obtaining some sort of financial support, particularly if they are also unemployed, would have declared 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6958"> that income and, accordingly, the rent that their family as a whole is paying for that public housing would be increased. These young people then make some contribution from their generally small income towards the rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty is, of course, that this measure takes away the payment of rental assistance for those young people. So, even though their income is taken into account in determining rent, they will no longer receive the rental assistance that every other person is entitled to if they are in that income band.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes us wonder why this government dislikes young people so much. Why is it that they are not entitled to rental assistance? Why is it that in the future they will not be entitled to a payment when they are out of work? It really does seem a very sad thing for our young people that they somehow are not entitled to the same support as older people, that they are of less value to the community, that in fact this Commonwealth government cares less about young people than it does about everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, this bill is an amalgamation of many provisions, but there are four major areas that we are concerned about. We are concerned that the immunisation provisions will be used to punish families, those who have a lower income and who may not be able to access the child&hyphen;care assistance, the home care allowance and the immunisation payments, because they are less likely to make their way through the maze and achieve full immunisation by 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you missed my earlier comments because you were not in the chamber. In brief, the opposition has very much indicated all along support for the encouragement of immunisation and a program for the education and encouragement of parents to immunise their children. But there is a concern within the opposition that the budget savings indicated in this bill show that the end result will not be that more children will be immunised but that a lot of parents on low incomes will be punished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of concern is in relation to family payments. There is concern about the payment for those who are temporarily leav

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk primarily about schedule 16 of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R254">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill</XREF> . This schedule introduces an amended set of revised disability impairment tables to be used when assessing a person's eligibility for the disability support pension, or DSP as we know it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am sure all senators will remember, this is not the first time we have considered the introduction of a revised set of impairment tables. It was something that we looked at in the spring session of parliament last year. At that time the government introduced legislation which would have made it very much harder for people to qualify for the DSP. Because they lowered the ratings for many impairments, last year's disability impairment tables would have ensured that many people receiving the DSP would be thrown off it. It would also have meant that anyone who failed to qualify for the DSP as a result of the new tables would have also become ineligible for many other programs which are specifically designed for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats believe that the disability impairment tables this government introduced last year were insufficiently researched, ill considered and far too harsh. If they had been accepted in their original form, many people with disabilities would have been left without any form of income or any assistance at all. This is because those people who became ineligible for the DSP would have moved on to other forms of income support, principally newstart. They would have been required to look for work and they would have been required to meet the relevant activity tests, with any breach of this being punishable through the withdrawal of income for extended periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government failed to recognise, however, was that many people who may have failed to meet the eligibility requirements for the DSP under the new tables would still not have been capable of consistently meeting the requirements of an activity 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6959"> test and would therefore have faced unfair breaches and the total loss of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were deciding on how we would vote on these tables last year, the Democrats consulted very widely with people with disabilities and those who work with them to help us better understand the implications of what was being proposed. During this consultation process we found that there was a great deal of concern, a great deal of anguish and a great deal of fear about the potential effects of the proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a widespread belief that, yet again, the basic rights and needs of people with disabilities were being ignored. Virtually everyone we spoke to agreed that the ratings the government had allocated to the various impairments in the revised tables were so far removed from the real experiences of people with disabilities that it was almost beyond belief. I do not know: perhaps this huge dichotomy was just a reflection of how out of touch the government was with the needs and the experiences of people with disabilities at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Democrats worked very hard to try to reduce the negative impact of the tables which were being proposed&mdash;the impacts that they would have had on people with disabilities. This was not an easy task, as I think we would all agree, as disability impairment tables are highly technical instruments. But, with a great deal of assistance from those working within the disability sector, the Democrats were able to put together over 60 amendments which, if accepted, would have greatly improved the govern2ment's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to these Democrat amendments, the government withdrew its legislation in the Senate during the debate and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) promised to go away and consult with people working within the disability area before bringing the tables back before the Senate. Over the past nine months I understand that the government has met with a number of groups and individuals within that sector and, as a consequence, has made a number of very positive changes to the tables it presented us with last year. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Democrats are happy to give the government a big tick for some of the changes they have made in response to this latest consultation process. They have improved the requirement to accept treatment regardless of the cost, the possible side effects or the likely impact on a person's disability. They have improved ratings for interrelated conditions; there has been the recognition of some minor impairments and, very importantly, the inclusion of a rating for chronic fatigue. These changes are very positive and very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would hasten to add that there are still several outstanding issues which the government has failed to address, and Senator Neal referred to these a little earlier. These are that some of the tables still do not have ratings for minor impairments, with the psychiatric table being especially harsh in this respect; there is still a wide disparity in assessment ratings across various tables; and the assessment process is still somewhat messy and unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats once again put together a series of amendments aimed at addressing these problems. We have put these amendments together with a great deal of assistance from people who have vast experience in working in the disability area. However, we will not be moving those amendments today. Instead, we will be looking towards moving them when the Senate next considers legislation which amends the Social Security Act 1991. We have decided to take this course because we wish to give the government that additional time it has requested to investigate the effects of these amendments. We also want to ensure that, because of the highly technical nature of the area we are dealing with, there are no unintended consequences associated with the changes we are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this desire in mind, and as a result of the Democrats' negotiations with the government, the minister has also given us a commitment that she will establish a wide ranging review into the operation and effects of the tables we are considering here today and that she will report to the Senate on the outcome of this review in 18 months time. There is also a commitment for an interim report before that time. Whilst the Democrats strong 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6960"> ly believe the substance of our amendments are worthy of the Senate's support, we think it is in the best interests of those who would be most affected by any unintended consequences to take this extra time and proceed down the course I have just outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tables contained in schedule 16 of the bill are, as I said earlier, a vast improvement on the revised disability impairment tables the government presented us with during the spring session of parliament last year. It is good to see that the minister has taken the time to fix many of the problems which were contained in the previous tables. The Democrats will be supporting the schedule today. However, we will be continuing our discussions with the minister and her department and we will be looking at moving our amendments a little further down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of rent assistance for adult family members living with their families in public housing, the Democrats have reserved judgment on this. The decision to remove rent assistance would appear to be fair, at least from a federal perspective. If the public housing rent is already being subsidised in effect by the state government and the tenants are not paying market rent then perhaps we agree it would appear to be generous to offer such people a further subsidy. Of course it must be understood that more and more public housing tenants are being shifted to market rents and state governments such as that in Victoria are making permanent tenure a thing of the past. This may well mean that the savings the federal government expects to make with this measure will not be long lasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, around 44,000 people are expected to be affected by this legislation. I will be very interested in how accurate this figure turns out to be when the department has in place its data matching. The Democrats would like to know whether the changes will have the effect of encouraging family members to seek independent accommodation in order to comply with rent assistance criteria. If this did turn out to be a significant number then perhaps the legislation will do very little more than to increase the waiting lists and put further pressure on the private rental market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will listen to the debate on this matter and apply our usual test of fairness. I would have to say that, compared with the very severe cuts made to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement funds, some $200 million over the next four years, and the defunding of important advocacy groups such as National Shelter, this is likely to be a relatively small saving. We are interested to know what the real effects will be on those who are likely to be affected. In particular, it would appear that these people are doing much better than people on low incomes who are struggling to make ends meet in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be my very strong preference to see this saving, whatever it turns out to be, channelled into provision of new social housing and a reversal of the trend, I might say started by the previous government, to reduce public housing stock to the point where only the most severely disadvantaged welfare tenants are housed. I look forward to the outcome of the current housing inquiry for a way forward on housing in this country. I hope, too, that the government will very seriously look at the recommendations from that inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the two senators for their contribution to this debate. I do feel that Senator Neal is labouring under a misapprehension about the maternity allowance which I would like to explain at this stage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total maternity allowance is increased overall, so it goes up to $950; it currently is $870. The savings are occasioned by the fact that the first payment will be $750 and the remaining $120 of the current payment has $80 added to it and it becomes $200 on the evidence of immunisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it really is impossible for the opposition to let this go through without comment at all. You may recall in many debates in the Senate that the opposition indicated their concern about the inclusion of superannuation in the assets test for those who are 55 and over. There has been a great deal of community concern about this entire issue of people who hit 55 and who, in many cases, have been in the work force for many years. Unfortunately, in this day of restructuring and changes within our industry, and high rates of unemployment, they may find themselves out of the work force and having to access the nest egg that they had put aside&mdash;their superannuation&mdash;at 55, despite the fact they do not intend to retire and are actively seeking to go back into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6963"> honourable senators really believe that, then I am afraid they do not have much understanding of what these amendments mean. I always said that I would exempt, in special circumstances, income from superannuation that people could not access. That is the case and it is limited on a case by case basis to three main areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that I do not have that discretion in relation to the assets test. I could have left it at that, but I chose to make sure that people, particularly allowees, who could get an exemption on the income test could also get an exemption on the assets test. These amendments are simply to give me that discretion&mdash;that beneficial discretion&mdash;to exempt people who might be exempted under the income test but not under the assets test. I imagine you do not have a problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you misread more into these amendments in terms of policy. It is appropriate in these circumstances to make it quite clear that the policy is the one that the previous government administered until 1993 and that all governments have administered in respect of the age pension. What happened in 1993 was we gave a gap, if you like, between the age of 55 and age pension age for people to not have their superannuation included in the assets test, even though for most people over the age of 55 it is accessible to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government thought it was not going to cost a lot to do that. In fact, the predictions about the cost to revenue were quite minor, but the reality was very large. So a responsible government, seeing what misuse was being made of it&mdash;in my view, by financial planners&mdash;moved as soon as possible to shut that option down so that we do not have the ridiculous situation where people who end up not being eligible for age pension at 61 or 65 because of their total assets are eligible for support from the taxpayer from the age of 55 onwards when they do have means that they can use to support themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no further change of policy. We have simply reverted back to what the previous government was doing up to 1993&mdash;the assets test included superannuation. It has gone back to that. There is no change to that. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a pity if the water is so muddy that that very clear situation is not allowed to remain clear, because I think it does a disservice to the people we as senators are all sworn to look after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act simply does not always allow exclusion of a superannuation asset in the same circumstances that an exemption could be provided under the income test. Under the existing legislation I did not have the discretion to exempt those under the assets test but I did under the income test. We are remedying that situation so as to make it quite clear that people do not get free of one but caught on the other.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Newman, I do not want to open the whole policy debate again. I have to make the comment that the Democrats and, I presume, the Labor Party support your amendments. That is not the problem. I do need to say that there is a disagreement on policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' disagreement on policy is that, no matter what the Labor Party did in 1993, after 1993 and up to the present time there has been a sea change in the whole approach to superannuation. That is why going back to 1993 is fairly irrelevant from our point of view in this debate. It does not apply. Superannuation since 1993 and in the intervening years has been changed significantly by a multiparty approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disappointment I have in all of this is that unilaterally the government has denied that multiparty approach which we had for the last few years, is taking a decision which goes against all of the discussions and all of that multiparty agreement which we had, and is doing something with which we now in a policy sense disagree fundamentally.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, certainly we agree that these amendments are going to remedy in a small way part of the problem you caused.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to congratulate Senator Woodley. He is much more perceptive about the overall goals involved in superannuation and its application in this country than is Senator Newman. The changes in 1993 have to be looked at in context, together with, for example, the introduction of the superannuation guarantee which ensures the spread of superannuation to the overwhelming majority of the Australian work force&mdash;I think the latest figures are about 89 per cent. The objective was to allow all Australian workers the choice&mdash;that word is often overused by this government&mdash;of having a decent retirement income, and I stress the words `retirement income'. Where we differ philosophically is this money grab by your government&mdash;I think it is over $125 million a year&mdash;in effect forcing people to retire when they have turned 55 and forcing them to draw down on moneys that are meant for their retirement, not forcing them to draw down on the moneys when they reach 65. That is the fundamental difference in our approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me what we have here is a mismatch in approach between your attitude and the attitude of the Treasurer. Everything we have seen from the government, except for this measure, shows the government is closing off access to superannuation. In the last budget announcement, the government announced a phase&hyphen;in of access for superannuation from 55 to 60. Whether you agree or disagree with that approach, 55 to 60 is going to become the age at which you access superannuation. This measure that is being discussed is in contradiction of that approach&mdash;it is a very strong contradiction. The government has not funded and has again broken its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6965"> commitment to the co&hyphen;contribution, the government funding of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison is well aware from the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that there were three issues we dealt with in respect to closing off access to superannuation that the government announced in the budget and to which we will be moving a disallowance next week. It is the basic contradiction that you have in regard to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have debated the issue extensively on two occasions: one was a win for you, one was a loss for you. Unfortunately, the final outcome has been a loss to those Australian workers who reach the age of 55 and are going to be affected by this dreadful measure. They are not all millionaires&mdash;that is your usual excuse, cutting millionaires out of the system. Certainly in the hundreds and thousands of people who have contacted the opposition, I have not sighted too many millionaires. I do not want to keep the time of the Senate unnecessarily on the central principle. We have debated it before. I conclude by saying that Senator Newman got it wrong in her public announcement and press release.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to schedule 6. The arrangements being put in place create an anomaly which can be easily avoided. The issues revolve around current portability arrangements for primary income payments, and whether or not an income support payment can be made while a person is overseas. As a general rule, pensions like the disability support pension, or a wife pension, can continue to be paid for up to 12 months when a person is overseas. Allowances, on the other hand, like mature age, widow, partner and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6966"> parenting allowance and, in some limited circumstances, sickness allowance, can continue to be paid for up to three months when a person is overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These arrangements recognise that it may be necessary to leave the country temporarily for medical treatment, to visit relatives and for other necessary reasons. The shorter portability arrangements for allowees generally recognise that people of work force age are less likely to go overseas for longer periods as they are looking for work in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the arrangements being proposed by the government, higher rates of family payment will be able to be made to people when they or their children go overseas for up to two months. Previously, higher rates of family payment could be made for up to three months if a parent was absent from Australia, but higher rates of family payment could not be made for any time that a child was outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A classic example of this situation is where a person on a low income, and in receipt of a parenting allowance, and her child, leave Australia temporarily for lengthy medical treatment for the child. The parenting allowee could continue to receive parenting allowance for three months, but the higher rate of family payment would stop after two months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, it is estimated that the Labor Party amendments to schedule 6 as a whole would cost an additional $3.9 million a year. In saying that, I wish to speak to the totality of schedule 6, because the proposals in amendments 4 and 5 have to be seen in the context of the whole schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recognise, Mr Temporary Chairman, that this government has acted to correct an anomaly that existed under the previous government. That anomaly resulted in more than the minimum family payment not being payable in respect of a child as soon as the child left Australia. We believed that that was very harsh. It meant that no payment could be made, even if a child left Australia for urgent medical treatment, for example, or if they were on a short sporting trip with their school, or a choir trip. There were sad stories of children whose last dying wish was to go to Disneyland&mdash;and their families, too, got cut off from the family payment during the period they were away. We thought that, for the small number of people involved, it was desirable to turn it around, even though we were in a difficult financial position in terms of the national budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6967">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposal acts to address that anomaly, but at the same time I believe it is taking a balanced approach to those families affected, as well as the cost to taxpayers as a whole in helping those families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose the direction in which the opposition and the Democrats are going, which is to increase to 13 weeks the length of time during which a family can get family payment overseas and, at the same time, increase to 13 weeks the amount that the more than minimum family payment can be paid when a child goes overseas. We have taken the entitlement for a child to leave the country to a period of eight weeks. In doing that, we have brought back the time that payments can be received while the parents are out of the country from 13 weeks to eight weeks. So it is now a consistent period of eight weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to accept the opposition amendments, everybody could be getting paid by the Australian taxpayer for 13 weeks while they are out of the country, but that would be at an additional $3.9 million. We think we have dealt with the circumstances which we inherited from the previous government in a fair way&mdash;fair to the families and fair to the taxpayers who have to be taken into account as well&mdash;so we would not be inclined to accept the amendments proposed by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The negative effects that arise from changes to the rental assistance were discussed at some length in the speeches on the second reading by all parties, particularly by me. Essentially what it means is that young people who are living within a family which is in public housing will no longer receive the rental assistance that they were previously entitled to. This is a particularly harsh change, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6968"> bearing in mind that the income of such young people will already have been taken into account by the public housing authority in determining the rent that is payable by that family. We believe that, by putting into place this measure proposed by the government, we are double punishing those young people. We see it as a very harsh and unjust provision. So amendment Nos 9 and 10 have the effect of reversing this position and allow young people living with their families in public housing to continue to receive rental assistance where they are otherwise entitled to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important that I put on the record at this stage what this measure really is about. We are intending to remove the entitlement to rent assistance of people who live in public housing but do not pay rent directly to the state or public housing authority, except in those circumstances where they live in public housing where market rents are being charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are doing that because public housing tenants do receive subsidised accommodation from the state and territory housing authorities. Some of the money for that subsidy comes from the Commonwealth government as well. They currently charge rent at between 20 and 25 per cent of income. Accordingly, public housing tenants are not entitled to rent assistance. But the legislation does not preclude the payment of rent assistance to a person who is paying rent for living in public housing but is not paying rent directly to the state or territory authority. We believe it is anomalous that rent assistance may be payable to a person who is living in government subsidised accommodation. The amendments remove the entitlement to rent assistance of any person who pays rent for living in premises in which the public housing tenant receives subsidised accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where subletting is authorised by the state or territory, the state or territory housing authorities assess additional rent at subsidised levels for each subtenant. These additional rents are generally low enough to preclude the subtenants from entitlement to rent assistance. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> But nothing precludes the payment of rent assistance to subtenants who are living in public housing and paying rent to the primary tenant. They are often friends and relatives of the public housing tenant, although they may not be. Often, you will find that subtenants will be paying more rent to the primary tenant than the total amount payable to the state or territory housing authority. That is clearly a case of double subsidisation by the Commonwealth for people living in public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subtenants will not be affected by this measure if they live in public housing where market or unsubsidised rent is being charged. In these circumstances, there would be no element of double subsidisation. Those are the reasons that the government has seen fit to take the action that we have been taking; therefore, we could not support the opposition amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that my department has been doing a considerable amount of work over recent months with the state housing authorities, which are also concerned at what they believe is a fairly substantial level of non-reporting of additional income in a household. The two levels of government have been trying to work together on that issue. There is also an issue for my department which has seen a degree of, shall I say, suspected&mdash;and I think in some cases it has been proven&mdash;misuse of receipts from one member of a household to another for rent that was not, in fact, paid but which enables, under the current arrangements, rent assistance to be paid by my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless these issues are able to be worked through at the state and the federal level, unless there is good cooperation between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those two levels of government, the taxpayer is the one who suffers. We believe that the right and proper thing is that people do declare the amount of household income. It then means only a very small increase in the rent charged to the public housing tenant, but it means that the affairs between the tenants and the state governments are on a more honest and open basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also would like to have the ability to be sure of that at the state level. Currently we are paying rent assistance to people who are, we believe, sometimes not even paying the rent. They are simply providing a rent receipt. I have that advice on a first-hand basis. I have talked to my regional officers around the country, and they have shown me rent receipts which they have found to be fraudulent. This is all part of that bigger picture, Senator.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and a few smaller disputes, unfortunately. There has been a whole range of other massive economic and social changes up until this time. Certainly the world was fundamentally a different place to live in 1901. But, just as the world has changed massively over the course of this century, so have the needs concerning financial management, accountability and auditing in the Commonwealth sector. This legislation seeks to modernise, streamline and improve the existing financial management framework, and is supported by the Labor opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the intrinsic merits of the legislation, the package of bills is supported because it is an initiative of the former Labor government. It is to the shame of this government that they have delayed the passage of the bills during this parliament. We have waited more than a year&mdash;it is 18 months&mdash;since they were elected to have them debated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators would be aware of the fairly tortuous history of this package. However, it is important to put on the public record the origin of the bills. It was Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 296 which suggested reform of the Audit Act. That was released in 1989. The then Labor government responded to this report in 1989, accepting inter alia this recommendation. The complex policy development and drafting process was completed and the legislation was introduced into the House in 1994. It was considered in detail by the JCPA, which issued its advisory report No. 331 in September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it was not possible to get agreement on the final design of the package&mdash;it is interesting how the wheels of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6971"> history turn in regard to this legislation. The now government, then opposition, indulged in what can only be described as the most monumentally opportunistic behaviour in the Senate. As a result, the legislation lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. It is this opportunistic behaviour by the now government that I wish to make some comments about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) wrote to the new chair of the JCPA, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), on 12 August 1996 requesting that the JCPA consider how the functional independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General could be improved in the context of the government finalising the details of this package of legislation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This resulted in JCPA report No. 346 being issued in October 1996&mdash;about 150 reports later we got another report. The now government introduced the bills on 12 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising but it is disappointing that the current government has changed many of the positions that it vigorously argued here in the Senate&mdash;and in the House, of course, but certainly in the Senate, as I recall&mdash;when it was in opposition. They have suddenly seen the wisdom of Labor's proposals, yet they have not had the decency to acknowledge this. I will return to some examples of this later in my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to financial management, there are two different categories of entity within the Commonwealth sector. Either a body has the legal capacity in its own right to acquire ownership of assets, including money, or it may function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity of the Commonwealth. Whether a body falls into a particular category is dependent upon the legislation which establishes it. The legislation package consolidates the regulatory accountability framework of each of these two categories into separate bills. Literally, the  Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996  applies to those entities in the first category, and the  Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996  applies to the second category. The proposed bills will provide a modern, appropriate framework which specifies the responsibilities and powers necessary for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> efficient, effective and ethical use of resources available to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn broadly to the specific matters covered by each bill. The  Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996  maintains the central role of the finance minister in the functioning of the constitutional treasury of the Commonwealth. The minister retains the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and its investment. The current legislation is silent on the issue of management performance. The new FMA legislation seeks to place responsibility specifically on chief executives of agencies. The CEOs are to be required to manage their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically. They are required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Minister for Finance will also be able to request financial information more regularly than annually from agencies to ensure better supervisory standards. The chief executives are permitted to subdelegate to officials. This is designed to achieve a major strengthening of the financial framework. The rationale behind this is that the CEOs are better placed than the finance minister to manage the specific tasks of officials. The bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by Labor, and we are certainly not going to oppose that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the  Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 , Commonwealth authorities and companies are generally regulated by part XI of the Audit Act. Since this is to be repealed, replacement provisions are needed. Whilst most authorities are regulated under the Audit Act, only about two-thirds of these bodies are currently caught under the general legislation, with the rest having their own financial, reporting and auditing provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of many Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements in so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. The new bill proposes to replace these diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. Many of the requirements are modelled on comparable areas of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6972"> the Corporations Law as well as best practice applying to individual authorities. The standardisation is a major reform which should both strengthen and simplify the current regulatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by Labor, and we are certainly supporting it. The major change is the strengthening of the penalties applying to office holders of Commonwealth authorities and/or companies to include a civil penalty regime in addition to the criminal penalty regime. Labor supports this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now consider the  Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 . Whilst each piece of this legislation package is significant, the  Auditor&hyphen;General Bill  is the key element of the package. The mere existence of a separate Auditor-General bill is recognition of the unique position of the A-G in the constitutional, institutional arrangements of this nation. The unique position of the A-G arises because of the unique duties of the A-G, the unique responsibilities of that office, and the fundamental importance to effective and accountable democracy that a fearless, truly independent watchdog provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 8(1) of the bill proposes to designate the A-G as an `independent officer of the Parliament'. Labor has no problem with this approach. Indeed, we think it is appropriate to recognise the uniqueness of the position. But let it be clearly understood that this change is cosmetic and meaningless. Indeed, the following provision in the bill, subclause 8(2), specifically states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . There are no implied functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations arising from the Auditor-General being an independent officer of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the designation of the A-G is utterly meaningless in terms of the functions of the office. It is mere window dressing without any substance&mdash;like so many other policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority is a more substantial step towards ensuring the independence of the A-G. Currently, the ANAO exists as an administrative body only. It is, therefore, technically at the mercy of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> executive of the day and could be abolished at any time. With the passage of this legislation, that unsatisfactory state of affairs will have been ended and the ANAO will have the protection of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to government Liberal&hyphen;National Party hypocrisy. The bill contains numerous examples of where the government has displayed what could only be the most breathtaking hypocrisy whilst in opposition. There are a number of issues which were vital to the coalition before the last election, on which they have now been utterly exposed as opportunists because they have altered or completely reversed their previous positions. I find it hard to recall any package of legislation where I have seen such a number of U&hyphen;turns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present some examples. The Senate amended the Labor legislation to ensure that the A-G could not be appointed unless at least two&hyphen;thirds of the JCPA agreed with the appointment. The government's bill proposes that a simple majority should be necessary to agree to the appointment of the A-G. Obviously, the change to a majority vote of the JCPA keeps the power with the executive and, because the coalition have a majority on the JCPA, they will obviously do exactly what they are instructed to do by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate also amended the Labor legislation to allow for consultation between the A-G and the chair of the JCPA where the A-G wishes to suppress the disclosure of sensitive information. Clause 37 of the bill currently proposes that the A-G should not be allowed to disclose information if he or she is of the opinion disclosure would be contrary to the public interest or if the Attorney-General has issued a certificate to suppress the disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just imagine what would have happened if Labor had proposed this type of secrecy regime when in government. It would have been vigorously denounced by members of the present government, but now they are running mute on the issue, when they are proposing an absolute blanket of secrecy from an officer of the parliament to any member of parliament. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does have some concerns about this provision. Current government members were very keen to ensure that the Auditor&hyphen;General was able to conduct performance audits on Commonwealth GBEs or any of their subsidiaries and amended the 1994 bill in the Senate to that effect, except for the partly privatised GBEs. The current bill basically adopts Labor's model, which involves a request from either the Minister for Finance or the JCPA before a performance audit of a GBE can be undertaken. We agree with the proposal, but again I condemn the hypocrisy of the now government in opportunistically changing its views to agree with the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to reflect too much on the career of former Senator Jim Short, but I can recall his contributions in the areas that I have referred to today. If he were still in the Senate and still Assistant Treasurer, we would certainly be demanding that he come into this chamber and provide an explanation for his government's U&hyphen;turn, but he is currently examining the U&hyphen;turn of Eastern European economies in his new position with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and I wish him well in those new duties.</PARA>

He is fortunate not to be here today to explain the U&hyphen;turns in this legislation, given his public record in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . But enough of former Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final bill in the package contains the myriad consequential and transitional provisions which arise from a rewrite of the Audit Act. The major initiatives in this bill are the provisions which increase the role of the JCPA. The JCPA is to become the audit committee of the parliament. The JCPA's additional responsibilities will include considering and reporting on the operations and resources of the Australian National Audit Office, examining the draft budget of the ANAO and subsequent reporting of recommendations to the finance minister and both 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> houses of parliament, and determining the audit priorities of the parliament and advising the Auditor-General of those priorities. Labor has no objection to these proposals and we will be supporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my concluding remarks, I just state that this is very important legislation and Labor will be giving swift passage to it. The comprehensiveness and flexibility of the new provisions should provide a good framework for Commonwealth financial management well into the next century. It should have been a lot higher on the government's priority list, rather than being relegated to something that will be advanced almost 18 months after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Campbell is dealing with this legislation, and I would request that he at least make some attempt to explain the difference between his party's position now from when they were in opposition. I know it is very difficult to do. I know you have to explain why Senator Short put a totally different position some time ago and why you have reversed that position today, but we would like some attempt from you to explain the number of U&hyphen;turns, the reasons for the U-turns and the monumental hypocrisy that the government is now displaying.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few bills in this place have had a longer history than these particular bills. They represent an essential reform. I am pleased they finally made it to the Senate and I want to congratulate the government for bringing them forward. The four bills in front of us will replace the Audit Act 1901, which was amongst the very first acts of the new federal parliament after Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have strongly supported this overhaul of the audit bills. We have long supported a strong and active mandate for the Commonwealth Auditor-General and for all auditors-general. Accountability is essential to democracy, but we must recognise that accountability does have a cost, and that cost includes a range of measures to ensure that all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6974"> spending of the government is legal, authorised, efficient, transparent, open and honest. That is why we have an audit office and why this package of bills is so long overdue.</PARA>

The government's attitude to financial accountability after 18 months in power can be contrasted with the previous government, which took five years to develop a package of audit bills. Even then, the draft Labor legislation was a poor replacement, we thought, for the original set of bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the determined intervention of the Democrats in 1994, following the outrageous lack of accountability by then minister Ros Kelly in the sports rorts affair, that forced the government to revise its auditing approach, rejig this package and provide a proper and comprehensive mandate for the Auditor-General. I should note and approve the contribution of the then finance minister, Kim Beazley, in moving quickly to improve the legislative package and the financial accountability measures then in place. I should also note and approve the strident defence of the role of the audit office by the then Auditor-General, John Taylor, who publicly reiterated the importance to our democracy and all democracies of proper accountability regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even then, the Labor government, when this package of bills was last before the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate in 1995, refused to agree to a range of amendments moved by the Democrats and the coalition designed to close the gaps still left in the Auditor-General's mandate. I would like to particularly acknowledge the resource of Senator Cheryl Kernot and Senator Brian Gibson in working to improve the legislation at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that, in the resurrected legislation before us, the government has accepted the vast bulk of the amendments pursued by the Democrats and the coalition two years ago. I am disappointed that the coalition has changed its mind on the importance of ensuring that the Auditor is able to report fully to parliament and not be restricted by executive interference. This was an important issue in the 1995 debate and has been again identified by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as a vital issue. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill to ensure that the Auditor&hyphen;General does preserve a full mandate to report to parliament on financial accountability issues and be unrestrained by ministerial executive interference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this package of bills does have a very long history. It dates back to a 1989 Public Accounts Committee inquiry into the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General. That inquiry found that the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General was understaffed, subject to unnecessary interference by the executive arm of government and needed stronger legislation and parliamentary support. This call seemed to be ignored for many years, despite repeated calls from the Auditor-General for a stronger statement of his role as a servant of the parliament and for adequate funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took the dramatic events surrounding the Ros Kelly sports rorts affair for Senator Cheryl Kernot and the Democrats to break open the log jam holding up the bill and set these bills on the path of providing a more comprehensive mandate for the Auditor-General to audit all government departments, authorities and business enterprises. Once again, the role of the coalition in advancing this cause is much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is provided for in the new  Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 . But the mandate of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6975"> Auditor-General has been expanded in this bill as opposed to the 1995 bill, picking up issues raised by the Democrats, the coalition and others in 1995. These include strengthening the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament by establishing the Joint Committee of Public Accounts as the audit committee of parliament, with a role in setting the audit priorities of the audit office and with the ability to direct the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises; extending the term of the Auditor-General to 10 years and giving the Joint Committee of Public Accounts a say in the appointment process through a veto right on the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General; confirming that the Auditor-General has unfettered access to intelligence and security agencies reports and matters of confidentiality; and strengthening the Auditor-General's position with regard to the potential for unwarranted interference by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats particularly welcome the changes to the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to establish it as an audit committee of parliament. The establishment of an audit committee of parliament was first recommended by the JCPA in 1989 and has long been supported by the Auditor-General to better reflect the role of the Auditor as the servant of the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the Democrats' accountability measures agreed to with the previous government in 1994, the former government moved to establish an audit committee by resolution. It was our view that the function of the audit committee should be reflected in legislation, which was one of the items of disagreement in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that not just has the JCPA formally been given an audit oversight role in this legislation, but the Public Accounts Committee Act is to be amended to expand the number of senators on the committee by one, to be filled according to the practice of the Senate. What that means to us is that a senator from the crossbenches will be appointed to the JCPA, thereby reducing the government majority on that committee. I note, however, Senator Sherry's caution on the committee structure, and I look forward to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hearing his views on that in the committee stage of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, the biggest disappointment in this 1997 bill is clause 37, which does have the effect of unilaterally and absolutely restricting the ability of the Auditor-General to report to parliament if the Attorney-General certifies that the matter is sensitive. The list of reasons for what is sensitive is simply too long, and the power of the Attorney-General&mdash;a politician&mdash;to nobble the Auditor&hyphen;Generals' reporting to parliament is absolute. In particular, clause 37 could be used to prevent the Auditor-General reporting on Commonwealth-state financial relations on any matter involving contracting out, tendering, government business enterprises, payments to private companies or on the basis that the information may `unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 37(3) then goes on to limit the privileges of the Senate by stating that the Auditor-General cannot be compelled by parliament to override the Attorney-General's direction. This device will allow governments to avoid public scrutiny of potentially all of their relations with the private sector and prevent any embarrassing little shady deals or improper actions coming to public light. For the Senate to allow such a provision to pass into law would be an absolute outrage and a travesty of accountability, and I for one will mark very carefully the actions of the Labor Party when that matter comes to debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The finance department, through the current government as it did through the former government, argues that this provision largely replicates subsection 48(5) of the current Audit Act. The department claims that this provision has not been controversial and that no certificate under those provisions has ever been issued&mdash;in which case, why do we need it? That may be the case, but the level of contracting out, of commercialisation of government services, of tendering for government services and of general commercial relations between the government and the private sector has risen dramatically in the last three years under competition policy reforms, particularly since the change of government. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6976"> This provision, we believe, is now a potentially massive hole in the accountability regime, and it could easily be used to avoid scrutiny on a wide range of deals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a provision that the government is suggesting in this act would have prevented any public reporting of any audit reports on WA Inc. style deals within the government sector. As a Western Australian, I am well aware how often the commercial-in-confidence and the secrecy defence was wheeled out in parliament during those debates. It is disgraceful, disgusting and unacceptable to lack that kind of accountability. Once again I say to Labor, `Be careful that you don't let something through in the idea that you might end up in government yourselves and want to participate in that kind of larking.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely disappointed by the coalition's backflip in government on this issue. In 1995, Senator Brian Gibson and Senator Jim Short were very strong opponents of these restrictions to the parliament's powers to receive reports, and I will be interested to see whether Senator Gibson turns up in the committee stage later on. There are senators from all sides of the chamber, including the major parties, who are very disturbed indeed about clause 37.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will also be making a financial accountability amendment to the  Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996 . The Democrats recently proposed amendments to the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997  which were designed to have the effect of guaranteeing accountability through an independent Auditor&hyphen;General to the public of Victoria, and to the public of all the states and territories. Those amendments were designed to maintain what we regard as the desirable status quo in terms of safeguarding the independent auditing functions currently in place in the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, despite strong support in some sections of the party, wimped out on our amendment despite indicating in the debate how uncomfortable they were with the Victorian review of the Audit Act, and the consequential diminution of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General's position. They also indicat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed how uncomfortable they were with the removal of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General's direct control over his department, and the ramifications of this change in terms of public accountability. But their executive side got the better of them, and they overturned our amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Senator Sherry indicated during that debate that the Labor Party would support such an amendment to this package of audit legislation. I regard it as second best, and I do not regard it as an appropriate way to amend this set of bills. I am looking forward to seeing if they adhere to that undertaking when I put up that amendment to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that the Auditor&hyphen;General has the full powers to investigate and report on all commercial dealings involving government money. To allow a member of the cabinet to prevent him reporting on such matters must be vigorously and stridently denied by any member of the Senate who believes that government accountability is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, Minister, I again congratulate you and your government on presenting this package of bills to the parliament. We are delighted to see it before us. Our amendments will be relatively few and will all focus on accountability and the few issues you know are dear to our hearts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) agreed to the second reading debate on this package of bills being held at lunchtime today because there has certainly been movement towards addressing a number of those controversial issues. Also, there is no doubt that it is an issue which has been canvassed on a number of other occasions. So we are not dealing with a new package of bills for which there has been no debate in this chamber before. That is why we are prepared to make an exception, and it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6977"> should not be seen as a precedent for other packages of otherwise highly controversial bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we are all aware, this package of bills is designed to replace the Audit Act 1901, and it flowed from the previous government's response to the 1989 Joint Committee of Public Accounts report on the Auditor&hyphen;General entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor&hyphen;General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS>. It is an important reform and, in a similar vein to the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996  which we have just debated, provides a framework that facilitates proper scrutiny of government decisions and procedures. This could be even more important than it has been in the past, as we are moving towards greater outsourcing and competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have concerns in three broad areas: the ability to scrutinise the activities of government business enterprises; the need for Commonwealth authorities and companies to have some form of requirement that they act in the public interest; and, finally, the very important question of parliamentary committees having access to organisations in receipt of money appropriated by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will remember that we have just recently debated a package of bills in relation to the Productivity Commission. That was voted down by the Senate. But one of the issues that came up in that debate was competitive tendering and competitive neutrality. That means that, in effect, there will be money going to the private sector for providing services. Taxpayers' money will be used to provide certain services to a whole range of areas which have not been provided with those services before. There will be budget allocations going out to the private sector in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of whether the Auditor&hyphen;General has the ability to conduct a general performance audit of a government business enterprise as part of a general examination of a whole or part of the public sector at any time without needing any prior approval is, I believe, absolutely crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that this parliament must have absolute faith in the ability of the Auditor&hyphen;General to act appropriately. It must 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide the Auditor&hyphen;General with the independence and framework that facilitates the proper independent auditing of government business enterprises, as well as Commonwealth companies and authorities, particularly in the context of broader sectoral examination. As a consequence, I will be moving an amendment to clause 18 of the  Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996  to eliminate the current exclusion in respect of government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the ability of the Auditor&hyphen;General to conduct a performance audit of a government business enterprise, I am prepared to accept the qualification in clause 16(2) and clause 17(2), which give the Joint Committee of Public Accounts an audit role in requesting audits. I will, however, be watching the operation of these sections with interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As indicated earlier, I am also keen to see that Commonwealth authorities and companies are required to act in the public interest. The definition I have incorporated in the  Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996  is an adaptation of a definition I have attempted to incorporate in the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill and the competition policy reform bills. I believe it is fundamentally important that legislation which provides the broad framework in which the public sector operates should incorporate a broad requirement to act in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to be reminded that issues such as equity, efficiency, ecological sustainability and regional concerns have a crucial impact on the daily lives of Australians, and that those who determine and interpret public policy must act consistently with those overriding principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I will be moving a second reading amendment which reaffirms the right of parliamentary committees to require representatives of a body in receipt of money appropriated by the parliament, or subject to any direction or control by the Commonwealth, to appear before those committees. As other senators will be aware, I have been concerned about this issue for some time, and I feel it is important that such an amendment reaffirming 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6978"> the rights of parliamentary committees is passed by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of occasions&mdash;and the example of Australian Defence Industries springs to mind&mdash;where, basically, we have had very severe restrictions placed on the committee as to what they can do and what they can ask, and the bodies themselves choosing what they are asked, with a very wide&hyphen;ranging and broad cover under commercial in confidence. Obviously, this also ought to be considered. I urge the support of the Senate for my amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add `and the Senate declares that, in spite of anything contained in these bills, it expects and requires ministers to ensure that, as far as practicable, when senators request representatives of a body in receipt of money appropriated by the Parliament or subject to any direction or control by the Commonwealth, to attend before any committee considering estimates or annual reports, such representatives will attend as requested'.</PARA></SPEECH>

I know those who have been associated with these bills have been very keen to progress them through the Senate and it is genuinely an historic day in the Senate that this is now happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray did give us a bit of a brickbat, saying that perhaps we had been a little tardy in not bringing them on before this session. I say to Senator Murray that the government had listed them for debate at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> end of the last session and, from memory, possibly even the session before that. Indeed, to get this package through, we had negotiated with other parties in this place to sit for an extra four or five hours on the last Thursday night at the end of the last session. I had the agreement of quite a large number of senators, including Senator Kernot, to do just that but in the event we were not able to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President; Senator Evans, we did take a long time on one particular bill at the end of 1993. However, we took a very long time on that bill after all of the other government legislation had been dealt with and set an extra five days to do so. There may have been one or two other bills in 13 years where we did that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, that in the first 12 months of this government's term, the Senate took 100 hours to deal with two bills: the  Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 , more commonly known as the workplace relations legislation, and Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership Bill 1996). It took 100 hours&mdash;the equivalent of nearly 10 sitting days&mdash;to deal with two bills. I feel quite sure that we could have had a constructive debate on a range of other packages of bills if we had been a little more sensible about allocating time. I reiterate a plea I made in a speech outside this place: if senators, particularly leaders and whips of parties, could come together and agree to allocate sensible amounts of time&mdash;and even generous amounts of time&mdash;to packages of bills, you could end up dealing with a lot more legislation. Definitely, if that had applied prior, the audit package of bills would have passed into law many months ago. At the committee stage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6979"> of the bills&mdash;which looks likely to be the next day of sitting&mdash;I will deal with clause 37 and some of the points that Senator Murray made, in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some contrast&mdash;and Senator Margetts made the point in her contribution, although I do not think she was making the same point&mdash;when we were dealing with the package of legislation in relation to the Productivity Commission, the legislation failed at the third reading on this issue of the right of small business people, or business people in general, to bring a complaint about competitive neutrality before that body. That was one of the core issues for some senators. We needed only one more vote and we would have had the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do find it somewhat ironical that the Democrats are saying to the business community, `Look; you can't have a complaints mechanism if you think that a Commonwealth government business entity is competing against you unfairly. We think that that is unfair on the Commonwealth government business enterprise' and then come along here and say that the Commonwealth should be able to compete against business, even if it is unfairly, and also ensure that the Commonwealth can make a report about a commercial operation which would confer&mdash;and I think these are the words of the legislation or the amendment&mdash;`unfair commercial damage.' Perhaps it is not ironical; perhaps it is, in fact, consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is trying to protect private businesses&mdash;often small businesses run by families&mdash;from unfair intrusion by `big brother'. We think that in the productivity commission legislation small business should be able to complain if they believe they are being unfairly competed against by one of the big brother government's business enterprises, but the Democrats have said no to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also think it is unfair that a Commonwealth government, or the Auditor&hyphen;General in this case, should cause to be published a report that would create unfair commercial damage. That matter will be debated in the committee stage, hopefully on the next day of sitting. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by thanking the many senators&mdash;both those in the Senate now and those who have left; this matter has gone virtually over a generation&mdash;for the contributions they have made. It has been an eight&hyphen;year process to get this legislation into the Senate. Members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts have made a tremendous contribution over that period. Ros Kelly has already been thanked for her contribution in seeing this package come forward. We thank Mrs Kelly again. We do thank all senators and you, Senator Margetts in particular, for agreeing to have this second reading debate during lunch time, which has allowed the package to be dealt with more speedily, using up time that otherwise would have been spent eating our sandwiches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, I note that you have distributed a second reading amendment. The government's view on that is that we believe that the Senate has appropriate powers&mdash;some would say very important powers&mdash;to call before it people in these categories. This amendment certainly would not add or detract from those powers and so the government will not be supporting it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Madam President, I thank Senator Synon for that important question. Good news, of course, is of interest to all Australians with the possible sole exception of the Labor Party. Every time good news is reported, faces fall: you can almost hear it over here, I have to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Madam President, to Senator Synon, the ABS business expectation survey paints a very good picture of the economic outlook. Expectations for the year ahead for sales growth, profits and capital expenditure and employment have all strengthened since the previous survey in June. Sales are expected to go three per cent in the December quarter, the highest rate since December 1993. Profit growth is expected to be strong, with profits expected to rise by 21 per cent by September next year. A 6.2 per cent rise is expected in capital investment in the December quarter&mdash;another very important measure&mdash;which is the largest expected rise since December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also released today were ABS job vacancy data and DEETYA skill vacancy data. In trend terms, ABS job vacancies are at 63,900, the highest level since August 1989, and the DEETYA series also rose in trend terms for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the fourth consecutive month. Over the year it is up roughly 5.7 per cent. The job vacancies indicate employment growth in the coming months, which I think is very good news for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also point to the fact that bond yields are at their lowest level since a generation ago. That was truly a great achievement and one which I think will be applauded as well. With the lowest home mortgage rates since the late 1960s and the lowest small business rates in a quarter of a century, the Howard government is delivering for the battlers&mdash;and that is what we are here for. We are delivering. We are not talking about it; we are delivering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I think we can point to the fact that the government's record over the last 18 months is extremely good and, I believe, will be applauded by most Australians&mdash;again with the exception of the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important decision because it ensures that, when consumers and end users are interested in changing carriers, they will be able to take their telephone numbers with them. This is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6982"> the first time that number portability has been determined in this country. We have announced that as a licence condition imposed on Telstra, if by 1 May next year there has not been agreement reached between the parties&mdash;that is, Telstra and Optus&mdash;as to the appropriate level of remuneration that should pass between them, the terms recommended by Austel in its final review released publicly just before the close of the financial year, and, indeed, prior to its going out of existence, will be imposed on Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very good news for consumers. It will provide a major boost to competition. It will inevitably provide more flexibility for customers wanting to shop around. We have followed all of the proper processes, and that is why I think the question asked by Senator Tierney is very important&mdash;that is, whether this is well understood by all the major stakeholders. There is one in particular who has a very serious level of difficulty in understanding the true nature of this decision, and that is the representative of disgruntled unionists, presumably their candidate at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht put out a press release on local number portability in which he said that our decision would be `a major boost to competition'. He got that dead right but, unfortunately, it is all downhill after that. If you look at his press release, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister has been excessively slow in dealing with this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Two paragraphs later, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is surprising that such difficult legal decisions appear to have been made so quickly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Telstra's Registration Statement filed with the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission last week makes no mention of the new licence condition or its financial impacts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that it was axiomatic that a decision that was made only this week could not have been contained in a document filed last week. Senator Schacht, you do not want to hear it. I know. Get back into the sandpit. Tune out. Listen to the House of Representatives. Do everything you can to avoid learning, but it is about time you faced up to the fact that you cannot even put two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words together in a press release. How do you expect to be taken seriously? You talk about the `US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission'&mdash;no such animal. It is the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's registration statement is the first of two preliminary documents. The first one, filed last week, is actually a pink herring. I know you are in the business of red herrings because the rest of this press release is all about red herrings. You will have to wait a bit longer before they actually file the red herring, and you will have to wait even longer&mdash;until you get to the end of the float process&mdash;before they file the final document. It is on that basis that people will take into account the impacts on Telstra of these sorts of announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht seems to think that you should not be doing anything in the lead&hyphen;up to the float process without understanding that there is an obligation to actually disclose issues that might be material to the value of Telstra. So to put out a press release along these lines of saying: `I do not believe the minister has solved the complicated problem by imposing a licence condition. Clearly the achievement of number portability involves action by more than one party,' again, shows a fundamental misunderstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have imposed interim arrangements pending agreement and, in default of the agreement, determination by arbitration by the ACCC. Of course, this only applies to Optus and Telstra. So, in due course, they will both come to an agreement to the extent that, if Optus customers want to access Telstra and vice versa, that will emerge under the new competitive regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that Senator Schacht did not, once again, come and ask for some help. We were more than happy to provide it. All I can say is, `Back to kindergarten.'

Minister, can you confirm that since 1 July this year health care cards have included a code which identifies which social security payment a person is receiving? Do you think it is appropriate for any member of the general public&mdash;for example, the chemist who is dispensing their prescription&mdash;to know whether a person is unemployed or a widow? Does the Privacy Commissioner agree with this blanket release of personal information when, in fact, the card need only identify sickness allowees so that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gibbs may or may not be aware of the fact that there have been over a number of years real troubles with the administration of health cards of one kind or another. It had got to the stage where when we came into government there was criticism from the people who were supposed to be receiving the cards because they were getting duplicate copies or quadruplicate copies, and also from chemists saying that there was no effective way of knowing whether a card was still current or not. As a result, I know that the Department of Social Security last year did a review of what we should be doing about cards generally. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall that we reduced the number of cards from four to three, which was an exercise in simplicity. Also the department was trying to produce better cards that would pass the test of time in usage, that they would not disintegrate, as people have had those problems too. I do not know whether the Privacy Commissioner was consulted. I certainly will ask that. I would expect that the Privacy Commissioner would have been consulted because Social Security has been meticulous over a number of years in consulting with the Privacy Commissioner on any new moves. I hope and trust that that has happened on this occasion. I would be very happy to get that information and bring it to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure you would agree that an efficiently managed card system is very important to those on low incomes who are getting income support from the Department of Social Security and who have an eligibility for a card, and that it is delivered to them efficiently, does not breach their privacy and is useful for the purpose for which it is intended. The taxpayer also has an interest to make sure that cards are not usable beyond the eligibility date. That has been a continuing problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the department has done a lot of work in trying to improve the systems to prevent multiple release of cards. They also have contracts with private firms to improve on the printing. I know they have had some troubles in that area, but there has been a

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Lees for the question. There is no doubt that tobacco smoking is a great scourge affecting this country. As I am sure most members know, the government embarked on a $7 million national tobacco campaign to advertise the deleterious effect of tobacco smoke and the fact that so many thousands die each year as a result of cigarette smoking. I know that Senator Lees has a very keen interest in this, as we were members together of a community affairs committee that looked at this problem for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is involved in that campaign, as you know. The campaign is the first truly national collaborative Quit Smoking health initiative between federal, state and territory governments and non&hyphen;government organisations. This is the first time all have come together on this scale in a campaign to reduce smoking. The Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the divisions of general practice, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Pharmacy Guild, the Australian Cancer Society, the National Health Foundation, the Quit organisations across Australia and the National Asthma Campaign have all pledged their support and contribution to the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am greatly encouraged by early indications from the tracking surveys that the campaign is a success, having generated a very high awareness of its advertisements, stimulated significant discussion about its smoking and health message and prompted more than 35,000 calls to the national Quit telephone hotline which provides information and counselling services for smokers. Among people who recalled health advertising&mdash;54 per cent of all respondents surveyed&mdash;31 per cent described smoking advertising prior to the campaign, 62 per cent in the first three weeks after the launch and 54 per cent for the next four weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it is in the interests of this country to diminish the amount of cigarette smoking that occurs in the community and all actions that can be taken in that regard are being looked at by the minister and by the department because, as the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs showed in its investigation, the economic advantages to this country far outweigh the possible economic return from taxation and the various things that occur. That fact is not well known and is, of course, significantly denigrated by the tobacco industry of this country.</PARA>

While the campaign is of great interest, the people who are actually launching this class action are virtually all those groups you mentioned as supporting the campaign. Wouldn't it be great if, rather than us having to fund that campaign, it was

So I ask: when you go to the minister, if the answer is still no, they will not support the legal aid application, what does this government intend to do to compel the tobacco companies to come to the table and admit, as they have done in the United States, that their product is harmful, it is addictive and it kills?

Minister, yesterday at your extravagant launch of Centrelink, the Prime Minister said, `The board of Centrelink includes private sector members with extensive experience in the establishment of customer service networks.' Is it not the case that three of the six Centrelink board members have direct links with the financial sector and particularly banks: Ms Gillies from the Bank of Melbourne; Mr Pearce from Rothschilds and Sons investment bank; and Mr Thame, the ex&hyphen;Managing Director of Advance Bank? Is it not the case that Centrelink will make 159 million payments estimated to be worth almost $51 billion in 1997&hyphen;98, most of them by electronic transfers to financial institutions including banks? Is this not already a conflict of interest? How will the board deal with

I am very sorry for them. It has been really quite opportune for them to see what a stupid opposition we have and to realise the difficulties that a government has to operate under when you have an opposition that is not in the least interested in policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, now known as Centrelink, is a huge organisation, making the 159 million payments that you referred to, and spending about one&hyphen;third of the federal budget. That is the enormity of the task that has been given to them. It involves good administration, a good background in administration, an understanding of information technology, an understanding of the need to change a culture so that it is very much more customer focused than it has been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to you in that regard the criticisms made yesterday in the report by the Ombudsman. I would have thought the opposition might have asked questions about that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Senator Alston. Minister, has your attention been drawn to a survey by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants which shows that Australian small businesses will have to pay more than $30 million in extra costs to collect the 15 per cent tax on superannuation? Can you also confirm that the survey revealed that the cost of collecting the tax would increase charges by at least $100 for each small fund member? Is it a fact that half the accountants surveyed said that they would need to increase their fees to clients as a result of complying with the tax? How do you reconcile these developments with your government's professed commitment to reducing small business compliance costs and to cutting red tape?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the Honourable Senator's question, I am advised that the survey commissioned by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants used a sample of only 376 registered accountants, a very small representation from the 67,000 accountants and tax professionals in Australia. Therefore, the Government would be unwise to rely on these results as indicative of the views of the wider small business community and its advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figure of $30 million referred to by the Senator was an extrapolation calculated by the Society. It was based on the survey finding that 50 per cent of the registered accountants surveyed (ie. 188 of the 376 surveyed) believed that administering the surcharge on behalf of their clients would result in client fees having to be increased by $100 per superannuation fund member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it must be recognised that 42% of the survey respondents believed that their fees would remain the same, 2% believed their fees would be reduced, and 6% said "don't know".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These results clearly show that there is a wide divergence of opinion on this matter even within the small group of accountants surveyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to reducing small business compliance costs and cutting red tape.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to questions without notice asked by Senators Neal and Crowley today, relating to government programs aimed at women.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I asked the minister about the abolition of a women's bureau within the organisation known as the social policy and cross-sectoral branch of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I do not know whether the minister intentionally misunderstood my question or whether she was being mischievous in the way she responded to the question. Very clearly, the women's bureau does not exist, and any statement that this bureau still does exist&mdash;if she intended it to be construed that way&mdash;was completely and utterly incorrect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally the women's bureau was set up during the time of the Menzies government. It is rather amusing for those of us on this side of the Senate to know that this particular government in the late 1990s, close to the turn of the century, has a more traditional and less generous view of women than the Menzies government, which has become a symbol of conservatism and a symbol of putting forward policies that would have women return to the home and not be treated as equals in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you see in the 1990s a government taking these sorts of steps&mdash;doing away with a bureau that was originally put in place in the 1950s to ensure that women were not disadvantaged within employment and education&mdash;it really does give a pretty strong indication of this government's view of women and their role in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel very sorry for those women who are members of the government who obviously have quite a contrary view. I have to say that I know Senator Coonan and Senator Payne are amongst those, and I hope they will get up and put forward their alternative view later on today. Certainly the view that is being put by this government, as represented by Senator Newman, is not the view that most people in Australia expect. Certainly it is not the view of Australian women. Women still believe that they should be able to go to work if they choose, and they should not be discouraged. They should not be encouraged to remain solely in the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude that Senator Newman is displaying in her lack of concern for the abolition of the Women's Bureau is not restricted to just the internal machinations of the government's bureaucracy. As we are all aware, it is reflected much more broadly. It was only recently, after intense pressure from the backbench, that this government reversed its decision to abolish the position of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner within HREOC. There has also been very severe criticism by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women within the United Nations for the way that this government's policies have changed to adversely affect women in the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been very well highlighted in a recent survey released that the $820 million that has been cut from child care in the last two years has had a very severe effect on women and also their families, the children that they are caring for. In fact, the National Association of Community Based Children's Services report said that 4,000 families have taken their children out of child-care services in the last three months. Of those who have left, 74 per cent of those people have reported that the escalating costs were the reason that they left. The additional, on average, $18 a week that parents are being forced to pay to have their children in child care is making it impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In most cases, those families who leave formal care put their children into informal care. In fact, 67 per cent of parents who leave child care because of these financial reasons are putting their children into backyard care. Not only is that occurring but, if you are a woman at work and you cannot afford to have your children cared for in child care, you often have to give up your job entirely or reduce the hours that you work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ironic that Senator Neal should choose this particular time to make her comments in relation to the work of the government and women in Australia. It is ironic for a number of reasons. Firstly, this is the centenary year of the birth of Dame Enid Lyons, who, I might remind the Senate, was the first woman elected to the Australian federal parliament and, as a Liberal, the first woman cabinet minister. It is no accident that Dame Enid Lyons was, in fact, a Liberal because the Liberal Party has always stood for merit and the principle of equal opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Merit brings me to an interesting and telling point&mdash;telling in that, even after the adoption of the ALP's quota system several years ago now, this week saw the swearing in of two new male ALP senators. With all due respect to those gentlemen, in the same circumstances, the Liberal Party has managed to replace, of three senators in this past six months, two with women&mdash;humbly, might I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, on merit and without the need for a quota system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than accepting the criticisms of Senator Neal, I will make reference to some of the historical notes which she glossed over. It was the Menzies Liberal government that delivered child endowment in this country, national divorce laws, a medical benefits scheme, a national health scheme and tax concessions for married pensioners. It was in the Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments that the Liberal Party delivered assistance to wives who had been deserted, lifted the Commonwealth Public Service marriage bar, introduced equal pay legislation and the Child Care Act in 1972. It was the Fraser government that introduced the new family allowance system with payments made directly to mothers and established the Office of Child Care, the National Women's Advisory Council and the Institute of Family Studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government's commitment to women is all about giving women choice&mdash;choice in what they wish to do with their lives. The Howard government has funded growth in child-care places. It has taken a child-care program that was out of control. It was oversupplied in some areas while families elsewhere had little or no access to the child care that they needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making vast improvements to the child-care program in this nation, we are providing more equitable access to child-care places for families. We are addressing the legitimate concerns raised by Australian families and the child-care industry in extensive consultations, and we have addressed the unregulated growth of the industry of the last six years. What the child-care program now does is target working families and low and middle income families. Far from cutting child care, we have funded 83,000 new child-care places over the next four years. These places are located in areas of greatest need, especially rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has introduced the family tax incentive, which provides an extra $34 per fortnight for battling families, and rebates for private health insurance, which makes families $450 a year better off. We have introduced the parenting payment to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6996"> ensure people with children moving from single to couple households, or vice versa, are not disadvantaged. The enshrining of pension entitlements at 25 per cent of male weekly earnings is an important safeguard for women, and the government is treating the income security needs of older women as a policy priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of choice, our commitment to women in the work force is as important as our commitment to women outside the work force. The Workplace Relations Act makes permanent part-time work and family flexible working arrangements legally possible and provides all the necessary protections. It is our goal to provide women with greater choice. We do not believe in patronising quotas, but we do believe in effective anti-discrimination laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very glad that Senator Neal chose to raise this matter during her few words. That is why we have retained and will expand the role of the Sex Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Commissioner in the restructured human rights and responsibilities commission. We send a message from this that is self&hyphen;evident: we do respect the rights of women to be treated equally and fairly, whether in the workplace or elsewhere. We are making it safer and fairer for women in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisive ban on semi&hyphen;automatic weapons enhances the safety of women. I think that even the opposition would not quibble with that point. Later this year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be holding a domestic violence summit in conjunction with all state and territory governments. Our determination is to take a united stand against this abhorrent crime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not for me to be a nitpicker, Senator Payne, but you ought to check the facts about Dame Enid Lyons.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned to do today is to take note, as you did not, of the answers by Senator Newman to two questions. Both those answers indicate very importantly the insufficiency of Senator Newman's actions in protecting women's rights in this government. Minister Newman, when asked had she been  consulted about the proposed abolishment of the women's bureau in DEETYA, said, `Well, my department did.' That department did, but clearly the answer&mdash;not said, but hanging in the air&mdash;is `No', with a very big capital `N'. No, Senator Newman was not consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week or so ago I asked Senator Newman why the Prime Minister's women in sport awards had been abolished and whether she had been consulted. She talked about everything except sport, and the answer once again was no; no, this minister was not consulted. No, there is no reason those awards are not continuing, except that this government wants to abolish them. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women knew nothing about it and was therefore totally unable to protect the needs of women, sporting women, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today it is quite clear, according to the minister's own claim&mdash;and this will be checked&mdash;that apparently nobody has told her what a certain Queensland MP has been saying about domestic violence. I have here some 10 or more pages of copious references and comments by that aforementioned person in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Some of the points that I alluded to in my question are spelled out here in much greater length by that MP, making an absolute nonsense of Senator Newman's answer. If she does not know it, she should; if she does not know it, why not? Who is failing to draw these matters to her attention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I totally accept Senator Newman's statement that she personally is opposed to domestic violence. She has had a long history of that. Indeed, I believe she was one of the people involved in founding a women's shelter in Launceston, I think&mdash;I am not sure. I know it was in Tasmania. I have nothing against Senator Newman's personal involvement in and commitment to the abolition of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6997"> domestic violence. That was not the question. This side of parliament will not be distracted from the main game by Senator Newman trying to obfuscate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. The question is: if she is concerned to be the minister running the campaign for government to abolish domestic violence, why is it that no&hyphen;one has drawn to her attention what is widely known throughout the community&mdash;these disgraceful and shocking remarks about domestic violence and child abuse by one of her parliamentary colleagues? Where has she been? If she has not been given this advice, who has failed to give it to her? She is the minister and she is being overlooked. She was not consulted about the abolition of the women's desk in DEETYA, she was not consulted about the abolition of the women in sport awards and apparently she was not told that one of her own parliamentary colleagues was speaking most disgracefully about domestic violence and child abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of assistance is she providing on behalf of the women of Australia? I do not want a list of the things that may or may not have been done, all of which could be argued. From our point of view, we totally disagree with Senator Payne's assessment of all those things, for example, her claim that the industrial relations changes protect women. What do you make of legislation that has removed the commitment to equal pay for women? Forget about anything else: it removed the commitment to equal pay for women. Why? What good is that to women? Absolutely none, and yet that is what Senator Payne would argue is an example of this government's commitment on behalf of women. It is a splendid illustration of just what is concerning us and why, in the light of what this minister, Senator Newman, is not being consulted about&mdash;according to her own report&mdash;we are so concerned on behalf of the women of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have read any newspapers in the last few days you will have seen how upset and angry are the women and the families of Australia who can no longer attend their child&hyphen;care centres because they are closed or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the cost of that child care has gone through the roof. That is what the women of Australia are saying. Many of those women who work in child&hyphen;care centres have now lost their jobs specifically because of the decisions by this government. Choice indeed! You have got one choice: out of the work force and onto the unemployment list. Many of those women are older women. As of last Saturday they have to use up their superannuation, their very modest amounts of superannuation, before they can even claim any assistance through unemployment benefits. This minister reckons she is representing the women of Australia.

That was all done, as has already been said, on merit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things I wish to touch on in regard to that matter, but I want to move to the Workplace Relations Act, which makes permanent part&hyphen;time work and family flexible working arrangements legally possible and provides all the necessary protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember, as Senator Jacinta Collins will, when we tore around Australia in 17 days, the opposition that you people raised to this, and how you had your lackeys running in one after the other saying, `Oh, we don't want any of that. We won't have a bar of that.' This was one of the greatest incentives for women ever put into legislation in this place. Never forget that it gave them equal opportunity and maximum flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other aspects that I could deal with, but I just want to touch on one from Senator Neal, where she made reference to the fact that the backbench did something or other in our party room. It was a very strange reference, because in the time of the previous government the backbench did nothing. They were dictated to by two Prime Ministers, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. The one person who stood up and tried to argue some of the issues was Graeme Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie. What did you do? You booted him out. You got rid of him. You could not stand a bit of competition. You could not stand someone in the party room arguing the case. That is the way your party behaves.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us go back again and look at the actual issues that were raised in the questions. The issues go to the heart of what role Senator Newman plays as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. I think that that is very much the heart of the questions that were raised. How that role is being conducted is quite concerning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Senator Newman knew nothing of the broad comments that have been made with respect to a member of the House of Representatives in Queensland is, in my mind, astonishing, particularly given some of the media reports about how backbench Liberal women are reacting. That is why I found it very surprising to hear that Senator Payne also did not address herself to the questions that she was actually taking note of. Senator Payne got up and trotted out a list of purport 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed achievements of the Liberal Party but did not deal with the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question was: what is the minister doing with respect to the abhorrent behaviour of one of her colleagues in relation to the status of women? Finally, after interjections, she conceded that she would actually make an opportunity to do something about it. Originally, she was going to say that she might do something, should an opportunity arise. Interjections forced her to the position of saying that she would make sure an opportunity occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question was in relation to the women's bureau. It is one thing for Senator Newman to say, `We are mainstreaming provision of services for women', but we all know that this government is cutting the heart out of government services directed towards achieving improvements for women. They are cutting the heart out of it and they using mainstreaming as an excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at HREOC, another recent example. Some of us are very familiar with what HREOC stands for. It is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. But no, this government is making it the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ideology behind it is obvious for any of us who have worked in this area for many years. It is cutting out equal opportunity in the same way they sought to do with workplace relations. If we go back to workplace relations, this government claims to have brought in equal pay in 1972. We improved those provisions. We made equal remuneration the principle. But this government cut that out of the act, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we consider equal pay in its broad sense and improve the conditions of women? This government did not want us to. They cut equal remuneration&mdash;an internationally recognised principle&mdash;out of the Workplace Relations Act, but still we get Senator Crane and Senator Payne standing up here, compromising themselves, not taking into account what was really done with the Workplace Relations Act. That was not done to give women choice; it was done to remove the choice. It did not acknowledge that often 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7000"> in the work force there is a power differential for women in terms of their negotiating position, and they have not got a hope in hell of exercising any real choice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am getting heartily sick of the continual allegations that this government stands for anything other than equal opportunity and the promotion of women's rights. It constantly amazes me that commentators and critics alike assert that the Howard government would deliberately or intentionally alienate women&mdash;its largest constituency base&mdash;who now make up 50.5 per cent of the Australian population, or further, that the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Newman, would do anything other than strenuously promote and assist women and women's rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this week it was announced that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be restructured to enhance the role of the former sex discrimination commissioner in that we will now have a deputy president who will be solely responsible for both discrimination and equal opportunity. Enhancing the former functions and the role of the sex discrimination commissioner will hardly cut back rights for women!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the commission are really very good news for women because they will enhance the educative function and will mean, in particular, that the changing culture of the workplace will not have to wait until a complaint about discrimination is made, but that there will actually be some possibility to address, in the work force, systemic problems with discrimination against women, and real opportunities to do something about it before discrimination complaints need to arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is hardly cutting back on rights for women; it is actually trying to advance the rights of women. It is trying to identify where the previous regime did not hit the mark effectively, and it is trying to address the problems in a much more effective way. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that Senator Newman has done anything other than vigorously promote the rights of women in her 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> role as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some reason, it seems to be thought by Senator Jacinta Collins, Senator Crowley and others on the other side that mainstreaming will somehow reduce the rights of women. But we all know now that most women do not want to be treated as a special case. They do not want to be pigeon&hyphen;holed and stuck somewhere so that they might get a few crumbs from the budget&mdash;that is, they might get a grant or they might be remembered in the process of what the big boys get. Most women are now grateful that they are part of the main game. That is what we started out to do. We started out to be recognised as equal participants with equal rights, not only in the work force but also with legitimate claims to government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of mainstreaming simply addresses the need for women to be able to actually get a fair slice of the cake. To suggest, in those circumstances, that Senator Newman somehow is not looking after the interests of women because she may or may not be aware of every little program that might have been rationalised around the place, so that women can be treated as grown&hyphen;up and able to access some decent funding for worthwhile programs, is really a silly statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is really serious is that in 1995&hyphen;96 sexual harassment continued to be the largest single ground of complaint under the Sexual Discrimination Act. Forty&hyphen;eight per cent of complaints were of sexual harassment in the workplace. That, of course, mainly relates to women, and that is why I am so proud that we have enhanced the sex discrimination role in the new commission.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attached is the Government's response to recommendations 12-20 the Committee's 341st report entitled "Financial Reporting for the Commonwealth: Towards Greater Transparency".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be writing to you separately in my role as Minister for Finance in respect of recommendations 1-11 of the Report. I will again write to the Committee when the Government has further considered the policy issues associated with the implementation of a full accrual budgeting, accounting and reporting framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee (as outlined in recommendation 12 of report 341) that there is a need for legislation to establish a fiscal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reporting framework binding on Commonwealth governments. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</EMPHASIS>  introduced to the House of Representatives on 11 December 1996 will implement the Government's approach to such a reporting framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with many of the suggestions of the Committee and a number are incorporated in the Charter. These include requirements that governments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> report on fiscal indicators that will demonstrate government financial performance (recommendation 15);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> disclose forward year fiscal estimates (recommendation 15);</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> present budget outcomes at the end of each year (recommendation 16).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a number of specific recommendations are not included in the Charter. To a large extent these are the recommendations that seek to require governments to report on specific fiscal measures within a particular accounting framework. The Government's view is that the legislation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should not be prescriptive about fiscal measures and the accounting framework. This less prescriptive approach enables government reporting to adjust to changing fiscal objectives and incorporate future developments in accounting and reporting. Accordingly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</EMPHASIS>  provides a more flexible framework for government reporting notwithstanding this Government's in principle agreement to the phased implementation of a full accrual budgeting and reporting framework.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion that is before the Senate today deals with a matter that is of particular concern to me&mdash;that is, the treatment of the elderly by this government. I have the privilege of residing on the central coast of New South Wales where many people who are elderly have travelled to retire and enjoy all the benefits and pleasures that a seaside lifestyle at Penrith prices provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election, and with all the things that have occurred, they have been telling me very loud and clear that life is more difficult for them now than it has been for a very, very long time. The elderly in the Australian community are being hurt in very many ways: the provision of health services&mdash;including dental health, hearing services, pharmaceuticals and hospital funding&mdash;the failure of this government, despite their promises, to do anything about private health insurance; the changes to social security; and the restriction of benefits, particularly the requirement that older Australians access their superannuation at age 55 before they can get unemployment benefits, even if they intend to go back into the work force.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7005">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general attitude of the federal government to unemployment impacts also on older Australians as many people between the ages of 50 and 60, who previously enjoyed that decade in making a final contribution in the work force, now find that there is no place for them. They have also cut grants to state governments, which means that a whole range of services&mdash;including the funding of public hospitals and the services which our elderly people used to rely upon in order to have a lifestyle that, I believe, they are entitled to expect&mdash;are no longer available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, for me, the cruellest, the most distasteful and the most vicious of all the things that have happened in relation to elderly people is what has occurred with our nursing homes. Nursing homes are those things that all of us would like to avoid. We all hope that we will go into old age healthy and happy and able to enjoy all the things we would have liked to have enjoyed when we were younger but did not have the time. But the reality is that, for many people, as they get older their health deteriorates, and quite markedly for some people. For this group of people&mdash;the elderly, the very unhealthy and the frail&mdash;nursing homes are not an option; they are an absolute necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not go into nursing homes for a holiday. They do not go there because it would be a bit of fun to visit a nursing home. They go there because they have no other option. The vast majority of people who now reside in nursing homes&mdash;and, I believe, the group of people that will continue to reside in nursing homes&mdash;are frail, elderly women who have chronic illnesses. It is this defenceless group of people which this government has decided to single out for particular punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As from 1 October 1997&mdash;this is why it is important to have this debate today to emphasise the issue&mdash;they will have to pay up&hyphen;front fees for nursing home care if they have, in the opinion of this government, assets from which to pay, and that includes their family home. The only limitation on the amount of fees that are payable is that, after a lifetime of contribution and hard work, residents will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left with the princely sum of only $22,500. It is really quite appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that when this issue was first raised in this chamber we heard extensively from Senator Newman about how we were exaggerating about the size of these up&hyphen;front fees. When we used the figure of $27,000, Senator Newman said that we were using scare tactics&mdash;her favourite term&mdash;that we were scare mongering and that, in fact, the fees would not be anything like that. I suppose in the usual situation of politics, some people might have thought it was true that we were exaggerating. But let me tell you: what we predicted was far below what the fees have turned out to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Senate community affairs inquiry we took extensive evidence from all sorts of people involved in the nursing home industry. In particular, we heard from those who are suppliers of nursing homes, those people who run the business of providing age care. We also heard from the churches in particular that provide nursing homes on a not for profit basis. That second group of people assured us that they would attempt to still cater for those people who could not afford it. But they said that the situation was made extraordinarily difficult because of the paltry amount of money that this government was prepared to offer to subsidise disadvantaged residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have digressed for a moment. I go back to the evidence that was given to us about the size of the fees. We received evidence that, on average, the entry fee for residents who had to pay fees would be $40,000. That is well in excess of anything the minister has ever conceded. That is not where it stops. Some providers of nursing home care went even further. They said that, in fact, some fees in some of the more salubrious nursing homes&mdash;I suppose you are a bit unlucky if you have only those sorts of nursing homes available&mdash;would be well in excess of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is a very sad situation when these elderly and frail are not able to get access to nursing homes unless they have that sort of money available. Also, from 1 November 1997, every nursing home user will pay a daily fee of 25c 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7006"> per dollar earned outside the pension free area&mdash;effectively, a tax of 25 per cent. The end result of this system of up&hyphen;front entry fees and daily fees will be the development of a two&hyphen;tier system of aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the proposition that the Howard government is providing for our aged and our elderly. There are two groups. There are the well off that can go to well&hyphen;appointed nursing homes, maybe of the standard of a five&hyphen;star hotel, or not too far off. They will be well cared for. There is a second level for those who are not so well off, who do not have those sorts of assets, who do not have that sort of money available to them and who do not potentially have affluent members of their family who are prepared or able to bail them out. Those people will go to the second tier of nursing homes&mdash;those starved of resources. It is a very sad situation when those are the options that are being provided for our elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned at some length the other nursing home changes that occurred and how they affect our elderly people. But I suppose I have not really talked about how all these changes affect elderly people, what the pensioners in Woy Woy and in every other area of Australia feel when they see these sorts of changes occurring. You might think you have got away with it. You might think these people have not noticed. To some extent they have not felt the full impact yet because a lot of the changes do not come into effect until this year and some of them not till next year or even later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elderly people in our community feel that they have contributed a great deal during their lifetime. Many of them have gone through the Depression, have gone through world war, have seen economic recession and now see many of their children and their grandchildren unemployed. On top of all that&mdash;the difficulties and problems&mdash;they now see a government that does not care about them and is in fact prepared to punish them in trivial and callous ways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating yet again the issue of aged care, a subject that should be very near and dear to the hearts of the  opposition because, after all, they were in government for 13 years. Yet what never ceases to amaze me is the fact that we never saw them initiate debates on aged care when they were in government&mdash;quite the reverse. The legacy they left this government in aged care is nothing short of breathtaking. It is disgraceful. It is something about which they should be thoroughly and utterly ashamed, yet it is an issue which they conveniently ignore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal has just spoken for approximately 10 minutes and she did not tell the Senate or the people of Australia one single solitary word about what the Labor government did for 13 years to aged people and aged care in particular. Therefore, I think it is about time the Senate was informed of their record. They left a totally and utterly inflexible aged care system incapable of meeting the rapidly increased demands. Even today, thanks to the Labor governments, we still have nearly 40 per cent of residents sharing a room of four beds or more and we are trying to turn that around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did we hear Senator Neal say that after 13 years we had more than 40 per cent of people sharing rooms with four beds or more? No, she did not tell the Senate that. Did she tell the Senate how many old people had lost their dignity and their privacy as a consequence of that particular policy alone? No, she did not. Did she tell the Senate that a small proportion of nursing homes still do not meet the health regulations and requirements? Did she say that at the end of 13 years of Labor government 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet health requirements and that a further 11 per cent did not meet fire requirements? No: zip the lip, absolutely not a syllable about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did Senator Neal tell the Senate that in 1992-93 a total of $45 million was spent on capital stock but by 1993-94 it had declined 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7007"> to $26.5 million, by 1994-95 it was down to $15 million and by 1995-96 it was down to $10.7 million? For Senator Neal's benefit I emphasise this: that just happens to be a 75 per cent reduction in funding. Far from coming in here carping, criticising and scaremongering the way they have been doing for 18 months, they should be coming in here hanging their heads in shame and apologising to the aged people of Australia for slicing off 75 per cent of aged care funding during their 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute and utter disgrace. It is something about which they should be appalled, but no. They come in here exaggerating, scaremongering, simply distorting every element of truth that is possible to be distorted and they have no shame&mdash;no shame whatsoever. That decline in funding represents, as I say, a $35 million decline. That took place over a very short number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference is that the changes we are proposing are designed to bring better consumer protection, better and more sustainable funding, better buildings and better facilities for the care of residents. Yet the Labor Party comes in and complains about it. Having cut $35 million out of it just with the snap of a finger, they come in and complain about a policy that is designed to create those things. Where is their sanity? If they have lost all logic, surely to goodness they have not lost all sanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal is about to walk out because she does not care about their legacy. She does not care about what they have done. She very carefully made sure that she did not tell the Senate about it. Here she has this longwinded mumbo jumbo notice of motion today. We have been forced to debate about their absolute and utter disregard for what they have left this government to deal with. That is just despicable, absolutely and utterly despicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system, I have to say, was in total and utter crisis. Dementia support was all but ignored. How can anyone in this day and age exonerate any government that ignores that factor? Couples were sometimes forced to separate under the former Labor government. That was a regular occurrence, but we are not hearing about that today. Those types of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues are the very issues that we are trying now to reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what did the Labor Party do? They were the ones that created the problem. People who enter hostels were forced to enter a nursing home as soon as their needs changed. The majority of homes and hostels do provide good service. However, the highly intrusive and bureaucratic, yet inefficient, standard monitoring system of Labor all too often failed to identify and redress poor quality care. That is simply a statement of fact. If it were not a statement of fact, we would not have the situation that we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, there were 15 per cent of nursing homes that failed the health regulations and a further 11 per cent that failed the fire regulations. How could they preside over an administration that allows a system to have old people under such threat and yet come in here now and pretend that it did not even happen? It is just appalling. The restricted mobility, inadequate lighting and frightful toilet facilities shared by many people are the system that the Labor Party put in place. There were buildings with multiple storeys and yet no lifts. How could they possibly, in their right mind, allow that to happen? But these things need to be spelled out because this is the environment with which we were confronted on obtaining government in March last year. Yet the Labor Party now has the gall to criticise the very initiatives that are designed to redress these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia absolutely needs reform after 13 years of Labor neglect. We have an ageing population, which they refused also to accept. In 1991 there were less than two million Australians aged over 65. In 30 years time there will be in excess of five million people aged over 65. The Labor government, over 13 years, should have been planning for that. Instead their planning went in the opposite direction. The funding was taken straight out of it. Why? Everyone knows. Blind Freddy knows that the population is getting older. Yet what happened? The funding was taken out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems cannot be fixed overnight, but I can tell you that we are trying fix them as rapidly and as comprehensively as we can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7008"> possibly do. The government has undertaken a substantial reform process which has been distorted by the Labor Party and which has been referred to a committee either chaired by me or of which I have been a member. I cannot get over the amount of distortion and the downright lies that were told during those hearings. There is no other description for some of the things that were claimed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not talking about witnesses because the witnesses, I have to say, in a lot of cases were purely and simply reflecting the misinformation that had been given to them by Labor senators and members in the other chamber&mdash;misinformation that had been put out in newsletters. In fact, Madam Deputy President, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) actually drew your attention to a newsletter that you had put out from your office at that time. I think that it is a very sad reflection, because you are someone who had been involved in this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to have a responsibility not to terrorise old people&mdash;not to terrorise those who are getting to retirement age, but to tell them the truth. Measures contained in the aged care bill will bring substantial capital investment and major improvement to the quality of nursing homes. There is no getting away from that. That has been an accepted fact by most in the aged care industry: that there is a desperate need to make sure that there is a mechanism by which there can be increased funding allocated to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget laid out the clear vision and framework for the future of aged care. It provides flexibility by giving providers the funding to meet the changing needs of aged care consumers. That is all designed around the fact of providing and promoting security, dignity and compassion&mdash;three major elements that were missing in 13 years of Labor government. Newsletter after newsletter after newsletter going out from Labor senators and members are misrepresenting that mere fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is trying to do is to ensure that access to care is still based on needs and not means. Again, only today we hear Senator Neal repeat yet again what she has repeated ad nauseam&mdash;that there are going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be two classes of residents in aged care hostels and nursing homes. She has been put straight on that issue time and time and time again in hearings. She has been told the facts, yet she still comes in here and misrepresents the facts.</PARA>

But I am just waiting to see whether there is anyone on the Labor side this time who is prepared to actually tell the truth of what the aged care package is about to do, because I have not heard it from Senator Neal. She has, in fact, simply come in here today and repeated for the umpteenth time the allegations that she made in the committee hearings&mdash;the very allegations that were refuted time and time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has she said anything about the fact that the government has ensured that places are distributed evenly across Australia? No, she said the reverse. Has she said that the evidence that was given was that most people do not leave nursing homes? No, she said the reverse. Has she said that there is a preference by most people to have share accommodation and not private accommodation? What she is trying to imply is that it is only the wealthy who will get a private room. That is simply not true. The evidence that has been given to the committee has repeated it time and time again. Yet there is not one Labor senator who is prepared to refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, let alone their own memories, and say exactly what was told to them in the committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did Senator Neal come in here and say we will continue to allocate places according to the planning ratio of 100 places for every 1,000 people? No, she did not. She just came in here and said there will be two classes of nursing homes and all the other things that go with it. Did she also say that the assessment teams will continue to permit access according to need&mdash;no-one gets in unless they are approved for residential care by an assessment team? No, she did not. Did she say protection will be there for those who are financially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7009"> disadvantaged or concessional residents and pensioners? She actually said quite the reverse of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can someone keep coming in here misrepresenting so badly the information that they have been given? They could be forgiven if they did it once. But when they repeatedly do it, it is unforgivable. Everyone who has sat through any of the hearings, everyone who has read the bill and everyone who has read any information or literature put out on what has been planned knows full well that there are protections in place in the legislation package for the financially disadvantaged concessional residents and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see if we have it repeated yet again. Let us also see whether we have a statement of the fact that services will be required to set aside at the national average of 27 per cent a number of places for concessional residents. That is not what Senator Neal just said. She said the reverse; she said that those who are concessional residents will not get access. Here we have it said time and time again. But the fact of the matter is that 27 per cent of those places will be set aside for such people. The government is committed to a sustainable aged care system which responds to the needs of the ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find this whole exercise that has been undertaken by the Labor Party today just so awful that words fail to describe it. I will listen with interest to see whether a shred of factual truth is offered by the Labor Party in any of this debate. I as sure as heck have not heard it from Senator Neal yet; in fact, I have heard the reverse. It is about time the Labor Party stopped terrorising the aged community right across Australia. We are trying to turn around a disgraceful 75 per cent reduction in funding that was wrought on this industry by the previous Labor government over 13 years of mismanagement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles talks about changes in the aged care industry. I spent some time over the last couple of months since the last sitting talking to people and visiting some nursing homes. If Senator Knowles got out of this place and talked to the operators of nursing homes, she would be told that her government's legislation has got this most important sector in an absolute mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are nursing homes which have said that they are not prepared to introduce the new bond system that will be available after 1 October, firstly, because they do not believe that it will lead to any opportunities for capital improvement and, secondly, because the prudential requirements&mdash;the principles 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7010"> that are supposed to underpin that legislation&mdash;are still in a state of total disarray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at recent correspondence that was sent from a couple of church leaders to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Anglican Archbishop of Perth, the Most Reverend Dr Carnley, and the Moderator of the Uniting Church in Western Australia, the Reverend John Dunn, have actually called on the Prime Minister to delay the introduction of these changes for at least another 12 months. These changes are due to come into effect from 1 October, only a few days away. And here we have two of the major leaders of churches in this country which have a major involvement, in fact the greatest involvement in terms of provision of aged care facilities, particularly for the lower paid and the disadvantaged, calling upon the Prime Minister to delay the implementation of these changes. They have not bothered to waste their time talking to the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right: why would you? In their letter to John Howard, the Prime Minister, they listed a number of major areas of concern and warned that the minister responsible, Judy Moylan, `is unable to understand the implications of her reform agenda'. The minister does not have a clue, and it is quite clear that Senator Knowles does not have a clue because she parrots this same rhetoric day in and day out about how this is all going to lead to massive improvements in the aged care sector. It is an absolute furphy. I am prepared to bet that in a year's time there will not be any improvement at all; rather there will be a lot of elderly people and their families in this country very concerned about what has happened to the aged care sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent some time over the last couple of months visiting some aged care centres. One that I visited is in the area where I live, Heathcote in New South Wales. Senator Knowles, if you care to, I will take you along one day to visit this centre. There you will find the John Paul II retirement village, a combination of self&hyphen;care, share&hyphen;care, hostel and nursing home accommodation. That is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> magnificent centre which was built and funded during the time of the Labor government, providing top quality care for aged people in that region. You can go to quite a number of others around this country that were funded and built or upgraded during the life of the Labor government, particularly in the very early years of the Labor government when we inherited a run&hyphen;down, rotten sector left to us by the legacy of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard years between 1975 and 1983. A significant amount of capital money from government was poured into that sector in those early years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles talks about not coming clean on the facts, but Senator Knowles never refers to that. She talks about what may have happened in the last couple of years. I remind Senator Knowles what happened in the last budget. There was no money at all in the last budget for government contribution towards capital funding and upgrading of nursing home facilities. What this government has instituted is a system whereby people who in the past were always able to access nursing home beds at no up&hyphen;front costs to themselves will now, in many cases, be forced to sell their homes to raise the bond money to get a bed in a nursing home. You can understand the stress and trauma that causes those elderly people and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had some recent experience in talking to people who have come to me where their families are in that situation. It is heartbreaking to talk to those people because they are in a situation where suddenly, from 1 October this year, they may have to find $80,000 or $100,000 for themselves or maybe for their parents so that their loved one can find accommodation in a nursing home. I could spend all the time allotted to me on this nursing home issue, but I should move on to some others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion on this issue, I want to remind Senator Knowles that, quite clearly, the people involved in the provision of aged care know that your proposal will not work. Unfortunately, people are going to suffer before that is proven to this government. The government will not listen now but they will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7011"> have to listen in 12 months or so, and they will certainly listen at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other things has this government done? Looking through the record, I was trying to find something positive that the government has done for older Australians but I could not find one. I could find a long list of things that this government has implemented, either through the budgetary process or through legislation in the parliament, which will have a very deleterious effect on older people. For a start, let us look at health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government trumpeted that it was going to fix the declining membership in private health insurance. Many older people have private health insurance because they believe that in their later years they are more susceptible to illness or accident and feel the need for greater security. More importantly, many older Australians are in health funds because they have been in those health funds for many years. They have stayed with the funds notwithstanding the huge increases in premiums that have occurred in the last 18 months whilst this government has been in office, increases in the order of 20 to 30 per cent. All the funds have been applying to put up their premiums and have been allowed to do so by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to elderly people having to find an extra $200, $300 or $400 per year for their health insurance coverage&mdash;and they are not in a position to opt out&mdash;this government has tried the old `fistful of dollars' trick. Remember Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's famous fistful of dollars? That is what this government has done with respect to private health insurance. It has implemented a scheme whereby it says, `If you take out private health insurance, or if you already have it, we will give you $225 or, in the case of a family, $450 a year as a rebate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That did not come into operation until July 1997, the beginning of this financial year, so many people will not receive the rebate for 12 months, until the end of this financial year. The government, at the same time that they have offered that, have allowed the private health funds to savagely increase their premiums. I provided evidence during the Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estimates hearings of elderly people who had written to me and to other members of the opposition&mdash;apparently, they had written to government members as well but they took no notice, of course&mdash;telling us how this supposed rebate system was not going to cover anywhere near the cost of increases in their health insurance premiums. So you have conned elderly people on that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else has this government done? The list goes on. Look what they have done with respect to pharmaceuticals. In the last budget, they de&hyphen;listed a number of drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits schedule&mdash;drugs which, if provided on prescription, were available at cheaper prices to all people, including elderly people. Many elderly people, as we know, have a greater need to visit doctors and they place great store in the advice of the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has removed from the pharmaceutical benefits schedule prescriptions which include those for the treatment of common gastrointestinal problems and anti&hyphen; inflammatory liniment for pain relief of sprains and muscle strains&mdash;something which many elderly people suffer from, as Senator Eggleston would know. They require pain relief for arthritis and similar conditions. This government has taken a number of those drugs off the list. They will be more expensive for elderly people to buy. The budget papers state that these changes will apply to eligible veterans and their dependants in respect of the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So they do not even get an exemption from some of the increases that will apply because of de&hyphen;listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of what is known as the therapeutic group premiums changes, elderly people will be forced to pay higher prices for drugs which may be prescribed by their doctors for the treatment of depression, ulcers, high blood pressure or high cholesterol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to seriously ask: what sort of government takes these measures, particularly when they will impact severely upon the most vulnerable groups in our community&mdash;the sick and the elderly? In the estimates committee hearings, we heard evidence that some of these drugs will be grouped, and only the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7012"> cheapest drug will be available under the PBS. If a doctor prescribes a drug which is similar in nature but not quite the same, because he believes the patient needs that particular brand of drug and not the one that is listed on the PBS, in some cases they will pay up to $20, $30 or $40 for these drugs, rather than the subsidised price. Again, the elderly are being hit with potentially massive increases in their health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about palliative care funding? If anything is important for the aged community, it is the provision of adequate palliative care. Fortunately, over recent years, society has recognised more and more the importance of palliative care for people in their later years. What did this government do? It reduced funding to the palliative care program by 10 per cent. Under the Labor government, during those 13 years that Senator Knowles talked about, funding for palliative care increased because, as Senator Knowles recognised, we have an ageing population. Also, as I said, there was a greater recognition that that area of health care required additional funds. But Senator Knowles did not talk about how funding increased during the 13 years of the Labor government. And she sure as heck did not mention how it went down in the first 18 months of this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, there is so much to say that I should get an extension of time. We should be debating this matter for the rest of the day. What about the dental health program&mdash;a great initiative of the Labor government which provided free dental care for the elderly, for pensioners? What did this government do? It abolished it. It said, `Out; that's it, gone.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the closure of Medicare offices? Forty&hyphen;three Medicare offices throughout Australia are to be closed down. Can you imagine the impact that that will have on elderly people? In the past they were able to go to the local Medicare office in their suburb. It gave them the opportunity to lodge their claims. They walked up the street one day and found that the office was gone. They might now have to get on a train or a bus and travel five or 10 kilometres to the nearest office. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to get worse, because this government has today introduced legislation into the other place which intends to corporatise&mdash;probably privatise, in the future&mdash;Medibank Private. In future, under that legislation, Medicare offices will no longer provide Medibank Private services. So, an elderly person who now is able to go to their local Medicare office, lodge their Medicare claim and lodge a claim with Medibank Private in future will not be able to do that. In future the 270&hyphen;odd Medicare offices throughout Australia that currently also provide Medibank Private facilities will all cease to provide those facilities and there will be only 70 Medibank Private offices throughout the country. I will say more on that when the legislation comes into the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles talks about 13 years of Labor government. She should go and visit some of the magnificent new facilities for aged care that were built in our era in government. She should go to John Paul II retirement village in Heathcote and have a look for herself. Then she should have a look at what this government has done in 18 months. The only good thing that is happening is that some of the people within the cabinet that have been responsible for these decisions are getting out. I fear, however, that the replacements are not going to be any better.</PARA></SPEECH>

Before I do so, I would like to say that so far the opposition speakers on this motion have engaged in a litany of misrepresentation and falsehood. Let us take what Senator Forshaw has just said about the closure of Medicare offices. He well knows that the government is introducing a system whereby people can lodge Medicare claims in pharmacies, and that is being trialled in this country at the moment. Instead of having to hop on a bus or a train and travel five or 10 miles to the nearest Medicare office, they will be able to go to the pharmacy and fill in a form; there will be a fax machine there which will fax it straight into Medicare. That will be a lot easier, a lot simpler and a lot less costly to the government. That is something that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7013"> Senator Forshaw knows is in train. What he asserted is an example of the kind of misrepresentation that is going on in this chamber today on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal claimed, in true Labor scare tactic fashion, that there will be a massive transfer of funding responsibility from the general community to older people as a result of the government's aged care reform package. That, of course, is absolute nonsense. Nothing could be further from the truth. The government is providing a system under which the conditions and services provided to the aged will improve. When one considers that we are dealing with an opposition who, when they were in government, massively cut funding to aged care, one can only wonder at the depth of their hypocrisy on this matter. I repeat that point: the reality is that, while in government, the ALP massively cut funding to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Knowles has said&mdash;I repeat it for emphasis&mdash;in 1992&hyphen;93, when Labor were in government, some $45 million was available to nursing homes for capital improvement purposes. By 1995-96, this had been reduced to $10.7 million&mdash;a 75 per cent reduction. That is pretty massive in anybody's terms. Furthermore, only $2.7 million of this money was available for upgrading old and substandard services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appalling state of Australia's nursing homes which was left by Labor for older Australians is why the government has introduced the aged care reform package that it has. The reforms the government has introduced are critical, because aged care facilities in this country were left to decay as a result of the policies of the previous government. What we are talking about are dingy facilities with beds packed together in overcrowded rooms, shared toilets, and so on. Anybody who has been to many of the nursing homes in Australia can only be depressed by what they saw and appalled to think that our older citizens, at the end of their lives, are left to live in these forms of accommodation. Surely, the government argued, our older citizens deserved a lot better than the kinds of facilities that they had to go to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to address the needs of Australia's ageing population. It has to be remembered that the number of aged persons is going up rapidly, and we are increasingly going to have to consider the needs of the aged. In 1991 there were fewer than two million Australians aged over 65. In 30 years time, there will be five million, and they will represent a much more significant percentage of our population than the aged do today. The greying of Australia is a real phenomenon which future governments will have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of what the opposition has said today, the measures the government is putting in place with respect to nursing homes will ensure that access to residential aged care is based on need and not means. I repeat: it will be based on need and not means and will provide equity for the Australian population. No-one will be denied care or access to a nursing home on the basis of their bank balance, and no-one will be forced to sell their home to gain entry to an aged care facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is committed to providing both equity and social justice for all older Australians by introducing changes to funding arrangements for nursing homes. In fact, what the government is doing is following the pattern which the opposition, when in government, introduced for hostels. The government understands that few residents of aged care facilities can afford to pay for the whole cost of their care and also recognises that some contribution to the cost of care is a fair and reasonable expectation. The initiatives of the aged care reform package aim to ensure that facilities for aged care are at an acceptable standard to the community and also meet the needs of Australia's ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great hypocrisies about the opposition's position today is that the reforms the coalition government has made to aged care&mdash;namely, the introduction of accommodation bonds&mdash;are similar, and copied from, a program which Labor introduced in 1988 to provide for accommodation bonds for entry to hostels. The purpose of that was to improve the standards of the hostels and improve the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7014"> conditions under which hostel residents live. That program has been extremely successful. I find it totally hypocritical of the opposition to suggest today that a similar program introduced to nursing homes will not be equally successful in improving the standards of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said by Senator Forshaw today that people will have to pay $80,000 to $100,000 to get into a nursing home. Of course that is not actually true. First of all, people do not have to pay any bonds at all for six months. They can pay a weekly accommodation fee. It is also true that something like 40 per cent of nursing home residents are not in residence after six months. It is only after six months that the question of paying a full accommodation bond arises. The reason 40 per cent of people or thereabouts are not in residence after six months is, rather sadly, that they have usually died. So the question of somebody who is terminally ill or in a critical state having to sell the family home to cover the cost of a high accommodation bond simply does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal spoke at length about the possibility of a two-tiered system developing within our nursing home system in Australia. Again, as Senator Knowles has pointed out, that simply is not the case. By law, 27 per cent of the residents in all of these facilities will be concessional residents; that is, they will be people who are on social security. Thus, there will always be a mix in all of these nursing homes so that a two-tiered system simply does not develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go on to the question of pharmaceutical benefits. The claim that older Australians will face an unfair burden on the cost of pharmaceutical benefits is really quite unfounded&mdash;another example of the misrepresentation which has been going on here today. Senator Forshaw referred to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was developed to provide affordable access for all members of the Australian community to necessary and cost-effective medicines. He talked about medications being taken off the pharmaceutical benefits list. He sought to imply, therefore, that older people would be disadvantaged and somehow left to suffer because things like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> liniment were being taken off the pharmaceutical benefits list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is absolute rubbish. Certainly medicines are being taken off the pharmaceutical benefits list all the time because the Department of Health and Family Services is constantly reviewing the list to ensure that the costs of providing medications do not get out of hand. Nevertheless, there is always medication available within that list of pharmaceutical benefits to cover all or most medical situations, particularly in the case of people suffering with arthritis. I assure him that there is an almost endless number of medications&mdash;non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&mdash;available on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I have no doubt that a wide variety of choice in that kind of medication will remain there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the government carries over 80 per cent of the outlays on pharmaceutical benefits scheme medications. That amounts&mdash;I would like to record for the benefit of the opposition today&mdash;to some $2,500 million annually. That is the cost for 1996-97. There is both a concessional system and a safety net system in place which, from my understanding, means that the cost of pharmaceutical medicine is fairly and equitably shared by the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Persons who, for various reasons, qualify for concessions pay only $3.20 per pharmaceutical benefit prescription, which is not a great deal of money. It means that they have access to the full range of medications at a vastly reduced cost. The safety net system is designed for both concessional and non-concessional patients, for old and young Australians. For instance, once the eligible expenditure of a person on medication exceeds $612.60 within a calendar year, the co&hyphen;payment or the actual cost to the patient decreases from $20 an item to just $3.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see how this system is increasing the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to older Australians, whether concessional or non&hyphen;concessional. The safety net system can be said to provide equity of access to pharmaceutical benefits for all Australians, including older Australians. This is something which the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7015"> opposition has sought to misrepresent here this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal also claimed that older Australians face a disproportionate share of funding cuts to home and community care&mdash;or HACC, as it is known. The HACC program's objective is to support frail older people and to enable them to remain in their homes by the provision of a comprehensive range of high quality and cost&hyphen;effective services. The government recognises the value of that and understands that it is much more cost&hyphen;effective to keep people in their homes than to have them in hospitals and being cared for in institutions. It is not only cost&hyphen;effective but also better for them psychologically because they are in their own home surroundings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the government announced its commitment to maintain growth in the HACC program while at the same time recognising that the capacity to improve equity user charges across services should be recognised. In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the government announced further growth in the HACC program of some $25 million. I believe that this demonstrates that the government is committed to the continuance of the HACC program and sees the value of it. There is no question but that the government will maintain the home and community care program because it understands its value and importance to the aged and elderly people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I believe that the changes the coalition government has made to aged care are both fair and equitable and that the government has demonstrated that it has an ongoing commitment to providing quality services to the aged people in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pass much comment on the contribution made by other people here today, other than to note that, really, in terms of unctuous nonsense, it is certainly up there. I have to say, as somebody who was senior adviser to a state minister for health and aged care under a federal Labor government, that the record of Labor in the 13 years it was in government is a proud one indeed, particularly the contribution made by the then minister, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Peter Staples, to the reform of aged care and the setting of standards with regard to aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to see a situation&mdash;I think we are well on the way to it&mdash;like the one faced by people in New Zealand. Six or seven years ago I was in New Zealand during an election campaign. An elderly lady there unfortunately went into a coma, which meant that she was unable to keep up her health payments to the hospital where she was situated. The health board of that region was legally able to come in and sell her house in order to meet the costs of her hospitalisation. Unfortunately or fortunately she never came out of that coma. If she had she would have found that she had nowhere to live. That is precisely the difficulty with the economic rationalist type approach that this government is taking not only to aged care but to almost every other major policy issue that this country faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am not here to talk about that in any detail&mdash;I will leave that to other colleagues. I am here to talk about subparagraph (ii), which relates to growing levels of economic insecurity for older Australians, including a decline in job opportunities and forced early retirement. I think it is very important for the other side of the chamber to understand why they are sitting over there on the other side of the chamber. One of the reasons they are over there is that aged or older Australians&mdash;not all of them, but the majority of older Australians&mdash;would have voted for the coalition. I think the coalition is aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those older Australians would be saying to themselves, `Why did we do that? What on earth did we do? We believed their commitments. We believed the promises that they made. What has happened now? We've been hoodwinked. We've been sold a pup.' They were lulled into a false sense of security by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he said, `We govern for all Australians.' They thought, `Well, that must mean me.' It did not, it does not and it will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has failed to protect the interests of mature age Australians. The coalition's policies, this government's policies, have undermined the interests of mature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7016"> age Australians. You need look no further for actual empirical evidence of this than to carefully examine the cuts to aged care which were amply covered by my colleagues earlier; the cuts to public housing; the cuts to pharmaceutical benefits; and the cuts to employment opportunities. These cuts are increasingly and unfortunately creating an environment whereby forced early retirement is becoming more prevalent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an ageing population&mdash;this was canvassed earlier. For example, there are 2.2 million Australians over the age of 65, and the number is rapidly increasing. Many of them, as I said, voted for the coalition at the last election, and many of them regret that. Why do they regret that? Let us look at unemployment, but first of all I will remind the chamber of the current unemployment level&mdash;it is 8.7 per cent. This government said it would get unemployment down. To restate something which I have said before, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has said that, if the government does not get unemployment below eight per cent, it does not deserve to get reelected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it became increasingly obvious that it was consistently impossible for the government to meet this target, Senator Vanstone changed her tune. She said&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So Vanstone had to retract that and say, `Well, they will give us a big tick for effort.' Here again we have Senator Vanstone saying, `Don't hold your breath in terms of rapid economic growth.'  Initially, the Prime Minister said, `In order to make a dint in unemployment, you have to get economic growth over four per cent.' Then Senator Vanstone said, `Even if we do'&mdash;it's not going to happen under this government&mdash;`get a rapid growth in the economy, don't expect a rapid decrease in unemployment levels.' So I do not know who you believe in this government. Clearly, the messages are mixed. In the case of Senator Vanstone, often the metaphors are mixed as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with regard to unemployment for older Australians is this. In June 1997, 91,700 people aged 50 and over were looking for work. That is a very disturbing statistic indeed. Of these people, 44,000 have been looking for work for a year or longer. Whilst 12 per cent of unemployed people are 50 and over, this group accounts for 19 per cent of all people who are out of work for more than a year. Men aged 50 and over make up 20 per cent of the ranks of long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is axiomatic that older people stay unemployed for very long periods and they are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the long&hyphen;term unemployed. Clearly, this is a very dismal situation and something that needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the breakdown of age versus unemployment, the ABS found in a recent labour force survey that age was identified by 44 per cent of respondents aged 45 as the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7017"> biggest single problem in securing employment. This is not good news for anybody, especially those of us&mdash;although we all are&mdash;getting older in relation to finding employment. At age 55, age was identified as the biggest single problem by 65 per cent of respondents. So what we are talking about here is something that is widespread and increases exponentially the older you get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to participation rate compared with 30 years ago and now: 30 years ago, the participation rate in the labour force for 45s and over was 80. People aged 45&hyphen;plus account for a proportion of people too discouraged these days to seek new work, and they are simply dropping out of the work force. The participation rate of older Australians is declining, as it is, incidentally, for women, as they give up and drop out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From where are these jobs going? They are amongst blue-collar workers. You do not have to look any further than what happened in Newcastle and the types of shock waves that that sent around Australia. It said to everyone that nobody is safe; no worker is safe. It confirmed what people in this chamber who go out and talk to people in the community have found: the feeling of insecurity and vulnerability out there is palpable. People are scared. They are very worried; they are scared about their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have lost jobs from industries that have gone through significant restructuring, such as manufacturing, construction and the trades and labouring occupations. An interesting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> editorial of Tuesday this week pointed out that `Canberra throws too much money at companies to adjust to free trade', which is something, I presume, people on the other side would agree with. The editorial then went on to say that workers, in fact, deserve more. I will quote the first paragraph of the editorial, and then I will move on to the TCF stuff:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, the Industry Commission notes that the Howard Government has cut economy&hyphen;wide labour market programs from $2.73 billion in 1995&hyphen;06 to $1.89 billion this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the editor's comment, not mine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(maybe they had too much of Mr Keating in them). And the TCF Labour Adjustment Package&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">originally due to run until 2000 to help displaced workers get jobs outside the industry&mdash;was abolished in the 1996 budget. Sure, such labour market programs have a mixed record (but no more so than handouts to capital). And the Howard Government cutbacks are part of an innovative experiment in shifting the delivery of training programs to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst I obviously do not agree with all of it, basically this editorial is saying that there has to be some assistance to workers in these industries to provide predispositions for displacement and adjustment where industries are going through a major restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to TCF again, the minority report prepared by Mr Philip Brass suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unreasonable to permit the toll of tariff reform to fall so heavily on TCF employees, many of whom are drawn from vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is from these groups that mature aged employees are represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not think white&hyphen;collar workers are safe from what is happening at the moment either. In terms of the white-collar sector, there is definitely attrition with regard to older workers. We have evidence that the tax office, for example, is having forced redundancies&mdash;something this government said it would not do. There have been 25 to date and there will be more to follow. Clearly, the ATO is being used as a groundbreaker with regard to forced redundancies and in terms of the so&hyphen;called reforms of the APS this government is embarking on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So neither sector is being helped by this government. There is no clear industry policy and, for those of us who have been involved in the industry inquiry conducted by the Senate Economics Committee&mdash;and that includes you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson&mdash;that is a message that is coming through loud and clear. There is no discernible industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have had is flip&hyphen;flopping, depending on the electoral imperatives or depending on how much pressure is put on the Prime Minister with regard to that. I understand that is causing some concern on the other side of the chamber, but there is no industry policy. Business is, therefore, not investing because it does not know what the preconditions are

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this government doing? Not much, you would be surprised to know, other than adding to the economic insecurity and job insecurity which already exists in older Australians. I refer again to Senator Vanstone's comments at the CEDA meeting, where she said, `We need a freer labour market and lessened job security to reduce unemployment.' The quote was, `You have to have, it might be described as, lessened job security.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full marks to Senator Vanstone for telling the truth about what this government actually believes. She actually told the truth about what this government believes. Normally, we have these comments from the likes of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), who talks about flexibility. He says, `What we need is more flexibility.' That is code for reduced employment security and lessened job security. Senator Vanstone had the intestinal fortitude to actually come out and say it. She blew the whistle on what the agenda of this government is with regard to workers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone also said&mdash;and, again, full marks to her for saying this&mdash;that the government's spending cuts were partly to blame for high unemployment. Absolutely; 10 out of 10 to Senator Vanstone for telling the truth here. I do not think many of her colleagues on the other side appreciated it, but I am pleased to say that her comments have been echoed and agreed with around Australia, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where the head of the TDR cited very clearly how expenditure cuts in a regional microcosm like Tasmania had affected unemployment&mdash;a state which, everybody in this chamber would be aware, has the highest unemployment rate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else has this government done? It has slashed labour market programs and not put anything in their place. There is no regional development policy. I note with some interest though that the papers a couple of weekends ago reported that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, would be forced to have a look at regional development policies because the economies in those regions were in such a parlous state that something had to be done. Hooray! How long has it taken Mr Howard to wake up to that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation, a Labor initiative, was slashed. Why? As far as people in my state are concerned, they do not know why. Working Nation was a very worthwhile initiative. It was slashed because the government has a different ideological perspective with regard to employment generation. In my state and in other areas of high unemployment, the cuts to that program had a devastating effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96 there were 17 private or community sector case managers contracted by the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as mature age specialists. What has this government done? The government, under the new employment services provisions, has thrown the mature age unemployed to the market to determine their employability. It is a market which has already got a culture of not employing people who are 45 or over&mdash;that culture is unfortunately there&mdash;and a market that has declining job opportunities for the mature age unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996 under Labor, we had 17 mature worker centres which helped the mature age unemployed improve their skills via education or training. These centres also provided counselling, development of activities to meet participants' training needs, job referrals and advocacy to prospective employers. There was also an emphasis&mdash;interestingly, because we are dealing with older workers here&mdash;on information technology training. Where are those mature age centres? What has happened 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7019"> now? They are gone. Abolished. Why? Because of cuts to skillshare. They are gone. That is what this government thinks of mature age workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the government's work for the dole scheme. That is not going to help young people&mdash;never mind people who are in the mature age category. I think it is farcical to believe otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We move on to what else the government has done and we move on to industrial relations, one of my favourite topics. Just harking back to Senator Vanstone's comment with regard to industrial relations, she talked about a freer labour market and lessened job security. The industrial relations provisions brought in by this government should satisfy Senator Vanstone, because that is precisely what they are intended to deliver. The industrial relations provisions provide for individual contracts, AWAs, between the employer and the employee where the employing power is definitely on the side of the employer. At estimates, we had some success getting some more information on these AWAs. I am grateful for that. It has taken a long time, and let us see how much we get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the passage of the workplace relations bill, we used the example of young people who have to go out and negotiate with their employers about their wages and conditions and we showed how disempowered they would be. Older workers are in exactly the same category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, we have a culture whereby people who are 45 and over are finding it difficult to get jobs. If younger people are disempowered as a result of the provisions in the Workplace Relations Act, how do you think older people are faring? I do not think they are even getting in the door, never mind getting to the stage of actually negotiating an AWA with a prospective employer. So this so-called freer labour market&mdash;again, as Senator Vanstone has stated quite clearly as one of her objectives&mdash;is providing a less secure working environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the government sector, we also have outsourcing, downsizing and massive cuts&mdash;and many of the public sector workers are in fact older workers. We have the chan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ges to superannuation, which I am sure my colleague Senator Sherry will cover in his contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line under this government is that, if you are 45 or over and out of a job, you will not get any help. The government's policies highlight the government's incapacity, unwillingness and simple lack of care to play an active part in battling unemployment. The government prefers to deal with economic figures rather than human beings. This government prefers to talk about getting the economic fundamentals right and says that everything else will follow. Industry knows that is not right. Mature age workers know that is not right. Certainly, the people on this side of the chamber know that that is not right.</PARA></SPEECH>

Perhaps we should look forward to Senator Sherry talking about child care when he gets up to talk to this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to turn my thoughts and comments this afternoon back to the substantive issue: older Australians. I actually agree with Senator Neal and Senator Forshaw that the interests of older Australians is an issue of utmost importance. It is an issue of importance because older Australians deserve dignity, respect and policies designed to protect and support their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also an issue because of our demographics. We all know that Australia's population is ageing. In the next 50 years, the number of people over 80 will rise from one in five to one in three of the population. By 2020, one in every four Australians will be over 65. But it is at this point that my views and those of the Labor senators must diverge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is well aware of the issues intrinsic in this situation but, unlike the last Labor government, we tackle the issues head on. The late Labor government's record in the area of aged care is a disgrace. When we took 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7020"> office, we discovered that the Labor government had neglected aged care to an extent that we could hardly comprehend&mdash;11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards, 15 per cent of nursing homes did not meet state health standards and 40 per cent of nursing home patients were in a room with four or more beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government neglected our older people in terms of safety, health and dignity. Many of those buildings have serious structural deficiencies and, as a result of the ALP's inactivity, residents and staff are placed in an unsafe environment. Some buildings constitute a serious fire danger&mdash;they may not have fire walls, fire exits are blocked and windows do not open. Too many people share a room, as Senator Knowles told us earlier today. Having eight beds in a room severely cramps movement and mobility and grants residents no privacy, no room for personal belongings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the Labor Party care about social justice and equity, or are those issues only mentioned at election time, Senator Conroy? The ALP were warned. Professor Bob Gregory reported to them in 1985 that $125 million was needed to bring nursing home infrastructure up to an acceptable level. Their response to this was an allocation of $10 million a year on a tiered system standard aggregated module&mdash;sounds impressive, does it not! But all it really equalled was $3 a day per resident for capital upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's record is appalling. The coalition is determined to right this wrong, and the focus given to this area by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is a testament to the coalition's commitment to help and support older Australians. We are not ignoring the elderly. We are consulting, listening and addressing their concerns. We are protecting our people in all those areas where Labor failed them. We are putting in place standards, something Labor never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the physical standards of a nursing home or hostel are inadequate, they will not be able to charge accommodation bonds. The Howard government is going to protect the security of those bonds. We committed ourselves to protect residents' funds, and we have. Under the Labor government, there was no such 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection. Our program supports those already in nursing homes. They will not have to pay bonds. So we are protecting the financially disadvantaged, the people Labor neglected, even though they claim it is their major constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those in the community who cannot afford an accommodation bond, the government has mandated that a national average of 27 per cent of beds that nursing homes must allocate to the financially disadvantaged. Our reforms have been applauded by groups involved in caring for older people. Jim Toohey from the Assisted Living Association&mdash;Queensland's peak aged care organisation&mdash;welcomed the $12 a day subsidy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an incentive for providers to allocate more places for financially disadvantaged residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Catholic Health Care Association also welcomed the additional subsidy. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With such a massive reform strategy soon to be under way, it is now more comforting knowing that the access for financially disadvantaged people to residential aged care services will be improved with these increased subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Far from being a problem, as the ALP is trying to make out, this reform helps the disadvantaged and, in addition, has been welcomed by those involved in the area of aged care. After all, our reforms have the overt support of Aged Care Australia, Anglicare, the Assisted Living Association, the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, Community Services Australia, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association&mdash;the list goes on. In fact, these reforms have been so well received that one peak organisation described our Minister for Family Services, Minister Moylan, `as the best federal minister for aged care in 20 years'.</PARA>

It is shameful for you to be attacking and undermining this most important group of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, what did you ever do for these people? You say that our policies have resulted in economic insecurity for older Australians and a decline in job opportunities. Look at your record. You were the ones who pushed their unemployment rates through the roof. Senator Neal and Senator Mackay had the audacity to raise the issue of unemployment amongst older Australians. Let me remind the Senate that, in December 1985, 5.3 per cent of males aged 55 to 59 were out of work. Within nine years, it had leapt to 10.9 per cent&mdash;more than double.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay gave us a wide ranging speech of some 18 minutes duration on unemployment. I will not. I believe those numbers speak for themselves. They stand alone. Unemployment amongst mature aged people under the Labor government doubled. You have not said sorry for losing 400,000 jobs during the recession we had to have. How do you think policies that put people out of work affected their ability to save and plan for getting older? How do you think that affected their economic security? You claim we are not looking after older Australians sufficiently and giving them enough security, but you did not provide for any group of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Labor government, living standards declined precipitously. Australia's ranking on a world per capita basis dropped&mdash;plummeted, I might say&mdash;from 10th to 22nd position in the 10 years from 1983 to 1993. Indeed, research commissioned from the Economic Planning Advisory Commission found that between 1983 and 1994 real earnings of the lowest 10 per cent of earners fell. The gap between the rich and the poor under Labor increased markedly.</PARA>

Let me point out to the honourable senator who said `rubbish' that in the worst year of 1990 they suffered a nine to 10 per cent decline in real earnings compared to 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on living standards, let us for a minute reflect on the purchasing power of people's savings under Labor and now under the coalition. Of course, we all know how important inflation is to the whole equation. People who were no longer income earners had their savings eroded by extreme levels of high inflation under Labor. Your record on inflation is a disgrace. Inflation in the December 1985 quarter was 8.2 per cent. A year later, it was 9.8 per cent. In 1990, it was still up at 8.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What effect do you think these policies produced for older Australians, or do you just not care? Under the coalition, inflation is now at its lowest level for years&mdash;reminiscent of the good old days of the 1960s. In fact, it is an inflation rate of 0.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition does not just talk about caring for older Australians; it demonstrates its caring in tangible outcomes. It does so with progressive policies designed to protect their needs and interests by creating an economy that preserves their lifetime earnings and makes their every day living expenses cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our changes to aged care are taking effect and will continue to do so for years. After four years, this government expects to see its changes bring in $130 million a year to the nursing home sector for use in capital upgrade. That is $5 million more than the amount that members on the other side of the chamber were told was needed in 1985 when they refused to do anything. The coalition is helping. It is making a difference; it is caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not care, though. You misrepresent at every opportunity. You, along with the media, frequently portray older women in Australia as being frail and inactive, which is simply not the case. Pru Goward, the head of the Office of the Status of Women, is very concerned about this. She said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7022">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The media preys on older women, feeding them fears about their physical frailty and their subsequent vulnerability to danger.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Often today these women are still active and healthy, not frail and doddering. Their life expectancy has increased by eight years since 1960, but you still want to portray them as victims and still do nothing to help them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government will develop an aged women's policy in the next 12 months, something Labor never did. As part of that, we are going to look at the very issues that affect many women and contribute to any disadvantage they may experience, including issues like social security and superannuation. The Howard government is also fighting these damaging and negative stereotypes in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Conference for Older Australians was established by the Prime Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan. This conference has many roles: to coordinate the government involvement in the International Year of Older Persons in 1999; to devise strategies to promote an image, a positive image, of older people; and to help advise the government on strategies for dealing with an ageing population. It is an initiative that must have escaped your memory because you have failed to mention it today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of this conference, which consists of a distinguished group of Australians, including Ita Buttrose and Major General Digger James, displays yet again this government's commitment not only to the consultative process but also to our senior citizens, the people the ALP accuses us of neglecting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor was in government for 13 years yet did nothing to help these groups of older Australians. At the last election the Labor Party could produce only 200 words to demonstrate any interest at all in older Australians. That was the sum total of their election commitment&mdash;less than one page. All the ALP seemed capable of giving to older Australians was higher unemployment, increased living costs and greater debt. On the other hand, we are currently legislating to maintain the single rate of pension at no less 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. We are acting to help older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government will never say, as Captain Wacky did, `This is as good as it gets.' This is the only government for all Australians. This is the government that cares about older Australians and values immensely their contributions to our society. This is the government that will not shirk the tough decisions the way that Labor did. The Howard government is a  compassionate but strong government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points I would like to respond to in respect of Senator Synon's contribution. I note in her concluding remarks she said that Labor, in 13 years, did nothing for elderly Australians. I will be illustrating in the course of my remarks that Labor did a great deal. The purpose of the debate today is to focus on the failure of this government to protect the interests of older Australians. I think one of the central points I will make in my speech is what Labor did and what this government has done in respect of the incomes of older Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of debate over the last 10 or 15 years about our ageing population. In 1986, shortly after Labor came to power, there were 1.7 million persons in Australia over the age of 65. The last available statistics for 1996 were that there were 2.2 million persons over the age of 65. By the year 2006 it is forecast to reach 2.6 million. By the year 2026, when I suspect most of us will be long gone, there will be 4.6 million people over the age of 65. By the year 2051 there will be six million people over the age of 65. As a percentage of the population, which I think is the more relevant statistic, in 1986 just over 10 per cent of the population were over the age of 65 and by the year 2051 23 per cent, just over one in four, of the population will be over the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Synon made the comment that Labor did nothing for older Australians in its 13 years in government. I recall one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7023"> first things Labor did when it came to power was increase the age pension to 25 per cent of male average ordinary time earnings&mdash;25 per cent minimum guaranteed. Labor has maintained that principle and that level of income support for pensioners in this country for retired persons ever since that time. On occasions it exceeded 25 per cent of male average weekly ordinary time earnings. That was very important to persons who were retired in Australia because it meant that there was an automatic movement of their income. We avoided the situation that occurred at budget time normally when sometimes there was an increase a few dollars here or there in the aged pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did this government do when it came to power? One of the first things it did was commission the National Commission of Audit, which recommended a change to that formula for increasing the aged pension. The National Commission of Audit proposed to change the formula which would have meant that future increases would have been smaller than under the Labor formula. The government has not adopted that recommendation from the National Commission of Audit, not as yet anyway. It will be interesting to see what they do in that regard. But it is totally false for Senator Synon to claim that Labor did nothing. I am going to seek to avoid extravagant argument this afternoon, but in Senator Synon's extravagant argument she did not recognise what I think was one of the most important reforms for the elderly in our community in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a wide range of other reforms that Labor carried out in power. I do not want to traverse them all. Medicare was another change. It is an enormous benefit to all Australians but particularly to elderly Australians. It took away a lot of the fear and uncertainty of retirement years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor did not just assist Australians who had already retired; it recognised the ageing population and the particular problems this was going to lead to. I referred earlier to the increasing number as a total and as a proportion of the population of aged persons in Australia. Labor recognised that superannuation up to 1983 was fundamentally unfair in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its application. Up until that date I think less than 40 per cent of Australian workers had superannuation. It tended to be confined to higher income persons in this country. It generally benefited male workers and the proportion of women who had it was very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor took some important steps during its 13 years in power to extend superannuation coverage to all Australians. The superannuation guarantee commenced at three per cent, phasing up to nine per cent by the year 2002, and Labor had a commitment to a co&hyphen;contribution of three per cent from the government direct and three per cent from employees. The new Liberal government made an identical promise to ensure that the three and three per cent co&hyphen;contribution were delivered. They broke that promise in the last budget and they repackaged it, largely in the form of a savings rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wanted to highlight a few of the issues in respect of Labor's time in government, but I want to concentrate my remarks this afternoon on changes that took place in respect of social security and their effect on Australians who turn 55 years of age. They are particularly nasty. Certainly, I do not think it is overstating it to refer to them as vicious, the changes that occurred on Saturday for Australians who reach the age of 55. I would like to read a letter from today's Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>. I think it really sums up very well the particular feeling of a person who wrote to the newspaper and their concerns at the measure that was introduced on Saturday. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am one of the 67,000 whose allowance has decreased. It makes me wonder what I have done, for this to happen?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm over 55 years old; I've been made redundant (seven years ago); I have searched and searched for a job, without success; I received a small pay&hyphen;out; I've not taken any holiday (i.e. going away) and I have lived sparingly to preserve as much as possible for old age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the age for pension has increased to 65. Now everyone over 55 years in this position is penalised again. There are no rebates except a health care card. My health is the worst it has ever been and up go all the health funds along with many other necessities, just when needed most. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7024">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pass the asset test easily but apparently superannuation, which is less than $100,000 is assessed as bringing in a certain rate&mdash;whether it does or not, whether it crashes or not, whether costs are half of it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't believe after paying hefty taxes for years and struggling to provide security that this is happening. I don't think I deserve it. It is not my fault that I am in this position. I'm dreading ever reaching "old age", I like to be independent. It will be a struggle and everything will happen that I have tried to prevent. I urge others to very, very, wary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is signed: `Disillusioned, vulnerable and feeling very aged'. I hope particularly that Senator Newman, from Launceston in Tasmania, reads that letter today because that sums up, I think, the intense disappointment&mdash;even betrayal&mdash;of the 67,000 Australians. It may be more; we have been given government estimates of 67,000 who have been affected by the measures introduced on Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What were the measures that came into effect on Saturday? They affected a range of income that a person receives once they have reached the age of 55. They include: having received social security payment for nine months, any superannuation or rollover assets will be counted under the social security means test. Depending on the value of their superannuation assets and what other income and assets they have, their payment may be reduced or cancelled completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change under the new income maintenance test is that any cashed out annual leave, sick leave, long service leave or maternity leave included in their redundancy package will preclude any payment for the duration of the leave. Thirdly, under the new liquid assets tests, any liquid assets in excess of $5,000 for a couple, or $2,500 for a single person, would preclude any payments for up to 13 weeks. That is a summary of the changes that commenced last Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means, of course, is that a person who has turned 55&mdash;and I think everyone here would acknowledge this&mdash;is at their most vulnerable in terms of losing their job and of finding alternative employment. If you are made redundant or lose your job at the age of 55, it is not easy to find another job. Unfortu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nately, there is an attitude among many employers that a person who has reached the age of 55 may not be suited to employment altogether, and I think that is a very unfortunate attitude that is widely held amongst Australian employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of problems. Many of the workers who have been made redundant have been involved in traditional trade and non&hyphen;trade blue collar occupations. In many cases they do not have the degree of understanding of computers, for example, that is required in the modern economy. They find it very difficult to re&hyphen;educate or retrain and to adjust to the modern economy. There is a particular problem facing older Australians in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this government's response? As from Saturday, a person who has turned 55 years of age, who may have struggled for much of their working life to put aside moneys for their retirement, in the form of superannuation, finds the goal posts have been shifted. Instead of that superannuation being there for when they want to retire&mdash;when they reach their 60s&mdash;they are now required to draw down in part or whole on that superannuation asset which they have, in many cases, struggled to accumulate over the last 10, 20 or 30 years in the hope that they could build that nest egg up and have it there for their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, many people who have lost their jobs at the age of 55 do not want to retire. They are out there actively seeking alternative employment, as difficult as it is to find that alternative employment. But this government has shifted the goalposts. The government has changed the rules, in effect retrospectively, and said to those people who have struggled for many years, `You will now have to draw down on some or all of your superannuation to survive. If you have been made redundant and have cashed out annual leave, sick leave, long-service leave or maternity leave, you should use that up as well.' I have referred to the liquid assets test of $2,500 for a single person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, these are very nasty and very vicious measures that have been introduced by this government. I have looked 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7025"> through the Liberal Party election manifesto and I certainly cannot see any indication of these measures. The Liberal-National Party government continues to claim that these sorts of changes are fair for elderly Australians. We have had a response to the excuses&mdash;and that is all they are&mdash;that have been presented for these new measures that took effect on Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman has referred time and time again to millionaires rorting the system. As I have mentioned before, in my home state of Tasmania there are many hundreds of people who have been affected by this new measures. There are very few Tasmanians who are millionaires full stop, let alone there are not many millionaires who have been affected by these new measures at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were any truth to that claim, then the government could have, as Labor suggested, exempted persons under a certain level of superannuation asset from being affected by this measure. Labor suggested a superannuation cut-off point of $250,000. Let us get the millionaires out. If you want to hit the millionaires, you can design specific measures to tackle the millionaires&mdash;such as they are in Tasmania; I do not think there would be more than two or three millionaires in Tasmania. Unfortunately, this measure has affected in my home state&mdash;I have not seen the breakdown of figures&mdash;I think, at least 1,500 or 2,000 persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting point about this issue is that there will be an ever increasing number of persons affected by this measure because the current group of people largely affected are people who have acquired superannuation over long periods of time. As I mentioned earlier, Labor introduced national superannuation for all Australian workers. It commenced in the late 1980s, depending upon the particular industry in which a worker was employed. So superannuation for all Australians has been established and will grow and accumulate with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee. As workers reach the age of 55 and lose their jobs, there will be many more&mdash;tens of thousands&mdash;ageing Australians who will be affected by this new measure that commenced last Saturday.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I make about this new measure is that one of the central thrusts of the government has been to encourage and, in some cases by legislation, require people to keep their superannuation until the age of 60. It is proposing to close off, for example, accessing superannuation if you have got less than $500. If you are going overseas, you will not be able to access your superannuation. It is announced that it is going to require preservation of superannuation from age 55 to 60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has the government done with this measure? It has taken a totally contrary approach. It is effectively saying, `When you get to 55 and can't find another job, you have to declare yourself retired to access your superannuation in order to live and survive.' As I have said on many occasions, this is a very nasty and vicious measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To rub salt into the wound, many of the people who have complained to Labor about this measure have locked in their superannuation arrangements for some years in advance. The government introduced the new measure, but they have locked their superannuation into a range of retirement vehicles and now they have to unravel those arrangements in order to access their superannuation. That will come at a cost. They will be charged. There will be a fee for unravelling their superannuation arrangements if they wish to access all or part of it in order to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, this is a very vicious and a very nasty measure that affects tens of thousands of elderly Australians. It has certainly meant a reassessment by many people in the Australian work force who are coming up to the age of 55 about what they can do in terms of saving and their superannuation and about what will happened to their redundancy payments if they are made redundant. This is just a money grab by this government&mdash;I am sure recommended by Treasury. It is uncaring and, above all, it is unfair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ALP is very keen to marginalise groups of Australians and it is doing a disservice to older Australians by this motion. The opposition's suggestion that this government has failed to protect the interests of older Australians is ludicrous. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7026"> concept that Labor has a mortgage on older Australians is wrong. The polls up to the present time have borne this out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People over 50 cannot accept that the agenda followed by the Hawke-Keating government was correct. During those years, Labor tended to become an apologist for almost everything that older Australians thought about what it meant to be an Australian. The latest Newspoll, which breaks up the primary voting intention of people over 50, indicates that as late as April&hyphen;June&mdash;which are the latest figures I have for primary voting intention&mdash;the coalition government had a 16&hyphen;point margin over Labor; that is, a primary vote of 49 to 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The welfare and wellbeing of older Australians has always been one of the coalition's highest priorities, both in opposition and in office&mdash;and well might it be, because we are an ageing population. Labor would have us believe that older Australians had a better deal under them. How is it that the comprehensive review by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) of this country's aged care facilities has found so many substandard operations? Labor had 13 years to fix things up: they did not and could not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is access to medical care, social security benefits, the care of returned service men and women, the concerns of self&hyphen;funded retirees or the provision of aged care, this government is delivering for older Australians and making changes for the better. We have made practical changes that make sense to older people. Just yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched Centrelink, this government's new one&hyphen;stop shop which combines the services previously offered by four government departments. At over 400 offices across the country, many in regional areas, it will be easier for older Australians to get advice and easier for them to organise access to the age pension, the pensioner concession and the Commonwealth seniors health card. This group, perhaps more than any other, will appreciate the convenience and efficiency of these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there is already easier access for older Australians to Medicare claim processing through the introduction of elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tronic lodgment direct from doctors' surgeries and processing of Medicare claims by pharmacies, and this will be expanded. Also, there is a commitment of an additional $10 million over four years for people with dementia and for their carers, $14.7 million has been allocated to further extend funding for the palliative care program in 1997&hyphen;98 and there is funding of $36.7 million over four years for a new national `respite for carers' program which will be established around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made changes to benefit older Australians financially. We have introduced a tax rebate which is equal to the value of the pension tax rebate. Under that scheme, lower income retirees of pension age will be able to receive a tax break of up to $1,229 per year for a single person. The unjust legacy to low income, self&hyphen;funded retirees was discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor taxed self&hyphen;funded retirees at an income level of $5,400 where other pensioners were able to enjoy a tax&hyphen;free income level of $11,185. This was unfair. The coalition reversed the ALP's policy and now Australians who have saved for their own retirement have seen their tax&hyphen;free income increase to $11,185 per annum for singles and $19,850 for couples. This is not to say that we are leaving aside those people who do not have some income and therefore qualify as self&hyphen;funded retirees. We are interested in all older people, but, in the interests of the way that the government dollar is spent, we must be fair. Under the previous government's arrangements, they tended to pick winners and certainly were not fair in the way that some of their policies were administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the May 1997 budget, the government introduced a new savings rebate which will enable people to claim a 15 per cent rebate on up to $3,000 of savings interest, equivalent to a tax cut of up to $450 a year. The National President of the Association of Independent Retirees, Mr Ray Trestrail, believes many of his group's members will benefit from this move. He was not the only one to applaud the government's efforts to encourage national savings and reduce our debt. Clearly one of the very big important issues that we face is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7027"> to increase our national savings and reduce our debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has also delivered on a promise that the previous government was not prepared to make. We propose legislation&mdash;which has been passed in the House of Representatives&mdash;which will make sure that the value of the age pension is maintained at 25 per cent of male total weekly earnings. That is something which is to be applauded and something which all older people on the pension are very pleased about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, early in our term this government took a very hard look at the provision of aged care in the community. Generally speaking we found it in a parlous state and took immediate action to improve it. We have extended the existing entry contribution system that applies to hostels to cover nursing homes from 1 October. An accommodation bond will be payable to enter certified nursing homes. The accommodation bond will not affect current residents in nursing homes. For them, nothing will change. Anyone who has assets of less than $22,500 or is in a financially disadvantaged state will not be charged an accommodation bond. To suggest otherwise is scaremongering and inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast this with the ALP's response to the needs of our ageing population: they cut funding on capital expenditure while not allowing nursing home operators to charge a bond. We are about providing help where it is needed and also about using the taxpayer's dollar wisely. Community responsibility is important. Australia was substantially built on it and recognises it, and all decisions that we will make will be based on that sense of community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes suffered under Labor. In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 million was available for nursing home capital purposes. By 1995&hyphen;96, this figure had dropped to $10.7 million, a startling fall of 75 per cent. But the worst part is that this figure only included $2.7 million for upgrading old and substandard services. The rest was for new construction work. The result was that too many nursing homes do not meet acceptable, basic standards on fire safety, on privacy, on space and on facilities. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There was, and unfortunately remains, an urgent need for action. We are addressing that need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has tried to frustrate us at every turn. Rather than admitting their failing, they have put their energy into scaremongering and misinformation campaigns designed to frighten older Australians&mdash;and, of course, they are the easiest target of all to frighten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is in touch with the needs of older Australians. Many of them told us that they were in no rush to retire, so we developed a deferred pension bonus plan to benefit them. I commend this decision; it is a great idea. I am sure that the previous government would have liked to have thought of it, and I would have applauded them if they had. The plan operates on the basis that, if you choose to stay at work for at least 25 hours a week, the government will pay you a bonus of 9.4 per cent of the basic age or service pension. It is paid as a tax&hyphen;free lump sum when you take the pension later on. If you do your sums on that, it means that if a single person chose to keep working for an extra five years after the normal pension age, they would receive a tax&hyphen;free bonus of $21,250, which is a very substantial amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is committed to meeting the needs and aspirations of all older Australians. We are committed to providing proper care and facilities, no matter where older Australians may be living. The assertions put forward by Senator Neal and subsequent speakers really are baseless. In addition, we have provided a generous package targeted at carers and the people they care for, which focuses on their needs, respite care, and financial assistance for carers, and on carers who need assessment, information and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For carers themselves, additional financial assistance came in the carers' package in the recent budget. It includes a $16.60 per fortnight increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit; the extension of the carer payment to a carer providing constant care of a child under 16 years with profound disabilities; extension of the carer payment to a carer who is required to care for an adult as well as the care of, or supervision of the care of, a child; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7028"> and the alignment of the arrangements which allow someone to be temporarily out of care for 63 days a year before the payment to the carer is affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have provided further assistance for care of dementia sufferers. We will provide $10 million over four years to provide for the more accurate diagnosis and assessment of people with dementia. For their carers, more appropriate and timely treatment, care and support services will also be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the child disability allowance criteria will result in fairer and better targeting of the allowance. And, in a very important area of support and information for carers, more than $8 million over four years has been allocated to provide support and information to carers, including resource material in English and, very importantly, in other languages; information about government services; health information; and support for carer networks and volunteer training. In addition to the national respite for carers program which was announced in the budget, there will be funding of nearly $37 million over four years for the new national respite for carers program, which will soon be established right around the country. There has been an allocation of $54 million over four years to state and territory governments for accommodation support to assist an additional 500 people with severe and profound disabilities and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older Australians, including those on fixed incomes, will benefit by up to $450 per year due to the tax cut on savings interest or personal superannuation contributions. As I have said, the government is offering a bonus to many Australians who are able and keen to work past 65 years of age. The deferred pension bonus plan will pay a bonus to people of age or service pension age who defer the pension and who continue in gainful employment for at least 25 hours a week. The bonus will be 9.5 per cent of the basic age or service pension entitlement for each year of pension deferral, up to a maximum of five years. In addition, there is much easier access for older Australians to Medicare claims processing through the introduction of elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tronic lodgment direct from doctors' surgeries, and from the processing of Medicare claims through pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another election commitment which we have honoured is the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, which has already been legislated by the parliament and took effect on 1 July last year. This will provide an effective tax cut to provisional taxpayers of some $180 million over the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, and it represents an important reduction in the provisional tax burden. This will be of benefit to many self&hyphen;funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent budget, the government announced reforms to the social security means testing of income stream products such as superannuation pensions and annuities. These reforms will ensure that people with money invested in income streams that provide an orderly draw down of capital over the expected retirement period, and which allow no further access to that money, will not have that money treated as an asset under the means test. This will be the case even if the money invested is from non&hyphen;superannuation savings. These changes aim to ensure that the means testing of income streams is consistent and equitable, and that it offers fair treatment to those retirees who have made provision for their retirement period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also aware that the cost of private health insurance is a burden for many retirees, and it will be meeting its commitment to provide incentives for private health insurance. The incentives will address the ongoing decline in private health insurance membership by reducing the costs of private health insurance for low&hyphen; and middle&hyphen;income families and individuals. The incentives will be available to single people with a taxable income up to $35,000, and to couples and families with dependent children and a combined taxable income of up to $70,000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In taking note of the advances to the Minister for Finance, I particularly want to address the advance to the Department of Transport and Regional Development, which goes to the payment of the Bass Strait passenger equalisation scheme, which was introduced on 1 September 1996 for the purpose of reducing the cost for motorists of transporting accompanied vehicles when travelling across Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme was aimed at increasing demand for travel across Bass Strait, with direct benefits to the tourist industry and a potential growth in jobs. The budget allocation for the year 1996&hyphen;97 was $7&half; million, and it would appear that the scheme is now running over budget. The point that needs to be made with regard to that is that there has not been any real net increase in tourism. What appears to have been happening&mdash;maybe this is something that the government needs to check&mdash;is that people numbers per vehicle have actually decreased. Therefore, it would seem that this scheme and the quite substantial amount of money being used to fund it is certainly not achieving the desired objective. The scheme may well be being misused by some car selling companies that have one person who drives a vehicle on to the boat and travels across. I understand from reports that this is particularly so with regard to second hand cars where, for instance, cars are being bought in Melbourne at reasonable prices by some Tasmanian dealers and are being brought across to Tasmania more cheaply than they otherwise would do so. The dealers then make an increased profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government took a reasonable approach in trying to bring down the costs of travel across the Bass Strait, which is very important to people of Tasmania. But we want to avoid all these hucksters and remove the possibility of this scheme being pulled apart.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could end up being the jeremiad of Tasmania, and we could end up seeing the whole scheme being eviscerated. Nevertheless, what is important is that Tasmania was deserving of getting some form of subsidy for travel across the Bass Strait, because that is a major impediment to the state. Before the last federal election, we proposed to pay for a new catamaran to operate on the service. The one benefit that that would have had, and would still have, over the current scheme is that it would have helped the state to replace the existing vessel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing vessel has a substantial amount of debt and it is in decline. When the government chooses a time to replace it, it will probably lose a substantial amount of money. We will still have the subsidy, but what would be more important for the state in the longer term would be to have a different application. Fast ferries&mdash;I am not necessarily talking about catamaran&hyphen;style ferries&mdash;do have the potential to provide a more efficient, faster and cheaper service. That would be a cheaper service for everybody, not just for those bringing across motor vehicles. All this subsidy does is provide a benefit in relation to motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to very carefully watch how this scheme runs. It is already running at about $1.2 million over budget. I want to make sure that Tasmania gets the appropriate benefit from this sort of budgetary expenditure.  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since they were elected they have come into this parliament and made change after change; people have become more and more worse off, yet they still pretend that the position they have delivered does not mean that people will be worse off.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This latest report highlights the unfairness and the attempt to eviscerate people's superannuation plans. Australians who go overseas are no longer able to get access to their superannuation. It does not matter if they are coming back, it does not matter that they have to contribute to superannuation in the country that they go to; they cannot get their superannuation from Australia&mdash;it has to sit here. Fees have to be paid and the total amount will possibly go backwards because this government is so small&hyphen;minded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another situation. When temporary workers from overseas come here it does not matter whether the workers have to contribute to superannuation in their home country; what matters is that they have to contribute to superannuation here&mdash;they have to contribute twice. There was a suggestion that we could negotiate with all countries to try to get some equity into the situation, but we would have years and years of bilateral negotiations that would get us nowhere. This government is mean spirited and very vicious in its approach to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report highlights broken promises. The government pretended that it had a black hole that it had to fill; it pretended that it had to deal with an economy that was in trouble, in debt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think `huckster' is the word in vogue today. I am not sure whether `hucksterism' is an appropriate word to use in the English language. There was a considerable amount of aggressive selling of superannuation products. It does go on today, to some extent, but it is much more minimal, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I am pleased to say&mdash;in large part because of the reforms of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to traverse the mis&hyphen;selling, the over&hyphen;selling or the wrongful charging that occurred in respect of some superannuation products in the past. Suffice to say that, when the three measures proposed by the government in the last budget were examined by the Senate select committee, I do not think it was realised by the persons affected by these three measures that the measures could be carried out by regulation. There was no legislation required. The announcements were made and then almost overnight, with very little notice, they were implemented by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave notice today that next Monday I will be moving the disallowance of these regulations. We have only two options with respect to regulations. We either approve them by not disallowing them, or when we disallow them we have to disallow them as a whole; we cannot amend the regulations. Labor members, including my colleagues Senator Chris Evans and Senator Steve Conroy who serve on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, heard over a period of days extensive and highly critical evidence and damning comments about the three changes that the government has proposed. So we are in a position where we cannot amend the regulations; we have to disallow them as a whole and hope that the government sees commonsense and that the government takes some notice of the recommendations made in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the small amounts&mdash;amounts under $500&mdash;in the past, persons who had less than $500 could eviscerate their superannuation accounts. You have to ask yourself why this was allowed. In reality, there is little sense in forcing most people to keep small amounts of $500 or less. The amount of accrued interest, offset by administrative fees and charges over time, really means that small amounts such as $500 or less are not going to make any significant contribution to superannuation retirement savings&mdash;either in total or for the individual in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked questions about the modelling of the specific increase in national savings as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7033"> result of the measure in respect of amounts of less than $500. Whilst the government attempted to assure us that the general and other changes in the budget will lead to an increase in national saving, they are very reluctant to give us the very precise detail. In fact, most of the increases in superannuation national savings that result from the last budget announcements occur because of the critical measure that Labor introduced, which was the superannuation guarantee&mdash;currently six per cent, rising to nine per cent by the year 2002. We heard a series of submissions and very long and loud complaints about the proposals that the committee examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue relates to transferring money overseas. A number of individuals and companies made representations to us. I think what concerned Labor senators, particularly in respect of Australian citizens, was that a number of people have encountered the following kind of problem. I have had two former police officers from Tasmania contact me. One was planning to move to New Zealand; one was planning to go to the United Kingdom. They had retired from the police force, had received their moneys and were all set to go, taking their superannuation with them. One of them wants to set up a small business; the other wants to remarry in the United Kingdom. Their plans have been totally disrupted by the government's new regulations, which prevent them from taking their money. If these sorts of changes are to be made, you would think that the government would give some sort of reasonable notice period&mdash;at least for those people who have put plans to leave the country in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measure in respect of transferring assets of superannuation out of the country related to temporary residence. We have a visa system of temporary residence. This largely involves skills that are not attainable or are in short supply in Australia. We had an interesting presentation from the American Chamber of Commerce represented by Mr Blunt. Some members would recall that Mr Blunt was a former Leader of the National Party. I do not know whether he is still a card&hyphen;carrying member of the National Party, but I have rarely seen a person so comprehen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sively criticise such a measure and its effect. I do not think Mr Blunt used the description `jeremiad'; he definitely did not use that word. But we got a very long, incisive, mournful collection of complaints from  Mr Blunt&mdash;justified complaints. He pointed out that when chief executives come into this country, they have employment contracts that stipulate<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that, when they leave the country, they can either take their superannuation or, if they take it, they may have to pay it to their employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point was that the government's new regulations are overriding existing contracts of employment. I suppose if compromise were possible on this measure the compromise should be that it should apply to new contracts of employment. So when a person comes in from overseas, if the government is to apply this measure, it should apply to new contracts of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argues that it needs this measure to hold these moneys in Australia, because it wants to negotiate social security arrangements with other countries. There may be some validity to that, although there was precious little evidence given to the committee about this. In fact, contradictory evidence was given by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs&mdash;much to the embarrassment of the Department of Social Security, I think&mdash;about the alleged grounds for requiring all future superannuation to be kept in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Blunt certainly well and truly bagged Mr Costello and the government. He said it overrode existing contracts; it was the sort of practice that occurred in Third World countries; the members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia were absolutely outraged by this measure; it was affecting investment opportunities; and it was affecting Australia's ability to attract foreign headquarters. I have rarely seen such a comprehensive criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third measure was the hardship provisions. I am sure that if any of my colleagues are going to speak on that aspect of the report they can well and truly cover the issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I would not say I was provoked into speaking on this report, but I was disappointed to hear Senator Conroy, who is a member of that committee, in his youthful exuberance&mdash;some would say it is youthful exuberance; he either tends to be youthfully exuberant or an angry young man, and I guess after he has spent some more time in this place, he will probably mature a little&mdash;attempt to trivialise some of the matters raised in that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That scenario was brought about by the fact that I think Senator Conroy found a dictionary today for the first time in his life.

If a senator chooses to trivialise a report like this by trying to inject into the debate what he would consider to be schoolboy humour, I think it takes away from the work that has been done by this committee in bringing down its 26th report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I want to refer to is Senator Sherry's remarks about the fact that, from the days of the inception of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, there was a great deal of bipartisanship&mdash;and there was&mdash;all along the way, because everybody knew there were a lot of major changes that needed to be made to superannuation. Many of those changes were made in a very bipartisan way because people knew changes had to be made. Some of the issues that are now coming before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation are not major issues, as they were in the early days, but they are issues which will try to refine the existing legislation that we have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Senator Sherry's and the Labor Party's view of a bipartisan approach is that, when you are in government and the opposition of the day actually does its best to have a bipartisan approach, you have what is called a bipartisan approach to superannuation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I got on this committee almost as soon as I got into this parliament, Senator Sherry, and I can tell you that the opposition in those days went out of its way to make sure the reports that came down from that Senate committee were as bipartisan as they possibly could be. In the 12 reports I was involved in in that three&hyphen;year period, I believe there was only one that was not unanimous&mdash;I stand corrected, but I think there was only one&mdash;because of the degree of bipartisanship that the then opposition, which was us, was prepared to put into the work of that committee to make sure the reports were for the benefit of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say that an issue that has been raised a couple of times&mdash;and this is not directly related to this report, but it was raised by Senator Conroy in his little contribution to this debate&mdash;is the issue of the people who are being forced to access rollover accounts or superannuation assets if they are over 55 and have been out of work for more than nine months. That came into effect on 20 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that, whenever this is raised, people talk about workers' accounts and the amount workers have in these small superannuation funds. Having been involved in the superannuation industry for some seven years prior to coming into this place, I know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7035"> for a fact that most of the accounts people are now being asked to draw on&mdash;particularly any that have been in place for a long time&mdash;are self-employed accounts. A lot of people who reach the age of 55 have little or no super, so they are not affected by the changes made by this government and recently announced by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the history of the superannuation changes and the fact it has taken a long time to get more universality in superannuation, many people chose to provide for their retirement in other ways. Many of them chose to provide for their retirement by selling their small business and using the asset to provide them with some retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see any reason why a person who sells an asset and uses that as their retirement income should be treated differently from someone who has put all their money into a superannuation fund, as such, and is asked to access it. If people have saved for their retirement and they are not in a superannuation fund, once they reach the age of 55, they are required to take those assets into account when working out whether they are entitled to get any government benefit by way of social security. They are required to take those into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what the opposition is saying is that, if it happens to be in a superannuation account, you should not have to take it into your assets. So you are differentiating between people who have retirement benefits in a superannuation fund and people who have provided for their retirement income in another way outside of a superannuation fund. In many cases, they are using that asset to provide themselves with a retirement income without any help&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that the whole issue of a bipartisan attitude to superannuation is one that I believe the government, the opposition and the Democrats should consider more carefully when dealing with issues which are what I would call, in many cases, to do with the finetuning of the superannuation policy. Much of our superannuation policy was brought in with bipartisan support from the period of the late 1980s through to 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some issues which we as a party opposed. We opposed them on principle but, once they were put in place by the previous Labor government, we accepted that, in order to provide some certainty for people in the community, we would not seek to change them&mdash;particularly the superannuation guarantee charge, which, as you know, in the early days was not part of coalition policy. But, once it was put in place, our parties decided that, in order to provide some certainty for people who were involved in superannuation contributions, it should be left in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only things that this government has changed, which have been changed only in very recent times, are issues which we do not think are completely fair. The issue that I raised, Senator Conroy&mdash;I am not sure you were here when I referred to it&mdash;was how we treat people who have reached the age of 55 and who may not be using superannuation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7036"> provide their retirement income but may have to rely on assets that have been accumulated in some other way, which was the only way that was available to many people prior to the early 1980s when superannuation became more universal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the previous government did some very good things for superannuation, and I would congratulate them on the work that they did. They should not now try to restrict this government, it having been elected, from making some changes which we think will further benefit and refine the superannuation system. We do not expect you to agree with all the things that we want to do, in the same way that we did not agree with all the things that you wanted to do. But, having done them, we were prepared to let them stay in place for the sake of those people who are now involved in far more universal superannuation coverage, I agree, than was ever available prior to the early 1980s and the mid-1980s when I became involved in the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry, if you are looking for bipartisanship, you are the ones who can provide it. Bipartisanship is a two-way thing, not a one-way thing. It would do you good to look back and see the bipartisan approach that was taken to all these matters by the coalition when it was in opposition and perhaps model some of your attitudes towards changes to superannuation on the way you were treated when you were in government until 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that I appreciate now your advice in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President, as distinct from your immediately prior statement in your capacity as a senator. I felt that it was appropriate to draw to the attention of the Senate that it is a question of understanding the meaning of the word. I think that, in the context of the debate, that meaning has been made quite clear. In that respect, I would say that it is quite arguable as to whether those comments are entitled to be made in the way that Senator Conroy made them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, can I say that I would accept that it is desirable that the committees of the Senate, in reviewing matters, strive as far as is possible within the context of the material before them to have a common view on the outcome of any particular inquiry. Of course, that is not always possible. In debates such as these, which enable members of the Senate to comment upon reports of committees, I think matters are open to overt or alternative views&mdash;and, indeed, the evidence, which is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, which might reflect upon a position of one party or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be that in the past there has not been a great deal of disagreement about the streamlining of the superannuation system. I think that is probably the best way I can describe your description of what occurred in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7037"> the 12 reports that the committee has made whilst you have been participating and in opposition. Having been involved in negotiations on behalf of employees over many years in relation to their superannuation entitlements, I can recall talking to one major international company who, when asked about superannuation and trying to improve the benefits of employees, said, `That's not a matter that we even want to discuss.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things have come a long way since that time. There have been High Court cases about superannuation, and there is no doubt that the work of the committee has been very important in bringing superannuation to the point that it is at now. Others can be very proud of the work that you have done to bring superannuation, which is now available for the overwhelming majority of Australians&mdash;and that was something that was not the case in the past&mdash;to the point that it is at now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is arguable that some of the changes the government is making to the superannuation system in this country will fundamentally alter the system. I would suggest that the proposals which are being put forward about, for example, the question of choice of superannuation funds could lead to a great risk of a fall in the confidence of ordinary employees in the superannuation system. I saw an article in a paper last week which talked about whether employers might find themselves the subject of legal action for their advice on the availability of super schemes were they to offer their employees a choice of fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a pursuit of the issue of choice without a real understanding and pursuit of the issue of how people in the community understand superannuation and how they will make an informed choice. It is realistic to say that it is important that, when these matters are considered by the Senate, there is consensus about this issue. It is important because this government needs, whether it considers it has a mandate or not, to consider whether it is going to make changes which will eviscerate the superannuation system in this country and which will undermine its credibility with ordinary people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation system which has been created is the envy of a great many countries. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have established&mdash;and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, have been part of this&mdash;a superannuation system which provides a retirement income base for a country with an aging population. I have been to superannuation conferences where representatives of superannuation industries in other countries have frankly said that we have got the Rolls Royce model and that they are a long way behind, and I am talking about countries with their own pension funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is wrong in this chamber to raise issues on superannuation which are matters of debate between the parties. But I do accept the point that you make that we should try, as far as is possible, to have consensus on the streamlining of the system so that we continue to have a superannuation system which is the envy of the rest of the world. We can say with pride that we have had a part in creating and directing a system to meet the needs of this country in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this system breaks down we will have people bemoaning the fact that we do not have an adequate retirement incomes policy and the tax system is unable to cater for the ageing population of Australia. That is the issue that we have to grapple with. We should not undermine confidence in the system, because, if we do, we will be emitting a jeremiad for the industry in the future.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7038">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took note of Senator Ferguson's earlier comments about the importance of committee bipartisanship and how productive Senate committees can be when they deal with matters in a bipartisan way. I think it is important to note that, in relation to the Senate Economics References Committee's work and deliberations in this matter, there was, on the whole, apart from a couple of small exceptions, a bipartisan approach to this report.

We certainly hope that he will join with us in trying to get some more out of the government, so to speak, in terms of its response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, no, Senator Mackay. The committee's work was certainly bipartisan. When it moved beyond that, unfortunately the government did not adequately respond to the considerable effort that was put in by senators from the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats. I seem to recall that Senator Murray also spoke on the report when it was tabled. He indicated an element of disappointment, probably more on behalf of former Senator Sid Spindler who was involved in a crusade, in a sense, in this area during his term in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should perhaps remind the Senate that the description that this sector of the textile, clothing and footwear industries put to the committee of how work is organised within this committee could be depicted as involving a number of hucksters. I am sure it is parliamentary to use that word in that sense since I am not actually describing another senator or a member in the other chamber. Unfortunately, the government's response to the report did not even acknowledge the level of concern raised by the committee about some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the conduct or practices that exist and certainly did not follow on from that by recognising that particular initiatives needed to be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I last spoke on this report it was before the government had responded to the Industry Commission report on the textile, clothing and footwear industries relating to tariffs. At the time I was fearful that their response in relation to this report might bode ill for the sort of response which might come down in that area. I am pleased to say that since that time the government has in fact been convinced a new approach should be applied to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. I am hopeful now that the government might give some further consideration to our recommendations in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope the government looks at some of the issues that relate to outworkers in the context that some of the problems relate to adjustment which has occurred in the industry as a consequence of the reduction in tariffs to date; namely, to continue to exist in some sectors of the industry some employers have contracted their work to outworkers who, because of how the industry is organised, are often employed in very poor circumstances. In fact, there is confusion amongst many in the industry about whether workers are actually employees or contractors. That was one of the areas where we thought the government should do more to resolve that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the nature of the work in this industry you could say that some seem to expect workers in this area to eviscerate themselves to get a dollar. In particular, some migrant women spend very, very long hours working for very, very small amounts of money&mdash;often as low as about $2 an hour. Again, they worked very long hours because of tight time frames and it also involved the care of young children. Young children themselves were performing the work as well. So a child labour issue was also dealt with by the committee and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the TCF issues, I think it is important to realise that the government's response on TCF industry tariffs is not the only issue. It was only earlier this week we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7039"> were dealing with the question of China. The Textile Council, the group of textile manufacturers, made a submission to that inquiry highlighting an example, for instance, where Australia could end up being flooded with cotton products under the current proposals for anti-dumping legislation. The Chinese government continues to control the price of these products by controlling the price of inputs, such as cotton, and sets up commercial type enterprises which simply hem the products, so to speak, and then send them offshore. Obviously the price is going to be significantly less than what our textile manufacturers can compete with here. The textile industry manufacturers were very concerned that they could be competing unfairly if proposed changes to the anti-dumping laws go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I can make in relation to this report is that the committee has undertaken to review what transpires in the industry in the 12 months since we last reported. That will occur later this year. In that review we will be able to assess what progress has been made in relation to a voluntary code of practice. Obviously, if very little progress has been able to occur, the committee may want to address what other measures might be necessary of a more or less voluntary nature to get some movement in relation to some of the exploitation that occurs in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to that review and hope, to take up your point, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, that we will still  be able to address this issue in a bipartisan fashion. I also hope that the government will consider that as a significant issue in its response and perhaps take more note than the several notes which appeared in this last report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to comment tonight on the new structure of the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. I know that some scorn has been heaped on the fact that the name is not very different. But, of course, the new commission symbolises a shift to the community assuming some broader responsibility for combating discrimination rather than the outdated perception of the commission as a Lone Ranger battling against the odds single&hyphen;handedly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new commission consists of a president and three deputy presidents. One deputy president will be assigned responsibility for sex discrimination and equal opportunity, one will be allocated human rights and disability discrimination, and the other will be responsible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice and race discrimination. The new structure will retain all the best features of the current system while adding a more focused and streamlined approach to the protection and promotion of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new structure ensures that the commission serves all Australians without requiring individuals to fit into pigeon holes. It will also assist in removing perceptions that the commission seeks only to protect those in the community for whom a specific commissioner exists. This is surely a valuable measure in encouraging some community ownership over the serious problem and perpetuation of discrimination. In a recent interview, the Attorney&hyphen;General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an individual has a right, then the community or people in the community have the responsibility. We ought to have a greater focus on the community side. We ought to be&mdash;the Commission to be assisting business, assisting Government and assisting the community. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7042">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is the rationale behind the restructure? Firstly, the motivation behind the new structure is about efficiency. I do not mean saving a buck or two here or there but taking the necessary steps to ensure that the protection and promotion of human rights can be managed quickly and effectively to the benefit of all Australians. It is no secret that the commission in its past had its problems. No&hyphen;one, I think, ever pretended it was perfect. Sir Ronald Wilson made no secret of that fact before the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade last year, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the amendments made a year or two ago required the commission to demonstrate a collegialty. It was a shame really and an embarrassment that it was considered necessary to incorporate that in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no doubt that the structure of the commission has caused some problems for consumers. Yesterday's press release by the Law Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The old Commission&mdash;where there were separate Commissioners for each area of human rights&mdash;was not administratively ideal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, it was not the best structure when a particular case raised various aspects of human rights and equal opportunity law. Cases like that should not be split up between specialist agencies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second rationalisation for the restructure is to review the commission's unprecedented growth, especially in light of the transfer of the hearing of complaints from the commission to the Federal Court as a constitutional requirement after the High Court ruling in the Brandy case found that the commission has no constitutional power to enforce decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last decade the commission's growth had been disproportionate to other areas of government. Over the past nine years funding to the former HREOC had increased from about $4 million to more than $20 million. Over the same period staff increased from 51 to 200, at one stage exceeding 220. Growth, of course, by itself is not a bad thing, but there were some serious concerns as to the use being made of the commission. For example, it has been reported that since the Racial Discrimination Act administered by the commission was passed 20 years ago only 20 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cases that had gone to a public hearing had been upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that the commission's top heavy structure was probably unnecessary and certainly unstainable, and I am pleased to report that the role of education and prevention will be strengthened. The commission will retain its current powers to investigate and conciliate complaints, but will also have an important role in both education and prevention. No longer hampered by structural problems which have beset the commission in the past, the deputy presidents will be free to play a prominent role in educating business and the community and in setting out guidelines to actually avoid discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean for women? It constantly amazes me that commentators and critics alike assert that the Howard government would deliberately or intentionally alienate its largest constituency base&mdash;women, who now make up 50.5 per cent of the Australian population. The changes to the commission that I am outlining are good news for women. The enhanced educative function means that for women, in particular, changing the culture of the workplace does not have to wait until a complaint about discrimination is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake&mdash;in 1995&hyphen;96 sexual harassment continued to be the largest single ground of complaint, comprising 48 per cent of complaints under the Sex Discrimination Act. While sexual harassment is an ongoing issue for women, and to a lesser extent for men, the commission's 1995-96 annual report suggests that the number of conciliated outcomes, private settlements and withdrawals tends to indicate a better understanding of the legislation by all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is encouraging to note that the feedback on the restructure so far is positive. The commission described the restructure as a welcome compromise and stated that `the maintenance of some degree of specialisation is a positive recognition of the needs of people who are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged'. Mr Brett Walker SC from the Law Council of Australia welcomed the announcement when he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7043">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the new Commission with overall responsibility&mdash;but with three deputy presidents each having responsibility for various areas of human rights, rather than one mutually exclusive area&mdash;is a sensible reform, and one which the Law Council has favoured for some time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, as expected, the opposition continue to try to rain on the government's parade without much success. The claim by the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General and shadow Minister for Justice, Senator Bolkus, that up to 43 per cent has been cut from the commission's budget is clearly unsustainable. The reduction in the commission's budget amounts in real terms to about 27 per cent&mdash;not the 40 per cent or more some people have claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the opposition has been running a scare campaign that has needlessly caused anxiety amongst specific community groups. Certainly, it got a lot of women anxious. I have had a lot of correspondence. I say to the Physical Disability Council of Australia, which has recently written to me about its concerns, that the government has no intention of withdrawing its commitment to facilitating the social and workplace participation of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister's appointee, I am a director on the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment. In that capacity I recognise, as does the government, the vital role that the commission has played in encouraging business to develop action plans under the Disability Discrimination Act to eliminate discrimination in the workplace. I look forward to greater gains being made in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission is a watchdog worth saving. The reforms under way will strengthen the role of the commission as a strong and independent champion of human rights in Australia and as a model for our neighbours in the region.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7043"><TITLE>Travel Allowances</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight about `Travelgate'. We have a situation now where the federal opposition is on a hat trick&mdash;Mr Sharp gone, Mr Jull gone and Mr McGauran about to go. We have witnessed extraordinary events in the Australian parliament today. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a government in total and complete disarray. Now, on top of all that has happened, we know that one of the Prime Minister's most senior advisers was informed of Mr Sharp's dodgy travel claims, and his underhand and covered&hyphen;up repayment back in May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing less than a full, open, honest, transparent and legal inquiry will be satisfactory now for the issues that have been raised in parliament over the past four days to be addressed. The inquiry that Mr Howard has established&mdash;the investigation by the Auditor-General&mdash;obviously, is not satisfactory. Its terms of reference are too limited. It must be a full legal inquiry. The terms of reference that Mr Howard has devised need to be extended to Mr McGauran. Obviously, the terms of reference have to be expanded to include the period from 1 January 1992 to 24 September 1997 to be consistent with the period covered by the travel details tabled by Mr Jull on 29 May this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be full access to Mr McGauran's and Mr Sharp's Comcar records, charter aircraft records, DAS fuel card records, original travel claim forms and much other material. There also needs to be a correlation of all charter flights undertaken by Mr Sharp and Mr McGauran and their travel allowance claims. Only a full legal inquiry with adequate terms of reference can get to the bottom of the issues that have now been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight we have the extraordinary situation where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has indicated that two staff members in his own office were informed about this matter. What was the motive of Mr Jull's senior adviser, Mr John Sutherland, in revealing today that he had briefed the Prime Minister's senior adviser and the Prime Minister's closest confidant, Mr Grahame Morris, and the Prime Minister's office manager, Ms Fiona McKenna, on the Sharp affair in May this year? That needs to be established. When was the Prime Minister given Mr Sutherland's statement?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask: how can we believe that Grahame Morris and Fiona McKenna did not pass information of such enormous sensitivity on to the Prime Minister? Are they also claiming amnesia? The Prime Minister tells us that he was not informed and he tells us, I understand, that both Mr Morris and Ms McKenna confirm that this is the case. There really is a recurrence of the sort of amnesia we saw in the Prime Minister's office over the Bob Woods affair. We are dealing with a particularly contagious form of amnesia that appears to have completely spread through the Prime Minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we really believe, at the meetings which the Prime Minister has admitted to having with Mr Jull and Mr Sutherland over the Sharp affair, that neither Mr Sutherland nor Mr Jull referred to the May briefing of Grahame Morris and Fiona McKenna? We know that Grahame Morris was present at these meetings. We have read that in the newspaper. Why did he not mention that he had been made aware of this affair back in May?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is typical of the track record of Mr Morris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Mr Morris is very close to the Prime Minister; we know he is his closest political adviser and closest confidante in this place. This is the same Mr Morris who ran the sleaziest, most vicious advertising campaign ever seen in Australian politics in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory. This is the same Mr Morris who put the fix on the DDB Needham, Burson&hyphen;Marsteller guns buy&hyphen;back campaign, along with a couple of members of the parliamentary Liberal Party, to make sure that Liberal mates received $2 million for their advertising contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same Mr Grahame Morris who was responsible for trying to stitch up one of Australia's most senior political journalists, Kerry O'Brien, in the Senate estimates committee when even two Liberal senators, Senator Coonan and Senator Eggleston, would not swallow the line of questioning that had been passed to them by Mr Morris. We read reports in Wednesday's newspapers that Mr Morris participated in the deliberations where decisions were made to sack Ministers Sharp and Jull. `Locked in a meeting with them,' it said. It is inconceivable that he had not told the Prime Minister that he knew already. This is what we are being asked to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inconceivable that this so&hyphen;called professional, political operator, the mastermind of so many political campaigns for the Liberal Party, did not front up and tell his boss. These were meetings about the sacking of Mr Jull and Mr Sharp&mdash;that is what they were for&mdash;with, amongst others, the Liberal Party's most senior political adviser, the Liberal Party's most senior machine figure in this country. When we found out, after the cover&hyphen;up was exposed, Mr Howard sacked, eventually, his two ministers&mdash;after Laurie Oakes exposed what was happening. Mr Sharp was sacked; Mr Jull was sacked. Why has Mr Morris not been sacked? That is the question, Madam Deputy President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a situation where this government is in total disarray. This is a government out of control. This is a government now paying the price for its lack of understanding of and respect for due process and transparency which was most obvious and started right here when Senator Colston's vote was bought for the deputy presidency of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself has to take responsibility for this state of affairs. He has now revealed that his most senior advisers are implicated at the very heart of this affair. At the very heart of the matter, the cover&hyphen;up, the

That was the finding of the Marks royal commission. The previous government took no action whatsoever on Carmen Lawrence, and were prepared to let their own standards be quite evident to the Australian public. They had no standards of propriety at all. Their propriety extended to agreeing to cover the costs of her appearance before a royal commission, but the Senate voted against funding her appeal against its establishment. An amount of $560,000 of debt remains to be paid, with the Commonwealth only agreeing to meet $50,000 of it, on the grounds that the Carmen

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook still insists it was a kangaroo court. That is the sort of thing we would expect from the opposition because they had no standards of propriety whatsoever when they were in government. Yet what did we have in the situation on Tuesday when Minister John Sharp resigned his position? He had voluntarily repaid amounts, because the situation could bring some embarrassment to the government. Yet not once, on any occasion, did we see the sorts of standards which are expected of this government by those opposite ever applying to themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They never tabled in the parliament their travel allowance details. It was not until this government came into being and got travelling allowances actually tabled in parliament that we could see exactly the extent to which they had used travel allowances for their own benefit. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not want to quote some of the high amounts for ministerial travel within Australia&mdash;except ones that have been quoted before. Senator Sherry's $41,000 as a parliamentary secretary, of course, was a well&hyphen;known average. But there was no public scrutiny of that by the parliament because, in those days, they were not put down. So you see, Madam Deputy President, that the standards of propriety which are required by this government are far in excess of any standards of propriety that were ever accepted or demanded by the previous government of its ministers or, indeed, its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do remember, if we would like to go that far back, the initial discrepancies in Senator Colston's allowances, but no mention of that was made at all by the previous government. There was no mention at all of Senator Colston, when he was a Labor senator, repaying money to DAS for amounts which had been over&hyphen;claimed. Yet because of the publishing of travel allowance details, and because they are freely available for everybody to scrutinise, a minister goes back of his own free will to check and make sure that his claims were in order, and then voluntarily repays that amount, which he said may have been an over&hyphen;claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Processes have been put in place for an investigation by the Auditor&hyphen;General to see what actually took place. When the Auditor&hyphen;General has had the opportunity to go through the whole situation that has occurred with regard to the resignation of these two ministers, and makes his report, only then will you be able to pass judgment as to what exactly took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to come in here and talk about ministers who have resigned this week&mdash;ministers who, because of a situation which has developed through the publication of these travelling allowances, have decided that they would resign because those are the standards of propriety that are required by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister himself has demanded those standards, and at all times the Prime Minister has been able to achieve those standards by acting very quickly whenever there was any public perception regarding these matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7047">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can even go to Laurie Oakes, the person who originally brought this to the public in his article; you people would have known nothing about it if Laurie Oakes had not done his work as a journalist. In his article, Mr Oakes said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sharp himself says that, when the T/A claim records were sent to his office for checking in May, he told a staffer to go through them carefully and delete any claims for any overnight stays about which there was any doubt at all. As he explains it: "I said, `I don't want an argument about any of this. It's not worth it. Wherever there could be an argument about where I was, if we can't substantiate it with an airline ticket or Comcar records or something like that, just strike it off.'"</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So here is a minister who voluntarily says to his staff, `Go through my records and make sure that any claims that have been made are totally in order and, where there are any doubts, strike it off.' That is the difference between the standards that are applied by this government and the standards that were applied by those opposite when they were in government. When there was any doubt, their ministers hung on for dear life, hoping that they would never be found out. So we had the situation with the Lawrence affair where they hung on and hung on, to your detriment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7047"><TITLE>Travel Allowances</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want everyone in the Senate to try to recall where they were on 26 December last year, 1996. I will declare my interests: I was at the cricket for the first day of the Melbourne test. Mr Peter McGauran was staying at his family home in Melbourne and claimed travel allowance for Boxing Day&mdash;$320. Where was he? Was he at the cricket? Did he go to the sales? What public duty did he perform that day to claim travel allowance on Boxing Day, one day after Christmas? One wonders. This is the same Mr McGauran whom the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tabled a statement from in the House of Representatives yesterday. Mr McGauran made the following claim, which I will share with the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each and every claim is accurate and verifiable and paid correctly in accordance with the guidelines. My records are complete in this regard. I did not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wrongly claim, I was not wrongly paid and I exercised my own judgment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thirty hours ago he said that. Just an hour ago he came into the House of Representatives, having been challenged three times only in the House of Representatives this afternoon to justify travel allowance. He was able to proudly boast that our first query that he had claimed travel allowance and was in Melbourne on the said night was wrong. But the problem was, the other records show that he had a charter flight on 15 March, and the total cost was $1,042. Yet he was in Melbourne. So who was on the charter flight? Three state National Party MPs. He had to cancel at the last moment, so the plane took them off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what? The bill came in. The Commonwealth paid. In case anyone does not know, it does not get paid automatically. That bill is always sent to a minister and the minister must certify they have met all the conditions. I have to tell you, one of the conditions is that you have got to be on board the plane. Still, the McGauran empire tonight is $1,042 worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, with respect to the other two questions he was asked, he did take the next two flights, but he has had to come into the House of Representatives tonight and say, `I'm sorry, I was not in Melbourne that night and I was not in Canberra that night, and the taxpayers can have another $465 back.' This is a very numerate person, as we know. Guess what, even when he paid all the money back previously, he paid $100 too much for the nights that he wiped out. So he can't even add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When did all this start? If you go back through the historical records relating to Mr McGauran, he was a shadow minister then a minister. We find that, for the financial year 1993&hyphen;94, Mr McGauran claimed 138 nights in all&mdash;not exceptional&mdash;but he claimed 41 nights in Melbourne at a cost of $7,790. This becomes a bit like cocaine addiction, as you will find. By 1994&hyphen;95, he claimed 140 nights, but look at the Melbourne nights. He is up to 68 nights in Melbourne as a shadow minister, staying at the family owned residence, and charging the taxpayers $12,920. But, you have guessed it, next year, he got a bit greedier. He 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7048"> claimed only 114 nights overall. That was modest. But, guess what? Seventy&hyphen;five of those nights were spent in Melbourne, at $320 a night, staying at the family owned residence, costing the taxpayer $14,250.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 11 March he was sworn in as a minister, and then he really got his hand in the honey jar. From March 1996 to March 1997, he claimed 213 nights travel allowance. I can just think of one of my ex&hyphen;colleagues rolling over in his bed at the moment in absolute envy at this. He managed to claim 108 nights in Melbourne, at the higher ministerial rate, for a total of $34,560. That is for living at home at his residence in East Melbourne. What do his colleagues think of this? What does Senator Alston, who does a more important job than he does, think of a colleague who, if you take tax into account, is getting an increase in income of $70,000 a year over and above Senator Alston? What we have over a four&hyphen;year pattern is 292 nights claimed in Melbourne at a cost of $69,520, tax free, to Mr McGauran.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or wherever else. That is simply unbelievable. If we were having a travel allowance Olympics&mdash;we have got a lot of competitors in it at the moment&mdash;certainly he would not have won the decathlon. One of my ex&hyphen;colleagues would have won that. But Mr McGauran would have won the marathon for the consistent stamina of claiming $69,000. And he would have broken the two&hyphen;hour barrier while he was at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, if you look at the period from March 1996 to March 1997, you find that he claimed 20 Saturday and Sunday nights. Incidentally, seven of them were when his favourite football side was playing home games. He claimed $6,400 for Saturday and Sunday nights at home, watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamish Macbeth</EMPHASIS>, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you get on to this? Why did I not think of this as minister? Go and look at my travel allowance claims. I will do a Gary Hart. The most was $27,000 a year, I think, in the Gulf War year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just gargantuan. Have a look at that March to March figure and see how it is broken down. The very hardworking Mr McGauran manages to claim 108 nights in Melbourne, 83 nights in Canberra, 21 nights elsewhere around Australia and 22 nights overseas. I tell you what: that farm in rural Gippsland does not see him too often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when all of this was published&mdash;and he took all this money because he thought it would never be published&mdash;what does he do? He says in his statement that he asked his member of staff to go through randomly and knock out travel allowance claims. There is no randomness about it. He knocks out from 24, 25 and 26 March. He then knocks out about 19, 20 or 25 days in April 1997, another 14 or so days out of May and three spouse $10 ones. So there is nothing random. He really said, `Knock out every date that I have claimed from 24 March right through to 25 May.' I think 25 May was just about the time these claims were published in the parliament. Then he does not claim for June at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were any of these adjustments recorded by Mr Jull and put in the figures like they were for other ex-ministers? No, they were not. Nothing was said. It is another cover&hyphen;up. The figure is $9,200, and I have to say that he is entitled to $100 back because he could not add up. Now he has gone for another $465 travel allowance, and then he is going to go for the $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, and he may not be aware, that we have all the lists of his charter from March 1996 through to December 1996. Mr McGauran's charter&mdash;this is not VIP; this is not Comcar; this is not air fare&mdash;comes to $39,179. There is the list. Look at the number of trips he did. This entitlement is for ministerial stuff, but some of the trips are only a 10-minute flight around his electorate. He uses the same firm every time. If he wants a plane from Canberra to home, he gets it to come up from Bairnsdale, then he takes it back home. All the charges are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he is going to have to do now is reconcile all of his travel allowance claims with the list of all the trips that we have. We have speared him three times, and we have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7049"> got him three times. If we get in nine questions at question time in the Reps next week, we have two days worth of questions on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is out defending him? Is the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister now out defending Mr McGauran? No, he is not. He is out sleazing around the galleries saying, `Hold on, Mr Sutherland is not telling the truth. I don't ever recall him briefing me. I don't care what the Prime Minister said in the parliament.' He is now putting the spin on that Mr Sutherland is basically lying. He has not told the truth and never briefed him back in May. So McGauran has been cut loose by the chief political adviser. He is out trying to save himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point should be made that Mr Jull and Mr Sharp were sacked for not telling the Prime Minister. Mr Morris is not sacked for not telling the Prime Minister. You have to  ask yourself why, or what Mr Morris knows
