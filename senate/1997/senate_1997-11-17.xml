<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was debated in relation to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I think it was indicated on the last occasion that the objectives of the tribunal are the same in this legislation as they are in the primary act. It was not satisfactorily explained to me why it is necessary to restate the objectives in this act rather than just say, `Appeal is available to the tribunal', and allow the objectives to stand as they presently exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the one concern that could arise from the way that this is being done is that there could be a difficulty in the future if the Social Security Appeals Tribunal objectives are changed and the objectives separately stated in this piece of legislation remain as the originals were. The minister might indicate to me the reasons for the way this was done, whether this could be a problem, and how it could be dealt with if the objectives of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are altered in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister in the chamber will recall that there was a bit of confusion about this. We supported a number of Labor amendments which were to do with penalties. They were penalties which converted prison sentences to 30 penalty points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments extend that whole principle into another series of more serious offences. I think Labor was probably not going to support these. Nevertheless, I think it is worth putting on the record the reasons we have proposed them.     Firstly, consistency. We believe that prison sentences are not appropriate in any of these issues. Even though these are more serious offences&mdash;we recognise that&mdash;and to do with the disclosure of information, we believe that the 120 penalty points or penalty units are a sufficient deterrent and a sufficient penalty. They represent very substantial fines rather than prison sentences. If it were possible to get Labor to support them, then of course I would encourage them to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, even though these are of a different nature from the amendments which were carried previously, nevertheless, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same principle applies that prison sentences should not be applied to this legislation; it is appropriate to have a quite serious deterrent in terms of 120 penalty units. I think this is what they are called. I am sorry, I have not got the whole thing in front of me. Because of consistency and because we believe that prison sentences are quite inappropriate in terms of this legislation, we do not agree with the argument that the prison sentences are consistent with prison sentences for social security breaches. We believe that, in those cases also, prison sentences should not apply; that there is sufficient penalty in the 120 penalty units.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley, I do not know whether it is really appropriate, not being the minister, but I would like to clarify your amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give you an example. The problem, again, is that it is the very general nature of the legislation. It appears to us that it would not only be public servants: there could be disclosure of information inadvertently through a child&hyphen;care centre itself or even through parents who had access to such information. We do not want to have the possibility of prison sentences in those cases.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would have to be intentional if it were taken to court; if it was unintentional, obviously there would be no attempt to bring such person to court. The government is opposing the amendment because there is considerable community concern about the security of information that is provided by people in good faith to governments. There have been enough examples of confidential information being disclosed, and in some cases sold, to support such concerns. I am sure all of us are aware of that occurring in the past. We are a little surprised the Democrats would want to lessen the deterrents for such behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal, does this refer to six hours per week or per day? It does not specify in the amendment, because that obviously will affect costing. I can give an estimate on the assumption that it is the first six hours per week. The cost is about $35 million per annum. It would also complicate administration significantly to have different funding rates according to the number of hours each individual child uses each week, given that this number will often vary from week to week. The rate of child&hyphen;care assistance proposed is less for school&hyphen;age children than for younger children, because the cost of caring for these children is less than for younger children. State governments specify staffing ratios for children of various ages, and fewer staff are required to care for the school&hyphen;aged children.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 3A of the bill provides for the secretary to make a higher or lower rate. I understand that that has allowed some provision for a higher rate, though a fairly limited one. My argument is that it is my intention that it should be more difficult to take a higher rate. Fourteen per cent is the rate designated for overpayments and recovery in nearly all social security legislation. That should be the appropriate rate here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some serious problems with the minister's argument that, if a person has obtained child&hyphen;care assistance and wishes to repay more quickly, somehow this bill would be a bar to that occurring. This particular section only relates to deductions from the child&hyphen;care assistance entitlement of a parent prior to the payment made. It does not affect in any way the choice of a parent who, having received their child&hyphen;care assistance&mdash;although normally it would go to the child&hyphen;care centre&mdash;goes to the office and says, `I would like to pay off a bit extra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this bill or in the amendment that precludes that from happening. It restricts the amount actually taken out of the person's child&hyphen;care assistance payment to get back moneys overpaid to 14 per cent. It is not a very sound argument for the minister to say that it prevents that occurring. It would be unfair to put a person in a situation where child&hyphen;care assistance is potentially reduced to nil because of an overpayment that may well have been inadvertent on the part of that person, so that for some period of time they cannot afford child care at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could cause fairly massive disruptions to their work. Imagine that someone is overpaid $5 for a year, and they are told that they have to pay it back at 100 per cent rate. It may mean that for that particular week they cannot afford child care at all. That is not an unrealistic situation for many people on low incomes. What do they do with their children? Do they give up work for a week or for a few weeks? I do not think it is appropriate for overpayments in child&hyphen;care assistance to be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of legislation which we are debating now, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  and related bills, has far&hyphen;reaching implications for the Public Service and for all Australians who depend on government services. It has far&hyphen;reaching implications, too, for the parliamentary service and for the institution of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has repeatedly assured us that what it is about is simplifying the 1922 Public Service Act. The opposition does not challenge the need for simplification. In fact, we were the first to recognise it by instituting, when in government, a process to reform the act. But we do question the way in which the government is going about simplification. Furthermore, we question whether simplification is the government's principal motivation in bringing forward this legislation because what we have in these bills under the guise of simplification is, in fact, radical change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Senate to consider the impact and significance of these changes. For example, the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads without reference, if they so choose, to the Remuneration Tribunal. Agency heads, in turn, will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary and conditions for agency employees. They will have the power to revoke and amend determinations which give effect to conditions of service which have been negotiated and agreed between the government and APS employees. SES officers, the entire management corps of the Public Service, will have negligible protection 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against capricious or unfair dismissal. A vast range of responsibilities will be devolved to agency heads, resulting in increased differentiation, competition and rivalry between departments, and much duplication of administrative procedures. The APS will become less of a career service and there will be a loss of institutional memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all of the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. In its place the government has reluctantly agreed to the continuation of the office of Merit Protection Commissioner, but it refuses to give the commissioner the necessary independence and powers to carry out the external review function. Mobility rights, such as those of APS employees who are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, will be removed after a three&hyphen;year transitional period, thus limiting the movement of staff between the Public Service and Parliament House and the benefit to both institutions which would have flowed from that movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall effect of these and other changes introduced by these bills will be to create a more compliant Public Service which is more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. This is not the sort of Public Service which will best serve the Australian people. It is not the sort of Public Service the opposition wants to inherit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition suspects that the government's principal motivation for this legislation is its deep&hyphen;seated antipathy towards the Public Service, its suspicion and mistrust of the Public Service and its frustration that public servants see themselves not only as servants of the government but also as servants of the public. This suspicion is confirmed by other actions which this government is taking, such as cutting 30,000 jobs from the Public Service and abdicating to the private sector its responsibility for the delivery of services to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge there are some positive aspects to these bills. We welcome the inclusion of Public Service values in legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8835"> and a code of conduct for APS employees. But while the government claims to be ensuring the preservation of the traditional ethos and values of an apolitical and nonpartisan APS by incorporating these values in legislation, it is, in fact, ensuring their destruction through the inclusion of other provisions which are incompatible with, and positively hostile to, these same values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it is true, as the government claims, that the legislation proscribes patronage and favouritism. But it is also true that patronage and favouritism will be encouraged in an environment where agency heads are completely beholden to ministers, not only for their continuing employment but for their salary and conditions of employment as well, where departmental employees are similarly beholden to their agency heads and where the government remains determined to restrict the appeal rights of public servants. I think it is fair to say that, if the government wished to undermine the traditional values and ethos of the Australian Public Service, it could hardly have come up with a more effective blueprint to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills also need to be assessed in the context of the challenges Australia is currently facing: persistent unemployment, lack of job security, and lack of confidence by industry and small business. At a time when unity of purpose and interdepartmental cooperation are needed more than ever, it is foolish in the extreme to risk undermining the cohesion and professionalism of the Public Service. By weakening the ties that bind the Public Service&mdash;such as standard classifications, conditions and rates of pay, and mobility between departments&mdash;and accentuating division and competition, the government is engineering the demise of the strong, unified, apolitical Public Service that has served Australia so well for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a high risk that departments will become personal fiefdoms headed by secretaries hired more for their loyalty to the minister or the government of the day than their professional qualifications and dedication to public service. Within departments, personal loyalties are also likely to become the most significant determinants of advancement. Put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply: this is a pro-boss anti-worker piece of legislation. Its underlying philosophy is: `all power to agency heads'. They can hire and fire at will, and name their own price. The government's proposals for agency based workplace agreements will undermine the collective bargaining capacity of public servants. This will particularly disadvantage workers in the smaller agencies and those agencies singled out for higher efficiency dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further irony of the provisions contained in this legislation is that, while the government might be simplifying the Public Service Act, in the process they are hugely complicating the Public Service itself. They are sowing the seeds of a complex and confusing mix of regulations, directions and instructions that will vary from department to department. They are creating a two-tier service of executive agencies and core departments, multiple fiefdoms headed by powerful agency heads and a resultant confusing mishmash of pay scales and workplace conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation, as I have indicated, will also remove the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act by making mobility rights purely discretionary after a three-year transitional period. Right of re&hyphen;entry to the Public Service is a condition of employment of many public servants in other forms of public employment. It would have been a vital factor in the decision of these public servants to take up their current positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mobility is also the mechanism which has been used to encourage public servants to take up positions in ministerial offices. I believe that governments have very significantly benefited from that practice. The government is now proposing to remove this condition of employment. Instead, it will become something that can be granted or denied at the whim of an agency head. This is unacceptable. The opposition will be moving an amendment to preserve the mobility rights of public servants who currently have them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, what the public wants from the Public Service is the provision of policy and administrative support for the government of the day and the delivery of taxpayer funded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8836"> services in the most efficient and effective way possible. The Australian Public Service has a proud record in this regard. It is a record the opposition believes should be maintained and built on. This legislation ignores this record and threatens to undermine it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the concept of separate legislation for the parliamentary departments, recognising the independence of the institution of the parliament. We will be supporting the proposal that the clerks be appointed for a 10-year non-renewable term. We believe this will provide an appropriate and sufficient safeguard for their independence. We will be seeking to amend the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997  consistent with our approach on the  Public Service Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say in conclusion that the bills which are before us are not acceptable to the opposition in their current form. We be seeking to amend them to remedy the defects that we have identified. If we are unsuccessful in achieving substantial change to the bills, we will oppose them. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to an extract from an excellent article on the government's legislation which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 7 November. The article is by Judith Brett of La Trobe University and states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will lose the next election, and one of the reasons will be its "reforms" to the Public Service. What this Government has forgotten is that it is only one arm of government, and if it severely mutilates its other arm it exposes itself to increased risks of public policy and administrative bungles. The aged-care disaster is one example and there are no doubt more disasters waiting in the wings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can assure senators that, while the opposition certainly do not wish to prevent a coalition loss at the next election, we do wish to prevent any more such disasters being inflicted on the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R361">Parliamentary Service (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF>  are the legislative outcome of the government's agenda to substantially restructure the public sector of this country. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think `restructure' should read `gut'. The bills follow on from the discussion paper issued by Minister Reith entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS> . At the outset, I must indicate my concern with the agenda being followed by this government. The question must be asked: what do you mean by best practice? In so many areas of public policy, this government, and also the Keating government for that matter, referred to the concept of international competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the face of it, this concept has some merits. It may be considered to be a laudable aim for Australian industry or for some sectors of Australian industry, but in the context of this bill relating to the Australian Public Service, is it appropriate as a main aim? I wonder about the emphasis on increasing productivity when in fact what we should read for that is job shedding. In an area which is largely service oriented, we know what that means. But in any industry, if you are referring to this as an industry&mdash;and I would argue that it is not particularly appropriate&mdash;there are other factors. You could look at whether or not you are using your other forms of production, such as land and capital, effectively and efficiently. If you are shedding more and more jobs, I would argue that you are not necessarily using your other factors effectively and that you may be leaving people without effective access to services that they should be entitled to receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you peel away the layers of government rhetoric, it is obvious that, in many cases, international competitiveness or best practice is equated with lower wages and conditions for workers and lower standards in areas such as environmental protection, occupational health and safety and food hygiene. Quite frankly, we are seeing more and more examples of very high wages paid to people at the top in order to achieve fewer jobs and lower conditions for those people who are actually doing the jobs, particularly those people who have years of experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always wonder about the concept of putting people out of the Public Service and having to re&hyphen;hire them as consultants at four, five or 10 times the hourly rate. How many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8837"> full time people who are actually professionally involved in that level of public service could be kept on instead of having to hire consultants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU's submission to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into this package of bills pointed to some areas of concern in relation to both the rights of Public Service employees and also the broader issue of the impact of the proposed changes on public policy in this country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up some of those issues as they are consistent with the sorts of concerns that I have been raising in this place over the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue I want to touch on is the important question of corporate memory. Many of the changes in these bills, particularly those that will create massive turnover in SES positions, will destroy the concept of career public service and consequently threaten the maintenance of corporate memory that is invaluable in avoiding many of the unintended consequences and inconsistencies that are of real concern in the development of public policy. The reality is that many of these concepts that are developed into public policy have been around in some form or other for many years. There are parallels with previous policies that can be used to avoid confusion and inconsistency in the formation and implementation of policy changes. We have the serious risk of the Public Service reinventing the same wheels again and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a time and efficiency issue in the context of corporate memory. In many cases, there is no need to reinvent this wheel in relation to the development of public policy. Public servants who have been involved in the development of a wide range of public policy are able to bring that experience to the table when new public policy initiatives are being developed. People who are parachuted into senior positions on the basis of experience in the private sector, and more than likely have a sympathy for the government's policy position, are unable to bring that experience into the policy development process and consequently may find themselves reinventing many wheels unnecessarily. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you do need to have that professionalism and the ability to speak and give accurate and unbiased advice in relation to these issues. Otherwise, governments who organise a situation where they are not going to hear that critique will find themselves lurching from crisis to crisis. We already know that this government is organising it so that funding to community groups in many different sectors has a caveat, and that caveat is that they do not fund people to criticise the government. What an amazing issue in 1997&mdash;a government that does not actually want to have feedback on their own policy areas from those people who know most about what the impacts of those policies will be. Any smart government would welcome that feedback because, if they are prepared to make changes and improvements, they are likely to have good policy outcomes. This government has indicated that they are not willing to do this. Therefore it is even more critical that you have an independence and professionalism within the Public Service. That point seems to have been lost on this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue on which I have spoken regularly is job security. In the name of promoting employment growth, this government has proposed changes such as reduced access to unfair dismissal protections for small business employees. The Greens (WA) justifiably oppose that change vigorously. It is outrageous to suggest that massive job insecurity will benefit the economy and promote growth in employment. I contend that the reduction in consumer spending that will result from the job insecurity and, also for that matter, from the creation of a growing number of part-time and casual jobs will lead to, and indeed has already led to, a substantial threat to small business in this country. You only have to walk through the major shopping centres in suburbs throughout Australia to see the number of closing down sales and shops for lease to confirm this fact. In the Public Service we will see job insecurity as a result of these bills where previously there was a level of security and a sense of a career and commitment to public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are about reducing the size of the public sector and facilitating the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8838"> politicisation of the Public Service. They are consistent with the government's agenda to reduce the level of services provided by the public sector because of a blind faith that the private sector can do the job better. We will see the creation of large, inefficient private sector service providers at the expense of the public sector. How many times already during this Senate estimates process and the last couple have we actually seen that tenders have gone out or that tenders have not gone out at all? People have actually been employed as consultants with no tendering process&mdash;no publicly reviewable tendering process. This is happening again and again. So we have this double whammy of privatisation and lack of public information and public accountability.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will see the creation of a large inefficient private sector. We could instead have seen a positive approach to restructuring the public sector that avoided some of the inefficiencies that have been evident in some areas. I must say, however, that if the example of the outsourcing of senators' and members' travel services is anything to go by, we must have serious concerns about the questioning of outsourcing and the government's handling of it. Just to give you a question on that example: what has been saved? Do we end up with a more efficient or effective service? Just 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a small example. If that is what happening on a mass scale I have deep concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recently released report on information technology outsourcing by the finance and public administration committee also highlighted some concerns in this regard. We have enforced competitive neutrality in lots of areas. In relation to information technology, we have the concept of a privacy subsidy: that is, the community is required to give up its privacy to reduce the costs of compliance to industry. That is a disgusting kind of concept, and of course you end up with a lack of accountability for those people who are required to provide those services. This is not the way to go&mdash;not in 1997. If&mdash;and I have said this again and again&mdash;it is a decision of parliament to privatise more&mdash;and that is if&mdash;there should always be more accountability from the private sector to the public purse, not less. That should always be the rule of thumb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing, however, is the move towards industry self regulation and that includes those elements of industry which are in fact tendering for government contracts. That is not what we should be seeing. I will be looking to support amendments in this bill which withdraw the worst aspects of what we are being presented with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this cognate debate briefly to speak about the Public Service bills that are before us and the report that came down from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is no doubt that the Australian Public Service is different from any private enterprise instrumentality and, therefore, one cannot adopt the same for the Public Service as one would for the private sector. One cannot apply the same criteria because the nature of the Public Service is inherently different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The driving force undoubtedly in the private sector is profit. Whilst profit is achieved by efficiency, the Australian Public Service, which has to be efficient, nonetheless cannot be totally dependent upon efficiency and profitability as its driving mechanism. The same efficiency cannot apply in the public sector as it applies in private enterprise. Profit cannot be the sole determinant in the way that the public sector is run. It is interesting to look at the report of the JCPA because at paragraph 2.20 this fact is clearly recognised. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an American academic in debating how far public employment should differ from private employment:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">To many, especially those familiar with private sector personnel administration, it is difficult to understand why public sector employees should be treated any differently from private sector employees . . . the answer is simple. It is because their employers are governmental entities.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That really gets to the essence of these bills. There is a substantive difference between the private sector and the public sector, and these bills seek to dismantle any delineation. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also heard concerns that the drive to incorporate private sector management practices and philosophies into the public sector does not recognise the special qualities of people who are motivated by a commitment to public service over and above private profit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That does stand the public sector quite distinctly and separately from the private sector. The public sector is different. The people in the public sector are different. Of course, the people have a commitment which goes over and above what might be expected in the private sector. The public sector itself is there to serve the public, and I do not believe that these bills will achieve this goal. I believe that these bills will go down the path of dismantling the concept of service to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8841"> public in the name of economic efficiency and economic expediency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at paragraph 2.12 of the report, one sees the nature of the Public Service is different and the essence that the Public Service is a source of independent advice to the parliament. The independence of the Public Service is the very hallmark, the very essence, of what makes the Public Service what it is&mdash;that is, able to give valuable information to the parliament without any fear and without any retribution. Mr Harry Evans gave evidence before the JCPA and paragraph 2.12 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Evans contends that the employment regime proposed in the Bill will make it difficult for public servants to fulfil this responsibility and that Members of Parliament are increasingly likely to be confronted with ministers and their (dismissible) employees `all singing the same well&hyphen;orchestrated song'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It will be an unfortunate consequence of these pieces of legislation that we will see the valuable source of independent advice to the parliament being watered down and people being forced down the path of singing the same well&hyphen;orchestrated song, as outlined in the evidence by Mr Harry Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Public Service must be independent but still must remain of government. I feel that these pieces of legislation are forcing the Public Service to be independent and not of government. They will destroy the Public Service as a career service and they get to the very issue that confronts the people in the Public Service&mdash;that is, job security. Job security remains the No. 1 issue at the forefront of people's minds, and one cannot doubt that these bills will do much to undermine the job security which has been for so long a feature of the Public Service, and thereby the strength of the Public Service itself will be weakened. If one looks at the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Dr Kemp, at page 9775 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, one sees that he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to provide the foundation for a high performance public service while reaffirming its sense of public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not believe that these bills will do anything for high performance, nor will they do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anything to reaffirm its sense of public purpose. So, at the end of the day, the bills will be well misplaced in their purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public servants have always given their utmost in their performance to ensure that the government is given good and timely advice. The details outlined in these bills will do everything to take away the performance that is required of our public servants to enable us to have an efficient and effective Public Service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, my question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, I refer to the government's proposed therapeutic groups premiums policy which will come into effect from 1 February next year. Minister, can you tell us how many Australians are currently being treated with therapeutic drugs which will fall into the government's proposed five groups? Is it true that there are at least 1&half; million such persons who will come within those five groups? And, Minister, what will be the impact on these people, and how many of them will be exempted?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8841" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I thank Senator Forshaw for the question. There is considerable debate about the therapeutic groups changes. The government does not believe that anybody will be unfairly penalised, particularly the elderly, by the therapeutic groups premiums policy. Naturally, the elderly are the main users of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and, as I have mentioned many times in this Senate, two&hyphen;thirds of the health care dollar is spent on people over the age of 65. But they are also the people who will benefit most if the scheme is more cost effective and we are able to afford important new medicines as they emerge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumers should be asking why companies are charging more for similar drugs. We are talking about drugs which have not been shown to be clinically different when companies provide evidence to have them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8842"> considered for listing on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is only sustainable if people take cost into account where this is appropriate. For several years there has been a cost signal between alternative brands of the same product. From 1 February 1998, this is being extended to very similar drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in reply to Senator Forshaw, what we are saying is that there are a number of choices and we will fund a set price for the alternatives. It is a choice for the doctor and the patient to decide if they want to choose a more expensive version. Our research suggests that, when a doctor and a patient do decide that a drug above the base should be used, the average premium is likely to be under $2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no detail in relation to the numbers that are likely to be affected that Senator Forshaw has asked about; I need to get further advice on that. I think that those numbers may be available from surveys only. Because this is a new scheme I doubt that they will be totally available, so it will be a presumption as to what those figures might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that those products are more expensive is that companies want to charge more for their particular versions. The marketplace will quickly decide if an extra company charge is acceptable. Many countries use similar pricing arrangements and find that companies have to drop their prices because the real value is quickly decided by the marketplace. It is because of that as well that those figures will have to be regarded as an assumption. Who knows what will occur after the changes come into place. The manufacturers, of course, dislike this course&mdash;</PARA>

We have said to manufacturers, `If you can provide evidence of extra benefit, the government is willing to pay more.' Now they can't ask much more than that of the government. This can occur at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time the government will protect those people who must stay on particular medication for clinical reasons through the authority prescription arrangements&mdash;that is, if a doctor for a particular reason believes that there is a necessity for a particular patient to stay on a particular drug as against an alternative, then an approach can be made to the department for that to be considered in that context.

Minister, I might say I am surprised that you are unable to provide any estimate of numbers, given that this measure is actually intended to be a budget savings measure on the PBS scheme.

Secondly, many of the 1.8 million Australians who have chosen to become shareholders are small and first&hyphen;time investors. A good start for them to get into the share market and to invest for their futures. Thirdly, 81 per cent of Telstra shares will remain in Australian hands.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is abundantly clear to the Australian public that the central tenet of the Workplace Relations Act is to ensure that workers are able to negotiate directly with their employers unimpeded by the unwanted interference of the Industrial Relations Commission and the trade union movement. Indeed, I think the benefits of enterprise bargaining are now increasingly recognised worldwide. Certainly, the flexibility that flows from those sorts of arrangements is of enormous benefit to companies wishing to increase productivity, to workers seeking to get a greater return on their efforts, and to the overall competitiveness of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the Hawke and Keating governments recognised that enterprise bargaining was the key to a more flexible industrial relations system. So it is quite ironic that old Labor's new hero, Mr Tony Blair, stated in March this year that `the essential elements of the conservative trade union legislation of the 1980s will remain. There will be no return to secondary action, flying pickets, strikes without ballots, the closed shop and the rest.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is tired old Labor in this country advocating?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that side, yes. You couldn't get a job over here if you belonged to it. The fact is that something like 31 per cent of the work force are represented by the trade union movement overall. That is largely because of the high level of membership in the public sector. In the private sector it is about 24 per cent. What that tells you is that people are deserting the trade union movement in droves. Yet what Labor is proposing to do is to turn its back on enterprise bargaining, to go back to the bad old days of union thuggery by way of secondary boycotts, getting rid of the rights of workers to reach an agreement without a trade union being involved. They want to abolish the Employment Advocate; they want to give the IRC virtually unfettered and untrammelled power, the power to deal with any industrial matter, and to go back to industry&hyphen;wide agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process, it is absolutely vital that our industry remains competitive. We are fortunate in that we are blessed with good resources and also with the most efficient and competent mining engineers in the world&mdash;something of which we should be very proud.

There is a major increase in technology exports, in particular in the field of energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You referred to the greenhouse matter which is worth touching on. We have a reputation around the world for being one of the most energy efficient countries and we have expertise in clean coal technology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees also referred to the fact that these industries had changed from being labour intensive industries to capital intensive industries. It is a bit like Rip Van Winkle: that has been the case for 25 or 30 years. It is not a new thing. With increased competition, which is already here and has been here for the last couple of years, for these companies to remain competitive in order to maintain high exports, they must also become more productive. To some degree, you are seeing that sort of movement now in some of the mining operations.

<ANSWER PAGE="8850" SPEAKER="Minchin, Sen Nick" NAMEID="JX4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crane for his question. I did hear Gareth Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, on radio this morning talking about the importance of regional Australia. We are very pleased on this side that the ALP has rediscovered the importance of regional Australia, but we do say to the ALP that the most important thing for regional Australia is the passage of the amendments to the Native Title Act. There is nothing more important than fixing up the Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  is essential because it does remedy the fundamental deficiencies in the Native Title Act&mdash;many of which have been recognised by the ALP and we are pleased about that. One of the great deficiencies in the Native Title Act as it currently stands is that there is no basis for legally certain, binding, voluntary agreements, which obviously are essential if we are to have practical coexistence on pastoral lease land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act passed by the Labor government sets up a completely unworkable process. In Western Australia&mdash;Senator Crane's state&mdash;1,910 mining and exploration leases have been subject to the full right to negotiate process and only 148 have actually got through the process. The clearance rate for mining and exploration leases subject to the right to negotiate is only 7.7 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act has simply not delivered for Aboriginal Australians. We now have over 660 native title claims in the process that have been registered. They cover about 45 per cent of the Australian mainland. There has been only one determination of native title on the Australian mainland. So the act simply has not delivered. If the ALP talked to Aboriginal people on the ground, they would discover that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision has now more than doubled the area of Australia subject to native title&mdash;it is now 79 per cent. So all the problems with the Native Title Act are much more acute than was the case. We have multiple overlapping claims all around Australia which are dividing Aboriginal communities themselves and, frankly, raising unrealistic expectations of what native title might actually deliver. If the ALP would spend some time on the ground in the Western Australian goldfields and talk to Aborigines in the Western Australian goldfields, they would see what an absolute mess there is and what internal strife is being caused by a maze of overlapping multiple claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the country, the act is impeding state and territory management of land as well as pastoral lease land and is causing significant problems for local government&mdash;something which I think the ALP is also failing to realise. In relation to local government, as Senator Crane would well know, the people of Karratha are really suffering from the blockage in the system in relation to native title claims because housing land availability is causing enormous problems there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining and exploration industries are facing very real difficulties with uncertainty about the validity of their mining and exploration titles. We heard from the Democrats just then about the drop in employment in one of the most essential industries in this country, the mining industry, which clearly is related to native title problems. Since the Wik decision, pastoralists across the country have been completely unsure of what their rights are, not because of the Wik decision itself but because of the operation of the current Native Title Act and the great uncertainty which it is causing for people across the country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8851">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is very important because it does a number of essential things: it gives effect to the Wik decision, something that the ALP is not acknowledging; it reflects the common law finding that native title is extinguished on grants of exclusive possession; it provides legal certainty for agreements about native title; it maintains the statutory right to negotiate on land which has never been alienated; and, on pastoral lease land, it guarantees equal rights for lessees and for native title holders&mdash;what could be fairer than that? I say to the ALP: if you really care about regional Australia, you will pass this bill.</PARA></ANSWER>

Minister, I noted your comments that only 148 mining applications have gone through the process and that, out of well over 600 native title claims, only one has been determined on the mainland under the current Native Title Act or `Keating's big bungle'. How does the bill's approach to the fundamental issue of validation differ from that of the current act?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Point one of the 10-point plan is about validation. The current Native Title Act validated absolutely everything that had occurred prior to 1994 that might have been invalid due to native title. So, under the current act, validated pastoral leases completely extinguish native title, which is one of the ironies of the current situation. The only legislative extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases that may have occurred in this country is as a result of the former Labor government's Native Title Act. Graham Richardson has revealed that he, as a cabinet minister, thought that the act extinguished native title on all pastoral leases right across Australia&mdash;a bill that they all voted for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bill provides a much more limited validation regime for acts on pastoral lease land between the commencement of the Native Title Act and the Wik decision. Native title will not necessarily be extinguished by this validation, unlike under the current act. This is further reflection of the fact that we are respecting and reflecting the Wik decision in our bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked by Senators Forshaw and Neal today, relating to Therapeutic Group Premium strategy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was illustrative of Minister Herron's total lack of knowledge of what is happening in the portfolio he represents in this chamber on behalf of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that he said that he could not be expected to know the answer to my reference to the estimates last week because he was not there. As you will recall, Madam Deputy President, on Friday last week when therapeutic group premiums were dealt with in the Senate estimates, Senator Herron was sitting at the table. At one point there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8858"> was even a reference made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  to the fact that the minister was there and might like to comment. Unfortunately, he did not respond at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen today, once again, is a total failure by this minister to address some very real and serious issues with respect to this government's policy on health. If they have a disaster on their hands in terms of their policy on nursing homes, which is now in tatters, then it appears, unfortunately for the people of Australia, that a disaster is looming with respect to this policy on therapeutic group premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister cannot tell us how many people will be affected. That is a terrible admission for him to have to make because this is a budget measure. It is going to produce substantial savings, according to the government, in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is going to be implemented by regulation changes which are not disallowable and the minister, Mr Wooldridge, is actually quite proud of that. He has stood up publicly and said he can do this notwithstanding what the views of the parliament might be, nor the fact that reputable bodies like the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have estimated that around a million and a half to two million people could be affected by these changes. This minister cannot give us any information at all. One wonders how they base their calculations in the budget if they do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more important, however, is that they should know because this policy is going to come into effect from 1 February next year. From 1 February, many patients who happen to be on drug treatments for such complaints as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol&mdash;the five groups that are involved in this proposal&mdash;may well find themselves in a position where the drug that they have been taking for some time is in the higher priced category and it will no longer be subsidised under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This government, notwithstanding the fact that this policy is to come into effect from 1 February next year, still has not finalised the prices to be charged for those drugs. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given at the estimates hearing that they are still in the processes of sorting that out. They said to us at estimates last Friday that some time in December they are going to start a publicity campaign, and they are going to contact doctors and give them the information about this new scheme to come in on 1 February. As you yourself said, Madam President, and I well recall your comments, `They are going to do this during the silly season.' A euphemism of course for the fact that many people are going to be on holidays over the Christmas&hyphen;New Year period. Indeed, many doctors could well be on holidays, and traditionally have locums in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this period the doctors are supposed to consult with their patients who are on these drugs and work out whether it is appropriate for them to be transferred to the cheaper drug within the group or whether they should be required to stay on the brand name that they are on. The doctor then has to write a letter to the Health Insurance Commission seeking an exemption. All of this is going to have to be done between some time in December&mdash;we still do not know what date&mdash;and 1 February. The minister cannot tell us, but certainly the experts are saying that there could well be up to two million in this country who will be affected by these changes on 1 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we got? We have a minister who cannot give us an answer. The people who are suffering these complaints, the medical profession and the manufacturers are entitled to know what is in store.

It was dredged through and the answers were given. The reality is that the government cannot keep adding new drugs to the PBS unless it generates some offsetting in savings, and that is exactly what the previous government initiated. It will mean at the end of the day that consumers will continue to have access to the broadest possible range of the latest and most effective medicines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What disturbs me is the fact that those opposite just continually come in here or go to estimates and become abusive in the extreme about the way in which they handle these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am a little concerned about the debate degenerating into personal abuse rather than the issue. I will certainly contain myself to the extent that I am dealing with the matter in principle and not the personalities involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that for many years when I have had occasion to visit overseas I have had the opportunity of making a comparison between what the position is in Australia and what it is overseas. I was often distressed to see that, even though there were drugs available that were effective in dealing with fairly mundane, run of the mill diseases, people were often dying for lack of things such as antibiotics and quite basic pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making that comparison I often thought to myself how lucky we were in Australia that people could still afford to have the safest and most effective drug, despite the fact that they may not be particularly well off, they may be elderly, frail or poor. In Australia we made a decision that it was our priority to provide the safest and most effective drug. I suppose that is what worries me about this whole proposition, this new drugs tax, the therapeutic groups premium: we are now saying to people that you can no longer have the safest and most effective drug. If you want the safest and most effective drug in every case, then you are going to have to pay extra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had some discussion earlier about how much extra. The figure that is being proposed by the opposition is not some figure that has been plucked out of the air. The figure of $30 was put to us by people who I would have thought would well know, that is, the AMA, a group that represents the vast majority of medical practitioners in Australia. It is not some scare technique, some figure used to frighten people. The figure was put to us by people who deal with the prescribing of drugs all the time and, I believe, are very likely to be correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the problem that this is not a very good policy decision, an unfair policy decision, but also the problem that this government is making the situation even worse by not telling people what is about to occur. They have not told the pharmacists, the medical providers or the community at large. They have not told about a quarter of people who receive prescriptions. In many cases the way they deal with their prescription will fundamentally change as of 1 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little astonished, as was Senator Forshaw, by Senator Herron's statement when he said that he would not know about this because he was not there. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows that during the questioning in estimates on this issue Senator Herron was the minister who attended. During questioning on the issue, the members of the department who did provide the information&mdash;Senator Heron did not answer the questions; he was obviously concentrating on something else&mdash;said that the advisory committee that had recently 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8861"> started meeting would not be providing information before December. It was not clear whether it would be beginning of December or the end of December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the very firm view, and I believe a lot of people in the community would have the firm view, that to make such a fundamental change to the way the pharmaceutical benefits scheme operates and not provide any information some 60 days before the scheme is to take effect is really quite extraordinary. I suppose what is even more extraordinary is that members of the government who are responsible for this scheme, this major change, do not seem to be the least concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the drugs that people will have to make use of under this new scheme are not the most effective. They are not the drugs that have the least potential side effects. It has very much been the policy under the pharmaceutical benefit scheme since 1993 that a drug can only have a higher fee attached to it if it is shown to have some greater beneficial effect&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that all of us here have motorcars and we all go down to the petrol station to fill them up with petrol. One of the remarkable things about cars and petrol is that it does not matter if you fill it up with Shell, Ampol or BP, the car still runs in exactly the same way. The common ingredient in all those brands is the petrol, the gasoline. What we are talking about here with the therapeutic groups premium is exactly the same thing in principle. Therapeutic goods, or drugs, all contain a chemical. The chemical, like petrol, comes under different names because different companies market that chemical and call it something else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a difference between super and ordinary petrol, Senator Forshaw, in that it has a higher octane level. You pay a premium for higher octane just as you do if you buy a drug like an ace inhibitor, for example, or one of the other anti-depressants on this list which has a higher dosage. If you buy a higher dosage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> petrol, you pay more for it. If you buy a higher dosage drug, you pay more for it. The point is the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, you are buying a chemical and the drug companies are asking you to pay a premium for the name of the company. The argument of the drug companies is that the extra price premium covers the cost of basic research into these medications, but the truth is that very little, if any, basic research into the production of pharmaceuticals is done in Australia. Most of it is done overseas in Europe and North America. These drug companies are large multinational corporations who have vast incomes and who are just putting a price premium on their drugs in Australia in order to generate a little bit of extra income without really having any rationale for doing it. If these companies actually did research in Australia, that would be a different matter, but it does not happen that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, essentially all drugs contain the same chemical, and it is quite reasonable for the government to say that the price for a unit of some particular chemical should be the same regardless of the brand name. The government in fact expects that significant savings of some $560 million will be generated by this measure over four years. This will be of great benefit to the Australian health system because it will mean that more money will be available for other purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles has made the point that similar pricing arrangements are available or are in place in several overseas countries such as New Zealand, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. One of the important things to understand is that this new pricing policy does not mean that the entry of new drugs onto the market will be restricted. In fact, there will be no change at all and Australia will still benefit from new drugs as they are developed around the world. It does not mean any reduction in the investment by drug companies because drug companies make investments for a wide variety of reasons, and I am quite sure that the international drug companies that operate in Australia will continue to do so under this policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8862">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has introduced the therapeutic group premium strategy to help put the brakes on the runaway cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In 1996-97, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme cost taxpayers about $2.5 billion, which is $1 billion more than it cost four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I come back to Senator Neal's remarks and assure her that the Australian public will still have access to safe, effective drugs. There will be no danger to the public, and Australia will continue to have one of the best subsidised pharmaceutical benefits schemes in the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take note of the answer given about the therapeutic group premium strategy. This scheme appears to be nothing more than a money saving exercise. Again, the pensioners and low income groups will be hardest hit. Under this scheme, the government will only pay for the cheapest drugs in the group. The government's own advice on this matter is that within the groups some drugs are safer and more effective than others. Does this mean that only those who are more financially secure will have access to the safer, more effective drugs within their given group? Mr Rod Unsworth, the Chairman of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said in a statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure due to come into effect in February hits the aged, the chronically ill and the poor particularly hard by stripping away part of the PBS subsidy for many medicines. This is another swipe at the elderly. The federal government has obviously been poorly advised about the consequences of this policy. It has chosen to ignore submissions by doctors and patient groups and eminent clinicians who have condemned the policy as likely to result in health and financial problems for many patients, including the elderly . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From that quote, I would suggest that maybe there should have been more consultation with the groups of doctors and pharmacists who are the people responsible for helping to implement this policy. Further, the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Peter Joseph, warned of potential medical problems and increased costs due to this measure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other problems that have been identified in similar reforms in other countries include confusion about new medications and non-compliance with therapy. The findings of the international reference pricing study, for example, that was provided by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association to the government would appear to have been ignored. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the AMA are examples of bodies that are concerned that individual needs are being ignored, and they are also concerned by the lack of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on scientific evidence, some medications are superior to others. Some medications possess benefits beyond the original purpose for which they were first prescribed. Such benefits could be lost under the scheme to those individuals who cannot afford the additional costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a study done in New Hampshire in the United States which says that restrictions on the number of drugs prescribed for patients treated for schizophrenia reduce drug volumes by 35 per cent but increase admissions to nursing homes by more than 50 per cent. The additional costs for hospitalisation, emergency mental health care and additional clinic visits are roughly nine times the saving from volume control on drugs. So it sounds to me as though this measure in the short term will save money, but perhaps in the long term will increase costs in other areas. It seems to me that that is very short&hyphen;sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other concerns I have is that, during the nursing home debate, we had people who were potential clients of nursing homes phone our office to see whether, if they paid to go into nursing homes, they would have the same food as people who did not pay to go into nursing homes. Again, that was setting up a distinction between the elderly themselves. I am afraid that this measure may well do the same thing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the wider public's concern about their perceived deprivation of access to drugs, and I understand that the opposition is peddling a policy of fear among the elderly in particular. The elderly, of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8863"> course, are the most vulnerable in our society, apart from the very young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not the government's intention to deny access of therapeutic group drugs to the elderly&mdash;or to anyone else for that matter; it was about getting the best value for the taxpayer's dollar. Senator Denman said that money saving is the exercise. It cannot be denied that money saving is part of the exercise, but it is not the exercise. The exercise is to deliver a cost&hyphen;effective therapeutic drug group to as many people as practicable for the cheapest possible price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that most of the drugs that are dispensed within the Commonwealth come, significantly, from Switzerland, the United Kingdom or North America, and very few find their origins of ownership in Australia. I think that shielding people from information about health costs&mdash;or any other costs, for that matter, that the government is associated with&mdash;is wrong, and it is not the government's intention to hide behind that shield. This is an up&hyphen;front process and a process that rightly ought to be debated&mdash;and debated it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, for instance, the then member for Dobell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government, and I, of course, agree with that statement. If a particular drug from a family should be prescribed, it is often cheaper than a brand name drug and is equally as good in its effect as the brand name drug. It was the aim of the government to significantly target that area for money savings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy President. Further, for most people a switch from one or other to a group will make no difference whatsoever to the

If they are using a higher priced drug within one of the six therapeutic groups, they should&mdash;as I am advised&mdash;ask their doctor if they can change to what has been called the benchmark priced drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims that introducing the therapeutic group will result in costs to patients of up to $18 or more each month are entirely misplaced and misleading, and add to the scare tactics that the opposition, I am rather ashamed to say, has resorted to&mdash;and not just with this particular subject either. The premiums are not simply a subtraction of the price of the cheapest drug dosage from that of the most expensive in the therapeutic group; the premiums are calculated as the average cost of the drug across all dosage forms. This smooths out peaks and troughs of individual prices, and TGPs are only expected to be around $2. The average brand premium under the minimum pricing policy is about $1.70.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entry of new drugs into the market will not be restricted. Since 1996, 134 new products have been listed. Most are currently under consideration, and prices of innovative drugs listed in recent years in Australia are close to average European Union prices. There will be no deleterious effect of the government's initiative of introducing the therapeutic group premium scheme.</PARA>

These reforms are clearly based on Government's policies on Competition, Regulatory Rationalisation, and reform of Government's role in industry operations.

The Commonwealth held discussions with the industry and reached an agreement to implement arrangements which will ensure that the effect of the safety net on the manufacturers of the different tobacco products is as close as possible to effect of the business franchise fees which applied prior to the High Court decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although Senator Campbell quite rightly says that supposedly there was a vote on that, I was still trying to find it on my desk.

It was not something that had actually been brought up at a meeting, and I thought there would actually be somebody checking with the office. I had no idea we would actually be voting on the issue today; I thought that if we were going to do it there might be some notice of motion and that we would vote on it at another time. In the end, what happened was that Senator Campbell said only that he moved `the motion as circulated', so we did not actually hear in the chamber what we were being asked to agree to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Just to respond to Senator Brown's questions, as I always do&mdash;I think Senator Brown and Senator Margetts would attest&mdash;I did circulate this information and phone your office as quickly as I could. I realise that if you are in other places and it is hard for people to get to you then the message will not get through. But the minute we seek to do something as far as managing times is concerned, we ring all senators, including Senator Carr as the Manager of Opposition Business&mdash;and the leader, where required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, we ring Senator Brown's office, your office, Senator Harradine's office, Senator Colston's&mdash;when he was here&mdash;and the Democrats' offices. I was aware that my office, as soon as these decisions had been made&mdash;and they are only government decisions; we come here to seek agreement to do them&mdash;we advise your office. I know that your office was rung within about 30 seconds of the decision being made, because we rang you first to give you that information. The reason we rang you first is that most of the other senators were probably more closely aware, because the discussions between chairmen of the estimates committees and deputy chairmen took place as those estimates were unrolling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you correctly assumed, Senator Brown and Senator Margetts, we had put the Friday in as a scheduled spill&hyphen;over day so that committees were scheduled to sit on the Wednesday and Thursday last week and to have a scheduled spill&hyphen;over day on the Friday. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We thought we had scheduled enough time with those three days to achieve estimates&mdash;and with most of the committees we got there. There is only one committee that needs a serious amount of time, and then two other committees need more time. But we had always agreed informally&mdash;and I stress informally&mdash;that if there was going to be more time required then we would substitute a sitting day, that, is Thursday, for the extra time for estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for the reasons that Senator Brown has articulated, was always reluctant to lose that Thursday because we needed as many hours as possible this week to ensure that our legislative program, pre the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , is dealt with this week so that we can make a clean start on native title and have two entire weeks dedicated to debate starting on 24 November. The opposition have suggested a way around trying to make up some of the time we will lose on Thursday and that suggestion is contained in the motion we have passed; that is, that tomorrow and Wednesday, instead of having government documents, the Senate will sit, doing government business, through until 8 p.m. each evening. We will pick up two and a bit hours doing that and will only lose about half an hour of government business because of the decision to do estimates on Thursday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate formally that the government seeks to commence the native title legislation debate as soon as possible. If we get through this week's program today, we will start native title tomorrow. If we get through it tomorrow, we will start native title on Wednesday. We will start the native title debate as soon as the legislation on the agenda for this week is finalised. They are all bills which we must have before Christmas, as was explained at the leaders and whips meetings last week. It is our intention to have them dealt with this week. It will require the cooperation of all senators when it comes to dealing with the legislation through the committee stage. I seek the cooperation of all senators to get this week's program done this week so that we can start native title when we come back next Monday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to put on the record the concerns that the Australian Democrats have about this particular incident, which is reported on by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security at the Adelaide office of the National Crime Authority in 1994</EMPHASIS> . One of the most serious attacks on a law enforcement agency in this nation's history occurred in our home state of South Australia, Madam Acting Deputy President, on 2 March 1994. The bombing killed Geoffrey Bowen and maimed Peter Wallis. May I extend the sympathies of the Senate and my party to Peter Wallis and both of their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that this happened more than three years ago, there has been no successful prosecution of this crime and many questions remain unanswered. This is not good enough from the perspective of our law enforcement agencies. It is the role of the parliament and our responsibility to make sure we get to the bottom of this particular incident. In a significant piece of journalism by Jamie Walker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 October this year, it was noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to the impression senior police and NCA figures sought to convey, the security infrastructure at the Adelaide office was grossly inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article also reported that specific purpose built electronic monitors to vet incoming mail were not installed, despite repeated recommendations, because of the cost. The hand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8877"> held scanners&mdash;they are of the type used in airport security and are designed to detect guns rather than bombs&mdash;apparently were the only scanning devices used in the South Australian office. If this is the case, it is contemptible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report before us sets out a very serious admission by the National Crime Authority, and a matter that must be taken seriously by the parliament. This report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Committee is reporting to the Parliament its concern about the failure of the NCA to provide it with a fully reliable explanation of the state of security prior to the bombing.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is also a matter of concern that the revised advice was only prompted by revelations in the media, which suggests that there are recording or reporting problems in the NCA's Adelaide office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that security has since been beefed up on NCA recommendations. I understand all mail is now X-rayed and other measures are in place to protect these agencies from harm. If this is not the case, something must be done to bring these protective measures up to standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Democrats have now raised these concerns on a number of occasions. We believe that those people who are in positions of authority and who are charged with the responsibility of protecting others are entitled to the maximum level of physical security available. The lives of those in public service are valuable&mdash;like all other lives&mdash;and we must learn the lessons of this particular tragedy to make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps equally concerning is the spectre of what other information provided to the committee has perhaps been omitted or coloured. This experience is unacceptable, and the committee is well placed to get some overdue answers. I would hope the committee will reassess the information which has been provided to it to make sure it has all the available material to make its assessments according to its terms of reference and the duties of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter this report raises concerns the coroner's inquest. After three years, the South Australian coroner's office has not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> convened an inquest into this tragedy, because the police investigation has not been finalised. I understand this is standard practice in my home state of South Australia. However, given the lack of prosecution after this time&mdash;and it is over three years ago&mdash;we should be seeking answers as to why the coroner's inquest has not started. This investigation is central to resolving this tragedy and learning the lessons so that this never happens again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to a constructive resolution to the committee's investigation into the details of the NCA's potential misleading of the committee, as well as a determination of the other material provided to the committee upon which assessments have perhaps been wrongly made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Audit report No. 13 of 1997&hyphen;98 is a very disappointing report by the Auditor-General. The Commonwealth received its final instalment receipt on Friday, the final $6 of its $10.45 sale price set in July 1996, yet as at Friday the Commonwealth Bank shares were trading at $17.20 per share. If as at Friday when the Commonwealth received its final instalment on the bank shares the new shareholders had paid market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8878"> value, the Commonwealth today would be $2.8 billion better off. To put it more simply: the Commonwealth Bank was sold for $2.8 billion less than it was worth, which means that 17 million taxpayers in Australia are worse off and 354,000 shareholders will be better off to the tune of $2.8 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank was a case of bad timing, and this audit report concedes that point. A few months before the float, Commonwealth Bank shares were trading at 16 per cent higher than they were when the float occurred; six months later they were trading about 40 per cent higher; and now they are over 60 per cent higher. But when the float occurred it was a time of market uncertainty and, instead of pulling the float, the government proceeded and all of us have been left worse off by several billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Auditor&hyphen;General, the government achieved its twin objectives, which are described as, firstly, having achieved an optimum financial return from the sale, with appropriately balanced regard for the interests of the Commonwealth, CBA and present and future CBA shareholders; and, secondly, encouraging an orderly after&hyphen;market share for CBA shares. The object of the orderly after market was to keep investor appetite high for future floats. It is a pity that the Auditor&hyphen;General did not comment on the appropriateness of those objectives, I would have said, because the Democrats disagree with them vehemently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, the sale of a public asset should have one objective and one objective only; that is, to ensure that the taxpayer gets full value for the loss of public ownership in the asset. Interests of future shareholders or floats should be disregarded. If we are talking public assets, then the public interest should be paramount. It was clear that this was not the case in the Commonwealth Bank float.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit report shows that, notwithstanding the poor market conditions in July 1996, the share price could have been pushed up from $10.45 to $11 and still have been fully subscribed. This would have resulted in an extra $244 million to taxpayers. But the government did not do that and, as a result, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $244 million was given away, in effect, and this has since ballooned out to $2.8 billion. The Commonwealth Bank sale was a fiscal disaster for which the financial advisers received almost $70 million&mdash;$70 million for selling an asset for $2.8 billion less than it was worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of the Commonwealth Bank sale was to transfer $2.8 billion in windfall gains from public assets to private purses. It followed the undervaluation of the CSL float and the Qantas sale, and today it has been followed by a $2.6 billion undervaluation of the Telstra share price. It shows that privatisation is very much about benefiting the few at the expense of the majority of Australian taxpayers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previously in this debate I raised the issue of the statement made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in the other House. The minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to provide the foundation for a high performance public service while reaffirming its sense of public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I question what is high performance. I really wonder whether it is economic efficiency or the provision of service that the minister was referring to. For if it is economic efficiency rather than the provision of service, we have a situation where public servants will be placed in a high performance based environment which will have little or no regard for the public needs and, of course, will then place at jeopardy the job security of the public servants as they strive for high performance rather than address, primarily, the needs of the public. I believe this is one of the hidden areas of these public service bills; that is, rather than service to the public being the maxim, we will see high performance and, of course, the public will be the only ones to suffer under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a few other issues that I will raise, and they came out in the hearings that took place before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The first one is the issue of the independence of the Public Service. I believe this has to be retained at all costs, such that there is not an erosion of the quality of advice that the government receives. For if we see a situation&mdash;as I believe will evolve as result of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8880"> this bill&mdash;that the quality of advice is eroded because the public servants feel at threat in their jobs, then we will see a reduction in the independence of the Public Service, and we will see a diminution of a service that has long served this nation. These bills, unfortunately, do not guarantee this independence. I think this needs to be addressed as we proceed through the stages of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that concerns me is the loss of the continuity of corporate knowledge by striving for the flexible employment arrangements as envisaged by the bills. The word `flexible' has many connotations. Invariably, my experience of the word `flexible' has been one more threatening rather than consoling&mdash;`flexible' implying lack of security, lack of tenure and lack of any commitment on the part of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that happens, we will end up with a loss of the continuity of the corporate knowledge&mdash;a vast corporate knowledge&mdash;which rests with the public servants who are currently employed. If flexibility becomes the main thrust and driving force behind the Public Service, then we will see people being chopped and changed at the whim of those in power and we will see as a result the loss of the corporate knowledge of the organisation. That can work only to the disadvantage of the public who are served by the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service as an organisation is a seemingly endless repository of knowledge. One cannot expect, with changing personalities within the Public Service and under a flexible arrangement, to have this repository of knowledge retained. We will eventually see the wheel being reinvented every time a situation arises. This is no good for the public and this is no good for the overall efficiency of government and the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA report recognises the need to maintain a degree of stability and the continuity of corporate knowledge. I trust that, in spite of the claims of the government, this can be reinforced and cemented in place to take away the uncertainty that exists with the legislation as I believe it currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I want to briefly refer to is the transparency of employment actions. If 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one looks at page 113 of the JCPA report, one finds recommendation 14, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service Regulations dealing with review of Australian Public Service employment actions must be redrafted, in a way which is, at least, simple, clear and concise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that recommendation does not go far enough because it is not just a matter of being simple, clear and concise; it must also be fair and independent, for not to do so will sacrifice transparency. This government says it is about transparency. Here is its opportunity to see that transparency prevails. What we have at stake in this situation is really the credibility of the Public Service. So it is not just a matter of redrafting the employment actions to be simple, clear and concise; they must also be redrafted to be at least fair and independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that I want to speak about briefly is remuneration for agency heads. Whilst the JCPA and, I believe, the government have agreed that the remuneration for agency heads should still be published in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies as envisaged in the recommendation of the JCPA, I believe that the remuneration also needs to be left with the Remuneration Tribunal because there we have a clear and transparent operation, an operation that is subject to public scrutiny and public purview&mdash;the very essence of what these bills should be about. So in my view the government really do need to have the remuneration of agency heads not placed elsewhere other than with the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills the government is pursuing will see, in my estimation, a loss of tenure and job security and a lowering of morale. In my summation, the bills in effect attempt to make the Australian Public Service a compliant and subservient organisation rather than a vibrant and responsible organisation. I understand that the government says that it does not want it to be politicised, but all I can see coming out of these bills is a politicised Public Service, which I do not think will serve any government of whatever persuasion any good in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there is some agreement that the previous act was in need of review, I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8881"> believe that this review will do anything other than strive for efficiency and lose sight of the fact that the Public Service really should be service orientated and serve the public in a proper and meaningful way. I believe these bills as summed up in part of the report will shun the qualities of people who choose the Public Service as a career. This is the thing that stands the Public Service aside from any other type of business or organisation throughout this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many senses, these bills do nothing to enhance the Public Service but merely seek to detract from a very credible organisation that has served Australians, the Australian government and the Australian people well over a long time. Whilst the government claims good intent, I believe that most of the good intentions will be misplaced when this legislation finally passes through this chamber unless it is appropriately amended.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate to start my remarks today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R361">Parliamentary Service (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF>  by acknowledging the fact that the Australian Public Service is a great institution and one that has served Australia very well since the beginnings of federal government in this country. The men and women of the Australian Public Service should be proud to be playing a crucial and integral role in our system of democratic government, a role which they perform admirably, even in the most trying of times. A fact that is often overlooked is that the Australian Public Service is not some cumbersome dinosaur that some on the other side of the chamber would try to have us believe; it is a dynamic and efficient organisation which has served successive governments very well. It is an organisation that has shown a willingness to change and evolve as the country it serves has changed and evolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has more than fulfilled its essential functions of providing fearless and frank advice to government, delivering services to the wider Australian community and ensuring efficient government administration. These 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> functions have been, and are still, so very important to the development of this nation. They go to the heart of what assists a nation to be a community, to be a civilisation; they go to the heart of accountable and responsible government. The reason Australia enjoys such a professional Public Service is because of the high calibre of those men and women who make a commitment to that service. It is a commitment that I feel is undervalued by the community and completely disregarded by the Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a complex and important package of bills that the Senate has before it. In fact, the importance may not be fully realised at the moment by the Australian community. These bills have far&hyphen;reaching implications obviously and immediately for members of the Australian Public Service but they also have implications for all Australians, particularly those in our community who depend on the services that the government provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that these bills and the ideology behind them highlight the dramatic difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor firmly believes that strong and active government leadership with a strong public sector operating in partnership with a thriving private sector best ensures the delivery of both security and opportunity for Australians. Labor believes that government is critical in the achievement of social justice. We see government as a guardian of the common good, not only in achieving social justice but also in securing many public benefits which are unlikely to be delivered by a free market. It is this commitment to good government and an understanding of the important role that government has to play in our society which distinguishes Labor from our opponents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of my constituents, I approach this package of public and parliamentary service bills with great scepticism. It is with very good reason that we approach these bills this way. The people of Canberra and Australia have been betrayed by this government time after time after time since the coalition was elected last year. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave his word to the people of Canberra. He even put his promises in writing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8882"> in full&hyphen;page ads in the local paper, stating that he would not cut more than 2,500 Public Service positions in his first term as Prime Minister, stating that he would not change the Public Service superannuation scheme and making a whole range of what are now obviously not core promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen happen? We have seen Mr Howard and his slash and burn team sack over 30,000 public servants in under 18 months, over 10,000 of which are here in our local community. We have seen him change the superannuation arrangements for public servants that will see the benefits they receive dramatically reduced. We have seen him show complete contempt for the national capital by not residing in the Prime Minister's official residence, the Lodge. Now this mean spirited and divisive government is lining the Australian Public Service up for its final blow, a plan that will cause instability and derision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think that this government has given all Australians very good reason for being suspicious of the changes that they propose, especially with respect to the Public Service. The government's main argument for the proposed changes contained in these bills is one of simplification. Yet it is most ironic that, while these bills may simplify the Public Service Act, they will complicate the Public Service in the process. These bills are setting up a very complex and confusing mix of regulations, directions and instructions that will vary from department to department. The legislation will create a two&hyphen;tier service of executive agencies and core departments. It will create multiple fiefdoms headed by powerful agency heads. This bill, at its core, is against the interests of the employees of the Australian Public Service in its underlying philosophy of all power to agency heads. Agency heads will be given the power to hire and fire at will. Agency heads will be naming their price, a price that will see them become political servants rather than servants of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most frightening thing about this legislation, and the thing which indicated the government's real intentions, was the original proposal to delete the 75-year-old requirement for the Public Service to provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate advice to the government of the day. This government espouses all these statements on old values and principles, yet there was a period where they were prepared to place under threat the tradition of Commonwealth public servant giving frank, honest and accurate advice without fear or favour. This, the most important of principles, goes to the very fabric of the Australian democratic system, a principle more important today than ever before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter aside, the overall effect of these and other changes introduced in these bills, despite all the government's assurances and declared intentions, is to create the potential for a Public Service which will be more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. While this government may think that is a positive, it is only a short&hyphen;term positive for them, because it is the Australian community and our democratic system which will suffer if the Australian Public Service is simply reduced to a party political extension of the executive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also crucial that the Australian Public Service maintains reasonable working conditions so that it continues to attract competent people. I understand that reasonable employment conditions is a concept that is lost on this government. But by diminishing the conditions in the APS you simply diminish the calibre of people wanting to serve their community through the Australian Public Service. It would be most terrible to see an institution such as the Australian Public Service&mdash;an institution that has produced such great careers&mdash;simply reduced to a mediocre or average government administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in recent times the skill and the talent by which the Australian Public Service has positioned itself in a global context on best practice in a whole range of administrative areas. The late Nugget Coombs and the other great architects of Australia's post&hyphen;war reconstruction under the Chifley Labor government are a wonderful testament to the benefits of governments valuing a well resourced and independent public sector&mdash;values that this coalition government obvious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8883"> ly does not share with the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also been most enthusiastic in its use of the word `flexibility' when talking about the changes required to the Public Service. However, we see that the proposed employment provisions under these bills would restrict mobility between the Australian Public Service and the staff of members and senators, government authorities and business enterprises. What absolute hypocrisy by this government to talk about the essential need for flexibility and at the same time remove a provision in the current act that gives total flexibility in the management of the human resources of the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the situation with respect to how these bills propose to change the way the Merit Protection and Review Agency operates. Of utmost importance is ensuring the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, but further to that is ensuring that the commissioner's statutory functions are included in the primary legislation, and that the commissioner has the power to properly carry out the duties and responsibilities that are required of the MPRA&mdash;something the government has failed to provide for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also changes the way in which the MPRA will report. It will no longer directly report to the parliament but to the Public Service Commission. Perhaps the government should listen to its own members on this point. Mr Georgiou, a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which considered the bill in detail, stated in his speech on the bill in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other side of the coin to flexibility is accountability. For this to be met, the independent review body will have to be very robust in reporting to the parliament on cases where secretaries choose not to implement its recommendations. This is of great significance and I do expect that the parliament will be monitoring such reports very closely to see that what is intended does actually occur.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Georgiou has got it right. It is a pity that the government, of which he is a member, is unable to get it right. Without these powers the Merit Protection Agency simply becomes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> window dressing; something that appears to be one of the government's goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the point of the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 , the opposition supports the concept of separate legislation for the parliamentary departments. We recognise the importance of maintaining the independence of the institution of the parliament. However, we have seen from this government attempts to gut the structure of the parliamentary departments. The arguments I have applied with respect to the Public Service Bill equally apply to the Parliamentary Service Bill. The accolades I have given to those in the wider Public Service also most definitely apply to those who have made a commitment to serve the Australian people through serving their parliament and their parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has made clear by its actions towards the Public Service since being elected, that it is motivated by hate and has a small&hyphen;minded, mean&hyphen;fisted approach to government. It is the Australian people who suffer most as a result of this approach. The dismissal of public servants is not just about the loss of jobs. It is an attack on the role of government in the delivery of services to all Australians and the willingness to invest in the provision of services&mdash;a willingness that has been shown to be lacking by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, what the Australian people want from the Public Service is the delivery of taxpayer-funded services in the most efficient and effective way possible. The Australian Public Service has a distinguished record in this regard. Australia does have a Public Service of which we can be proud&mdash;one which receives criticism that it does not deserve and one which does not always get the defence it does deserve, especially with regard to this government. I greatly value the contribution of the individual Australians who choose to work for their government as public servants, and collectively for their contribution to our nation and our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to imagine what Australia is going to be like if this government is allowed to pursue its agenda. Can you imagine a country where the means by which services are provided to those in need is governed by the ability of the private sector to make a dollar 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8884"> out of the provision of such services? The concept of user pays applied to services that are currently provided by government is one that is abhorrent. I reject it on the basis that it is not about equity; it is not about fairness; it is not about giving all Australians a fair go. It is about a principle that excludes the concept of fairness. It is about a principle that blindly puts the interests of the private sector above the needs of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this package of bills is that it does not take into account the great record of our Public Service and how it increases equity in Australian society. Hence, it does not look to maintain or build upon that powerful framework upon which it was built. These bills, if not successfully amended by the opposition, will result in the undermining of much of that which has made the Australian Public Service so successful and so effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that we need an amended, more contemporary Public Service Act. However, I do not accept that these bills provide a viable option for an Australian Public Service that will be able to serve the nation as the Australian public expect and as the Australian public will continue to demand and expect into the new millennium.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Service legislation seeks to implement the government's Public Service reforms&mdash;reforms which are pitched clearly and unequivocally at undermining the integrity and independence of the Australian Public Service, reforms which attempt to turn the Australian Public Service into the creature of the government of the day rather than the servant of the government, the parliament and the Australian public. I want to be very clear about this from the outset: the Democrats are not opposed to Public Service and public sector reform. In fact, we see it as being necessary if Australia is to meet the challenges ahead with an efficient, effective and viable public sector in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government released its discussion paper on Public Service reform, the Democrats said that we welcomed reform aimed at improving service delivery and reducing bureaucratic obstacles standing in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way of the APS delivering more responsive and flexible services and programs. We indicated that we welcome reform designed to improve work practices within the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally attended Public Service focus groups run by the then minister for the Public Service, Peter Reith, and I got the sense from those sessions that many dedicated Public Service employees were looking for change. They were looking for changes designed to make the Public Service both a better work environment and to give it an improved capacity to deliver quality services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the end result of that process&mdash;this  Public Service Bill  currently before us today&mdash;has very little to do with improving quality of service. It has very little to do with freeing up the APS to deliver more responsive services and programs. It has very little to do with making a genuine attempt to build a modern Public Service and everything to do with what are mainly industrial relations reforms aimed at putting the APS well and truly under the thumb of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill passes the parliament intact, the Democrats believe it will result in a shift towards a less accountable Public Service, one over which the parliament will be unable to exercise adequate scrutiny and one in which Public Service employees will have difficulty obtaining fair access to redress for wrongful actions and decisions. It is a bill which reflects the government's failure to acknowledge that any changes or improvements in work practices should also take into account the role of the APS in serving both the public and the wider public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APS serves the government of the day. Of course it is, in practice, doing the government's bidding. Nobody pretends otherwise. But there has always been a sense of a wider public duty running alongside that role. This bill represents the Howard government's attempts to entrench in law their very limited and narrow vision of what constitutes an effective Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that the Howard government does not trust the Public Service, especially the Canberra based Public Service. Some level of mistrust is understandable when a government comes to power after a long time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8885"> in opposition. But I believe the coalition government has done both itself and the country a great disservice by elevating that mistrust to the level of paranoia, to the point where it has either not sought or has rejected good advice from departmental staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That mistrust or paranoia is partly responsible for some poor decision making and poor policy implementation from the government since its election. Instead of looking at improving its own performance in this regard, the government has opted for legislation which attempts to impose a radical reform agenda on the Australian Public Service&mdash;an agenda which will change the nature of the Public Service and turn it into, in the words of Sir Lenox Hewitt, `a series of appointments at pleasure'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our minority report to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, the Democrats set out our objectives to this bill very clearly. We summed up our position in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are concerned the Bill in its present form signals a shift away from a Westminster style public service able to give independent, frank and fearless advice to both government and parliament, towards a new `private sector' model of public service which `belongs' to the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I acknowledge that the government has taken on board many of the concerns of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and that what we have before us today is a vastly improved bill from the one introduced into the House of Representatives. But it remains a seriously flawed piece of legislation and one which the Democrats cannot support without substantial amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' outstanding concerns remain as set out in our minority report. We remain concerned about the process of appointing agency heads. We believe it is unacceptable for the Prime Minister and ministers to be able to hire and fire departmental heads, as well as fix their remuneration and conditions in a manner which is not subject to independent review or public scrutiny. We remain concerned about the inadequate protection afforded to Public Service whistleblowers. Senator Murray will speak on this particular subject and will move 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments designed to significantly increase that level of protection. We remain concerned that the bill is silent on the question of maintaining standards, accountability and quality in the APS services which are contracted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are unable to support legislation which effectively removes the right of Public Service employees to appeal to an independent body. This seems to us to be a very fundamental point of accountability, particularly when the bill imposes very few other controls over primary decision makers within the APS. We are unhappy about the exclusion of SES employees from the operation of the Workplace Relations Act. We are concerned about the capacity of these changes to result in major discrepancies across the APS in workplace conditions, terms and remuneration&mdash;a shift which is likely to lead to some agencies being able to offer higher salaries than others, irrespective of the nature, value or priority of the work being undertaken by the agency. We believe such an approach is unlikely to lead to better quality service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her evidence to the JCPA, Ms Helen Coventry of the University of Canberra made some important points about the value of some common or basic standards across the APS. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To some extent any change produces productivity losses, but the losses can be minimised . . . if there are more common features on which to build amongst the units that are being combined. In the past the mechanism which facilitated this type of change in the public sector was the common terms and conditions of employment. We did see different cultures, but at least that was a strong base on which to effect such change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, members of the APS identified with membership of the APS. There has always been a stronger sense of belonging to the Public Service than belonging to a particular agency . . . This identification can be attributed to a belief in the role of government and wanting to serve government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very crucial point which we think the bill essentially ignores. There are other aspects of the bill with which the Democrats have concerns. We intend to support those opposition amendments which address most of these concerns, but we will also be moving our own amendments which go further than the opposition's amendments in six key areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8886">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we will ensure APS values also apply to services which are contracted out and that contracted services are delivered in an effective and transparent fashion. Secondly, we will retain the Governor-General's power, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, to appoint and terminate agency heads. Thirdly, we will retain the power of the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of agency heads, the Public Service Commissioner and the Merit Protection Commissioner. Fourthly, we will move amendments preventing agency heads from entering into individual workplace agreements with APS employees. Fifthly, we will significantly enhance the protection given to APS whistleblowers. Finally, in relation to the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 , we will remove the 10-year tenure limit on the clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives and ensure a much more accountable process for the appointment of the clerks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the six features which distinguish our amendments from those of the opposition. They are matters which we believe must be included within this legislation for it to be acceptable to us. Without the inclusion of these protections, these bills remain little more than an unacceptable attack on the independence and integrity of the APS; they remain little more than an attack on the rights of APS employees. They do little to improve public service quality or efficiency and they will ultimately do very little to deliver a world&hyphen;class modern public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Bulletin of Public Administration</EMPHASIS>, Peter Hennessy, who is a Professor of History at the University of London, observed that a cornerstone of a successful public service was the giving of `fearless advice resting on top&hyphen;class analysis'. He expressed the view that, in the current climate of globalisation, `the prizes go to the flexible and the intelligent. And governments can be neither of those things if the outcome of policy making is the precooked, the palatable and the convenient'. In the Democrats' view, the Howard government has allowed its preconceptions and prejudices about the public sector to stand in the way of delivering world&hyphen;class public service reform.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Public Service Bill 1997  will ensure the government receives from the APS the advice that it wants to hear, not the advice that it needs to hear. That is an outcome which will inevitably lead to a precooked, palatable and convenient result which will do little to serve Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it has been extremely difficult to make an informed assessment about the impact of this legislation because of the absence of detail available to the parliament. The bills themselves are light on detail with much of the practical workings of the legislation coming in the form of regulations and directions from the Public Service Commissioner. Getting hold of the final versions of these directions and regulations has proved close to impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a copy of the regulations and directions, marked `draft only', and these were delivered to us last week. I understand these are the full and final set of regulations and directions which will accompany the bills. I also understand that the minister intends to table these documents today as part of the debate. Even if the minister does that, I do not believe it is acceptable for the Senate to proceed to debate these bills in the committee stage today. We have had less than one week to look at the regulations and directions, many of which are concerned with crucial parts of the principal legislation. I do not believe that that is sufficient time for the Senate to debate these bills in an informed and responsible manner. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit all words after "That", substitute:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing my remarks to these public service bills, in particular the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> , I think it is appropriate to go back to where this whole process really started&mdash;that is, a discussion paper issued in November 1996 by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith. It is interesting to note some of the comments that were made in that paper. One well worth restating is that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8887"> terms of maintaining the traditions of the Public Service. This is a quote attributed to the Prime Minister on 9 May 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian public is very fortunate that over the years it's had a federal public service that has been distinguished by two characteristics. The first of those characteristics is an extremely high degree of integrity and honesty . . . The other characteristic, of course, is a very high degree of professionalism, and a willingness over the years . . . to give comprehensive and, on most occasions, pretty zealous technical advice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is so true, and the Prime Minister endorsed a statement of the key ethical values of the APS, and it is worth noting some of those points. The discussion paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The values, which the National Commission of Audit described as `a best practice method of setting the ethical standards for the public service', are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the highest standards of probity, integrity and conduct;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> merit as the basis for achieving excellence in staffing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Also in this discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian public service</EMPHASIS>  by the Prime Minister it is worth noting some of the comments in the preface by the minister himself. The minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is looking at more effective ways of serving the Australian public. It is no longer appropriate for the APS to have a monopoly. It must prove that it can deliver government services as well as the private or non&hyphen;profit sectors. This will require a new emphasis on contestability of services, outsourcing those functions which the private or non&hyphen;profit sector can undertake better and ensuring APS commitment to the process of performance benchmarking and continuous improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APS must meet the challenges of market competition and ensure that its quality standards match those of the private sector. To do this it will need support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is very interesting. He continues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is determined to address barriers which lie in the way of the APS becoming a truly best practice organisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He forgot to mention the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">one that is able to deliver quality service to government and the Australian people and, at the same time, provide a professional and rewarding environment in which to work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister then went on to some dot points, which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve this the employment framework governing the APS needs to be modernised. This must encompass:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the legislation regulating the Service, most notably (but not exclusively) the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Service Act 1922</EMPHASIS> ;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the industrial framework and enterprise bargaining arrangements which establish APS terms and conditions of employment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the management framework which influences the culture and practice of individual APS workplaces; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the need for more effective leadership based on clear vision and communication of future directions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, in that preface statement, the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to receiving your ideas and views to assist the Government in finalising its approach to these important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together we can reshape and reinvigorate the APS&mdash;and through that process ensure that the Australian public is provided with access to better government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are some very notable points there that the minister and, indeed, the Prime Minister have made&mdash;none of which appear to be supported by any of the legislation the government has introduced. It would seem that, contrary to what was set out in this discussion paper and contrary to the paper's objectives, the government is proposing to introduce a system of favouritism&mdash;a system where the Prime Minister and ministers can employ departmental heads, negotiate their salaries directly and keep those salaries confidential from the parliament; and the departmental heads, in turn, can negotiate the salaries of officers, et cetera. The Prime Minister has said that that is how you go about providing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a very high degree of professionalism, and a willingness over the years . . . to give comprehen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8888"> sive and, on most occasions, pretty zealous technical advice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But I am not sure that will be the outcome. The Finance and Public Administration Committee conducted a round table discussion in February of this year where some very interesting comments were made. Of particular note were comments made by the Public Service Commissioner, Dr Shergold, and the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> , Mr Waterford. I would just like to quote some of the points made by Dr Shergold and Mr Waterford, and I will start with some comments made by Mr Waterford. In addressing the concerns the ACT has with regard to this government's approach to the Public Service&mdash;and I think they are genuine concerns&mdash;Mr Waterford said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to tell you that I come here as a considerable sceptic yet to be convinced that what is on offer from our new best practice Public Service is better than what we have now. I think I would almost prefer the old Public Service Act, and all of its very clear imperfections, to the brave new world in which some of the discussion paper is taking us. I say that, very well aware of the imperfections of the old act, though irritated by the misleading nature of some of the criticism of it, and thinking that there are many useful reforms of it which could be made.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is so true because, in the discussion paper and as part of the overall process, various points have been made with regard to the problems associated with the existing act. If you look at the discussion paper and at how things have proceeded, you see that some confusion has crept into this process about the competitive tendering, contracting out and outsourcing of government services versus the employment of public servants. It would appear to me that that is the case and, as I said, that comes through in the discussion paper. There is nothing wrong with this process of reform of the Public Service Act and the competitive tendering and contracting out of government services. Indeed, we started it. We have never opposed amendments to the Public Service Act to bring it into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have seen over the years, various acts or agreements relating to employment have changed to fit the need of the time, and there is nothing wrong with getting the Public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service to be more efficient and more effective. But what is proposed in this legislation is far from that. Many other speakers have highlighted the problems of having an approach whereby, as I said, the Prime Minister, ministers, et cetera can negotiate with people employment outcomes that will never be up for public scrutiny. That can create agency or departmental fiefdoms where people will be beholden to the government, and that is something I thought the government wanted to totally avoid. I thought the government was seeking to have a Public Service that would deliver independent advice, that would deliver unbiased advice&mdash;something the government has always accused the current Public Service of not doing. So, if the government is about seeking changes, it ought to have done it in a genuine way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, some areas of the existing act certainly needed looking at, and one that got thrown up quite often was how many types of leave there are. Many aspects of the existing act could have been amended to rectify all those problems&mdash;leave, payments&mdash;but, at the end of the day, it is critical that we have a Public Service that has the capacity to provide a career path and that will allow public servants to take an interest in the process. It is critical that public servants have a commitment to the Public Service. They provide a very valuable service not only to the government but also, more importantly, to the public of Australia. If we do not have those things, I think that we will be taking a major step backwards rather than any step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service bills, as has been said on a number of occasions, not only seek to create a very different and, I think, incorrect approach to the employment of public servants but also seek to get rid of a number of other things. In particular, they seek to remove the mobility rights of employees. Many governments have benefited over the years from public servants who have transferred from the service and have been directly employed by government working either for ministers or the Prime Minister. If that ability is taken away, public servants' career path development is also taken away. Also, the opportunities for public servants to increase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8889"> and expand their knowledge of the way in which government operates in various departments would be removed. At the end of the day, such an action would very much preclude and, I think, put to an end such benefits for public servants and, therefore, the service that they can provide to the parliament and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we so suspicious of this current legislation? Why should public servants be suspicious of it? That is fairly well highlighted by the fact that the government has got rid of 30,000 public servants in 20 months. Although the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) may have said that only 2,500 jobs would be lost, we have seen 30,000 go. Most of them have gone from Canberra and the Canberra region. The Canberra region has suffered and is suffering as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, although it seeks to do otherwise, this legislation lends itself to patronage and favouritism. This is a position that I suppose the government has always had, but it will increase if this legislation is enacted. We moved some 61 amendments in the House of Representatives, all of which were defeated, but that will not be the end of the day for this legislation. We must seek to amend it. As I said at the outset, there is nothing wrong with changing legislation to bring it into the 21st century, to make it more acceptable and to make the Public Service more efficient, more effective&mdash;we should do that. But that is not what the cognate bills seek to do; quite the contrary, in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage people not to support this bill. As I said, if we cannot get it amended we will see a Public Service that, firstly, will not be responsible to the parliament and, secondly, will not serve the government or the public of this country very well at all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> , I will largely devote my remarks to accountability matters with reference to the bill, but before I do so I want to make some brief remarks on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R360">Parliamentary Service Bill 1997</XREF>   and on the most important issue, from the Australian Democrats' point of view, in that parliamentary service bill, that is, the restriction which is intended on the ability of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the clerks of both houses to have complete independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institution of parliament is perverted to some extent by the dominance of the executive in the lower house. The separation of powers requires the parliament to be representative of the people as a whole. In that sense, it requires it to be distant from and distinct from the executive in as many ways as possible, particularly in areas to do with accountability and with ensuring that the executive of the day cannot interfere with the process of democracy and proper representative institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, the presence of independent clerks who can fearlessly provide advice to individual senators or members and to parties other than the party of the executive of the day should be protected to the fullest degree possible. I think that the Presiding Officers were remiss in recommending a limited tenure for the clerks; I disagree with that intention. I am glad that the Labor Party has managed to persuade the government and the Presiding Officers to consider a tenure term rather than a five&hyphen;year term, but I will regard the day on which we grant limited tenure and, therefore, limited independence to the clerks as a bad day for this parliament. I think the numbers will ensure that that is the outcome, but I want to express my great concern and that of the Australian Democrats over that erosion of independence for both the Senate and the House of Representatives as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the  Public Service Bill 1997 . The Australian public sector in the 1990s is a vital but rapidly diminishing part of government. In May 1997 the public sector accounted for under 18 per cent of the Australian work force, which is still a very substantial figure. By comparison, in June 1985 it accounted for just under 26 per cent of all employed persons in Australia. So it has had a reduction of at least one quarter. It is estimated that after the public float of Telstra the number of those employed in the public sector will drop to approximately 15 per cent. So it has been rapidly diminishing. But it is still one of the largest employers in Australia and, as such, the public sector must provide 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8890"> the best possible environment for its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic rationalists would perhaps sit up at the motion of the best possible environment for employees&mdash;because they also look at things from the point of view of employers&mdash;but it is my view that it is in the interests of both the employer and the employee to guarantee the best possible environment for employees. Overwhelmingly, research suggests that employees who are happy with the conditions of employment will be far more efficient, far more loyal, and far more productive than those who are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall the guru of downsizing who, once he had wreaked his havoc in the United States and spread it to other countries through the world, then recanted and said he was terribly sorry, because the job insecurity and the damage that had been done to employees' belief in their employers had in fact resulted in lower productivity, less efficiency and less loyalty. So you have to provide a system which keeps both employees and employers happy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the interests of the employer&mdash;in this case, the government&mdash;that the public sector provides such an environment so that the government will benefit from a productive and efficient public sector which has loyal and happy employees. The question the government has to answer is whether these bills will in fact produce that result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Public Service Bill 1997  is intended to replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service. I have had little disagreement from any party with the concept of bringing the Public Service up to modern standards, but it is essential that the new framework does not undermine the purpose, tradition and very high standard of the Public Service, which is to serve the public. It is also important that it in no way damages the essential assets of the Public Service, which are the skills, loyalty and dedication of the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of those members of parliament who have lived in a number of countries, and I can tell you that the Australian Public Service is of a standard and ability which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many other countries would really like to have. It is not a standard which should be dropped in any way but, if it can be raised, let us see if this bill can do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 20 years the role of the public sector has been subject to vast changes. I only wish to stress that the changing demands on public servants and the changing nature of their jobs have meant that corresponding changes have had to be made to the terms and conditions afforded government employees. Job security in the Public Service is no longer guaranteed, which has been welcomed by some.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all familiar with the mythology of inefficient, parasitic Public Service employees who have no genuine interest in serving the public and who spend a large amount of their career living off the work of others and cannot be sacked because they never step out of line. I have used the term `mythology' because I do not believe that that represents the majority of public servants in any sense. My own experience of the public sector in Australia is quite the contrary, and they have a well deserved reputation as being very able.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, these bills do herald the further removal of job security in the Public Service, and that will continue to have significant negative effects. But let it not be forgotten that it was not the coalition who introduced job insecurity to the public sector; it was the Labor Party. And it is the Labor Party who must stand condemned for so much which has hurt the tradition and nature of the way in which we deal with our public sector employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of this bill that has been commented on at length is the potential loss of independent advice from senior public servants to government ministers without fear or favour. It is said that there is already a sign of deteriorating standards of advice to the government as a result of wholesale retrenchments and downsizing, because the best people have often gone first. However, that has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the view, often offered by those with relatively little experience of the private sector, that private sector standards of hiring, firing and managing are in fact better 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8891"> than those in the public sector. Many private sector organisations, including some very large ones, are in fact run on autocratic principles&mdash;they are not democratic organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People stand to lose their jobs, not just in terms of not fulfilling the productive or efficient requirements of the organisation but also if they do not fit in. And fitting in in the private sector means making sure you do not put your boss offside by giving advice or opinions which might not be relished or liked. The public sector, on the other hand, has a tradition of doing that very thing. And quite rightly so, because governments come and go, ministers and parliamentary secretaries and those sorts of people are of varying capabilities and varying abilities, and the independent advice which can be offered by a member of the public sector who does not have to fear losing their job because of providing that independent advice is in marked contrast to the tradition and nature of the private sector employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind all those who say how wonderful the private sector is that, if you look back over 20 years at the Fortune 500, you will find that two&hyphen;thirds to three&hyphen;quarters of those companies listed 20 years ago are no longer featured. One of the reasons they are no longer featured is that the nature of employment and management practices in those organisations has often not encouraged independent advice. It is not automatically so that private sector practices are necessarily preferable or better in a public sector environment with very different demands upon the people. We must be cautious of automatically trotting out that kind of prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future, advice which is not consistent with the policy of the government of the day will only be given by courageous public servants who do not fear that their job promotion or future opportunities may be on the line because of that advice. That is not a welcome development because it is preferable for large numbers of public servants to feel that way. The removal of this and many other protections in the public sector's administrative law gives more urgency for the inclusion of new protections for public servants. It is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that area that I now want to address my remarks because I wish to introduce amendments to the Public Service Bill 1997  which will focus on comprehensive protection for Australian Public Service employees who make public interest disclosures, people otherwise known, often pejoratively, as `whistleblowers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What my whistleblowing amendments will seek to achieve has been recognised as essential for the future of a democratic system of government. It has been recognised as essential in numerous Australian royal commissions, inquiries, committees and reports. It seeks to provide a legislative framework which encourages public interest disclosures about wrongdoing, corruption, fraud, gross waste or mismanagement and which affords protection legally and, in some circumstances, physically to those who make such disclosures in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An effective program to combat corruption and gross maladministration in the public sector needs two arms: one to carry the sword with which to pursue and eradicate the wrongdoing disclosed by whistleblowers, which is the role of the government's anti&hyphen;corruption forces such as the police, the Auditor&hyphen;General, the Ombudsman and anti&hyphen;corruption agencies; and the second arm is the shield with which to protect whistleblowers from the swords of those whose wrongdoings were disclosed by the whistleblowers. That is the role of whistleblower protection bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative amendments which I have had drafted for the Democrats recognise the dual needs of a whistleblower. They establish an independent agency&mdash;the public interest disclosure agency&mdash;which is given the responsibility of investigating reports and allegations of wrongdoing and establish an independent body&mdash;the whistleblowers protection agency&mdash;charged principally with the responsibility for protecting whistleblowers from reprisals. This is a conscious effort to change from the model in which responsibility for whistleblower investigation and protection is grafted on to existing agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also provides a more flexible model for disclosing information as it affords protection to whistleblowers who make public interest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8892"> disclosures to the public interest disclosure agency, the whistleblowers protection agency, an agency head or the Merit Protection Commissioner. In certain circumstances, disclosures may also be made to a member of parliament or a journalist. This picks up on the New South Wales Protected Disclosures Act 1994 which provides similar protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This protection to whistleblowers would be extended whether or not the allegations were disproved, but not if they were deliberately false or misleading. Therefore, a person making disclosures in good faith would be protected by these amendments, while a person making false and misleading claims would be criminally liable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's  Public Service Bill 1997  provides very limited scope for disclosure and protection of whistleblowers. Their protection is limited to allegations of breaches of the code of conduct contained in the bill. This is clearly inadequate as it may circumscribe the opportunity for what whistleblower legislation commonly describes as `public interest disclosures'. Frankly, we would have preferred for the government to have brought forward their own whistleblowers bill, but they have not done so. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Democrats to introduce this major accountability amendment to the only vehicle we can; that is, the Public Service Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat amendments broaden the scope of whistleblower disclosures to include violations of law, gross mismanagement, gross waste of public funds, abuse of authority, substantial and specific danger to public liability or safety, or a failure to act lawfully. This is necessary if we are to have an honest, efficient, open and accountable public sector in Australia. The amendments also protect whistleblowers from legal action should they breach any secrecy laws in making public interest disclosures that fall into these categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remedies for whistleblowers who are threatened or who have been subject to financial disadvantage through loss of job, demotion or lack of promotion are included in the amendments. Remedies include reinstatement, ex gratia payments and, where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriate, damages. The remedies would need to be enforced by the Industrial Relations Commission or the Supreme Court, and the commissioner of the public interest disclosure agency would have the power to apply to the court for orders or injunctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public interest disclosure agency would also have the power to recommend disciplinary action against government employees responsible for the harassment of or discrimination against whistleblowers. To date, for those of you who think this is academic, 12 whistleblower protection bills have been drafted in Australia and New Zealand and five have become law. Two impressive bills were tabled in the Senate in 1991 and 1993, but have got nowhere. Since then, no comprehensive legislation establishing independent agencies for the reporting of public interest disclosures and for the protection of whistleblowers has been passed by the Commonwealth. This is a sad indictment on the government as in 1994 the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing tabled one of the most important official analyses of whistleblowing in Australia. The government is yet to respond to that report three years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 and 1994, whistleblower laws were passed in South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT. A limited form of whistleblower protection is now in place in Western Australia under the act establishing the Anti&hyphen;Corruption Commission, although in Western Australia, yet again, Premier Richard Court has largely ignored the commission on government's recommendations in this regard. Whistleblowers in the remaining states, territories and the Commonwealth must rely on the common law for any form of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whistleblowing legislation is essential at the Commonwealth level for a number of reasons. Firstly, protection for public servants who make public interest disclosures encourages openness and transparency in government and is crucial if the government is to be truly accountable to the public. Secondly, whistleblowing is a legitimate form of action within a democracy. There have been, are, and will continue to be occasions when whistleblowing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8893"> is the only available avenue for the concerned ethical citizen to expose wrongdoing in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, with the passing of state legislation which protects public service employees, quite clearly the gap in the legislative program with respect to Australian public sector employees would establish unsatisfactory inconsistencies or discrepancies and would mean that the public servants at the Commonwealth level were not afforded the same level of protection and encouragement as their state counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next, the corruption scandals of the 1980s demonstrated the need for a system which provided for the reception of information about wrongdoing and the protection of those who bring disclosures forward. The Commonwealth is not immune from this and must act to protect its employees or risk public resources in an environment where public sector employees will not report corrupt activities, fraud or gross mismanagement which is costing taxpayers money because they are not afforded any protection in statute. We must afford whistleblowers protection. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to what Senator Murray had to say, as I always do. Perhaps more discussion can occur in the committee stage about his whistleblower provisions. There is another side to that. He condemns government for not bringing whistleblower provisions forward. The other side of it is that it has the capacity to develop the culture of the informer, which was the sort of thing that Sir Winston Churchill had much to say about in the 1930s. It also highlights the statement that was made in Pearse and Pearse by the Lord Chancellor of the time, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely&mdash;may be pursued too keenly&mdash;may cost too much.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any development of a whistleblower statute needs to be done very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some hesitation in saying that it should be done in the context of the  Public Service Bill 1997 , which really deals with other matters. This bill deals with the way we can best get the sorts of services we need from the public servants that look after the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proper government of this country, which is a different function from that of people in the private sector. Corporations Law, for example, says that a company's duty is to look to the welfare of its shareholders by ensuring that the profit of the company is as great as it legitimately can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the purpose of a public service is to give proper advice&mdash;and it has been said here today, and it will be said again and again&mdash;without fear or favour, and to give advice that is proper for the proper governing of the country. We do not want the situation, as was said to King Richard by John of Gaunt as long ago as that, according to Shakespeare, where `a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown'. What he was saying is what we are saying now, and what speakers before me have said today: if you do not want 1,000 flatterers giving advice, then you have to do something to ensure that they will not be flatterers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proper comparison for public servants is not to those in the private sector but to those people whom we want to make decisions without fear or favour&mdash;namely, the judges. Whether it is pursuant to the act of settlement, the precedent set by the American constitution, the Code Napoleon or our own constitution, we try to ensure two things for judges: tenure and a proper level of income&mdash;not a rich level of income, but a proper level of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular legislation that we are considering, we do not know what level of income is going to be given to public servants because that is going to be set by people other than those in parliament. It is going to be set pursuant to regulations. Certainly, there is no pretence of giving tenure to any public servant because the provisions within the two bills that we are considering at the moment&mdash;the  Public Service Bill 1997  and the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 &mdash;is to ensure that anything but security of tenure is granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our constitutional history says that the way to get good sound advice is to give tenure and a reasonable income, but those propositions are being overturned in these bills. This is radical legislation. The longer I am in this place, and the more often I see bills like this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8894"> coming before me, the more I realise how conservative I have become. The sort of radical legislation that is brought before these places and which tosses aside the great principles upon which our constitutional history has developed comes as a shock and a disappointment to me, I must confess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For example, in the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 , we have a provision that the clerk will have a 10-year period and no more. That is a coming back from the idea of tenure; the clerk is given security for 10 years but that is all. I would be very disappointed if the reason for that particular provision was that there was a dislike of a particular clerk at a particular time. If that was the motivation behind this provision, that would be a most disturbing issue. I have not heard of a good reason why it should be a 10&hyphen;year period, except to say that we need a turnover of ideas every now and then.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray says that we are here to ensure&mdash;I am not sure what he says we are here to ensure&mdash;but what I am saying is that, as governments come and go, you need a steady, reliable set of advice that is going to be given without fear or favour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to be developed through the bills before us today is the spoils system, but only more so. I think it was Thomas Jefferson who started off this system when he was President but it was brought to its zenith&mdash;if that is the right word to use&mdash;or nadir, if you look at it another way, by President Jackson in 1829 when he came in and said, `Right, from now on, the top of the public service will be appointed by the incoming administration.' That has led to the spoils system in America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this legislation goes even further because this is a spoils system directed not only at the top echelon of the Public Service but also at every public servant who is to be employed. Let us look at how that comes about. Clause 10 of the Public Service Bill  sets out high and proper values for the Commonwealth administration to pursue but then provides for a mechanism calculated to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> see the realisation of those values marred. Clause 51 of the  Public Service Bill 1997  gives the Prime Minister power to appoint a departmental secretary and clause 52 enables him or her to terminate that appointment `at any time'&mdash;that is the expression used. Clauses 20 and 22 give an agency head, which includes a departmental secretary, the right to engage public servants, and clause 29 enables him or her to dismiss them at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is entrenched in legislation that the Prime Minister can appoint and dismiss at any time the person who will appoint and dismiss those public servants that come within his or her department. That is clearly a recipe for a spoils system. It is a fundamental change in the philosophy that has served us well until now. The fact that the Public Service makes such a contribution is set out by the minister previously responsible for this particular legislation, Mr Peter Reith, in a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS>. This paper was published in November 1996 and forms the basis for the bills that we are now considering. He wrote in the preface:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APS makes a vital contribution to Australia through the advice and services which it delivers. The Government recognises and values the high ethical standards, professionalism, independence and quality of the technical policy advice it provides.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having said that, he then goes ahead and sponsors a bill which is going to mar the realisation of those qualities. He goes on to explain himself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally it demands that the APS be a modern and efficient employer which exhibits best practice, is committed to continuous improvement and exemplifies contemporary management techniques.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why does it demand that? What evidence is there that the introduction of those sorts of mechanisms will lead to a better Public Service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a statement from the minister in this discussion paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS>, saying that we have a very good Public Service and Senator Murray says that, in his experience around the world, this is an outstanding Public Service. The government says, `Yes, we have that, but we are now going to change,' because for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8895"> some reason it demands that the sorts of employment strategies that now operate within the private sector are better. Mind you, Senator Mackay and I would say that the sorts of employment laws that operate in the private sector now are just as destructive in that sector as they will be if introduced into the Public Service. Senator Mackay and I wonder when people are going to be praised for the work they do, given some sort of tenure within the job they carry out and also given fair remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997  and the  Public Service Bill 1997  are brought forward is that it is said they are going to cut away the legislation that presently surrounds the employment of public servants and people who are employed within the Senate and the House of Representatives and akin departments. Having said that it is going to put aside all that legislation, it then sets out, in various proposed sections, provisions for regulations. There are going to be regulations providing for conduct under proposed subsection 13(13) of the Public Service Bill and the Parliamentary Service Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to be able to set through regulations the sort of conduct that is to be expected. You are going to set out sanctions for APS employees and for people employed in the parliamentary service. You are going to set out provisions as to how they are going to be sanctioned in regulations. You are going to put out regulations as to how people are going to be suspended from duty. You are going to put out regulations as to what the retirement age is going to be. You are going to set out regulations for commissioners' functions. You are going to set out regulations as to how salaries are going to be treated when there is a garnishee order out. You are going to set out in regulations how the clerk is going to be suspended&mdash;and on and on it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is taking away all those things from primary legislation, which must be passed by this parliament, and putting them into subordinate legislation for some reason or other. This gives a much greater advantage to the government to put forward 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what it wants, because parliament then has to be on the lookout and has to know when these regulations are going to come along. In any event, the regulations operate until they are disallowed&mdash;if they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not so much that legislation is being stripped away from the employment of public servants; it is that that legislation is being put into a form which gives the government of the day much more control over what that legislation is going to be. It makes it a little more difficult, perhaps a great deal more difficult, for parliament to fulfil its proper role in overseeing that sort of subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a real problem here. We have the Parliamentary Service Bill which makes all of those people in the Department of the Senate, who have served us so well over the years, much more vulnerable to being fired. I just wonder why the people who serve us in this chamber, who look after us in the corridors, who look after our economics and who look after our speeches by putting them in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for 1,000 years should suddenly be put in a position where their security of employment is attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it about these people that we now think it is proper and right to make them subject to hiring and firing almost at the whim of particular individuals? True enough, there are some procedures to go through but, nevertheless, the statement that people can be fired at any time on the say&hyphen;so of particular individuals is set down in this legislation. That seems to me to be not well calculated to give us that honesty of service that we need; it is calculated more to ensure that a thousand flatterers will sit within the Crown&mdash;that being the government. It just makes you wonder about the attitude that people entertain in looking at how their fellow citizens go about their tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have a bit more to say when we come to the committee stages of this legislation, but the way to sum it up is this: this is legislation which expresses great aspirations. It sets out the qualities that we want in our public servants, in the clerks and in all of those people who help us in the Senate and the House of Representatives and elsewhere. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8896"> quite inspiring in the sorts of aspirations it sets out. But, having set them out, it then introduces a system that is quite cruelly calculated to ensure that those qualities are not forthcoming. It creates a service that is so dependent upon the will of one or two individuals that it will ensure that what we get is not the independent, courageous&mdash;it would be courageous if it were given&mdash;well&hyphen;assessed, measured advice we need. What we will get is the sort of advice that people think will best go down with those who are able to determine their future. If they do give advice that is correct in those circumstances, it is going to be courage above and beyond the call of duty.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney is always a hard act to follow and I regret to inform the chamber that my contribution will not have the same literary and historical flavour as his, and will probably be much more dry in its content. I rise to speak on the Public Service bills before the Senate. These bills have undergone scrutiny by two committees. The most comprehensive, of course, was the report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I commend the committee on its work and the report that it produced, but we on this side of the chamber believe that it goes only part of the way to meeting the concerns that many people have with these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, as my colleague Senator Faulkner has already indicated, Labor is supportive of the need to reform and simplify the present act. We believe that such an aspiration is simply axiomatic. We recognised this need and we instituted a process to reform the act when we were in government. However, from our perspective, the scope of such reform needs to be spelled out honestly and clearly to the parliament and the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Public Service Bill 1997  is yet another example in our perspective of the government essentially falling over itself to push its industrial relations agenda, which is contained in the Workplace Relations Act. We believe this has highlighted the mistrust this government has of the Public Service. I suspect, if one were to go through public comments in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> made by now government ministers, one would find that mistrust of the Public Service certainly there. Also I suspect that these bills are a fast-tracking vehicle for further downsizing of the Public Service, which has deleterious effects on not only regional economies but also services provided to the public&mdash;so it is not simply an economic consequence but also a social consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has shown that it is quite adept at window dressing its real intentions&mdash;and again I refer to the Workplace Relations Act. But I believe it is important that the government now stop what is clearly a deceptive activity and spell out very clearly its agenda to the Australian community, because I can assure the chamber that the agenda is very clear to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of the government's doublespeak is before us now. The government has stated that these bills in part are to simplify the Public Service. We regard that as a laudable aspiration. Whilst that may be the case, it should be noted that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts does not accept that all the changes would result in simplification. Recommendation 14 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Services Regulations dealing with review of Australian Public Service employment actions must be redrafted, in a way which is, at least, simple, clear and concise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not regard that as being a particularly onerous ask. For the record, we believe that the redrafted regulations need to do a lot more than that. It does not sound as if the stated objective of simplification was given that much priority by the government in drafting this legislation. I submit to the chamber that the government's proposed changes, with or without amendments, have in fact very little to do with simplification or retaining an apolitical Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my perspective, I can say to the chamber and the Australian public that the primary motivation of this government through these bills is, as Senator Cooney has referred to, widespread and radical change&mdash;not unlike what we regarded as the furphy of the alleged technical changes to the Workplace Relations Act, which gave even greater power to the Employment Advocate, powers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8897"> which we believe will further result in workers being disadvantaged. I notice a Democrat amendment has been circulated about that, and I will come to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this simplification is a confusing range of regulations that will encourage inconsistency and inequities between agencies and between Public Service employees. From the very beginning of this term this government has been attacking the Public Service. Let us look at the empirical evidence for that. We have seen 30,000 jobs cut from the Public Service, and from May 1996 to May 1997 the number of Australians in public sector employment decreased by 92,800 according to ABS statistics. These are the straight job losses; they do not take into account the multiplier effect, which has been cited in a number of reports as at least two. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regional economies the multiplier effect is higher than that. For every single public sector job you take out of a regional economy, some of the estimates that I have read say the consequence can be up to three or four. In my home of state of Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country, cutbacks in the public sector have had a devastating effect in terms of service delivery and the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further testament to what we regard as the wholesale butchery of the Public Service is the subsuming of the Department of Administrative Services into the Department of Finance and Administration, and the sackings of departmental secretaries, which we have heard about over the last 18 months. The Department of Administrative Services case was fairly interesting. I heard earlier some reference to whistleblowers. I wonder what the motivation is behind the subsuming of the Department of Administrative Services with regard to the so-called `travelgate' episode&mdash;if you cannot get the whistleblower, you abolish the department. Simply, this type of initiative cannot be tolerated. These bills will go quite a way towards endorsing the use of whistleblowers as scapegoats. This is something that we obviously do not agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deep mistrust that this government has of the Public Service is manifestly obvious. This government wants to make employees in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Public Service live in fear of losing their jobs. It wants a Public Service which is beholden to the government. It wants a Public Service, as Senator Cooney said, of 1,000&mdash;I cannot remember what he said now, but it was good&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ELLISON" NAMEID="9X5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, flatterers. From my non-literary perspective, it would be a Public Service full of yes&hyphen;people, which is the same thing. If this is not the aspiration of the government, then why attack the conditions of employment with regard to tenure of public servants? Why do that? Why give agency heads the virtually unfettered right to hire and fire? Why seek, as I understand the initial draft of the bill, to exempt dismissals from the unfair dismissal provisions if it were not to make public servants more insecure and less likely to blow the whistle, as it were, or less likely to provide courageous advice without fear or favour?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why else would the government originally want to do away with the Merit Protection Commissioner and require only the Public Service to be&mdash;and this is from the original explanatory memorandum&mdash;`responsive to the government in providing timely advice'? That is a very interesting quote. I am not quite sure what `timely advice' is. I think it is a variation on `Don't call us; we'll call you'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, prior to the JCPA's recommendation, was not interested in honest and frank advice&mdash;a longstanding principle in the Public Service; and one which has been there for decades and is evident in the best of public sectors elsewhere. This government, clearly as is evidenced by these bills, cannot come to terms with a Public Service that not only serves a government but also serves the public, as Senator Faulkner said in his original remarks. The Labor Party believes that the effect of these bills, if not amended, will create a pliable Public Service, one which may be easily moulded by the government and full of `a thousand flatterers'. By the time the government has finished downsizing the Public Service, it will probably only be 1,000 anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, whilst claiming to entrench the traditional values of the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8898"> Public Service as an apolitical and non&hyphen;partisan Public Service, is in fact attempting to do the reverse with this legislation. A number of witnesses before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts commented that, if the bill were implemented in its current form, it would undermine the values traditionally thought to be important in the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA report listed a number of the concerns of witnesses before the committee. I would like to briefly mention them. It was argued that the original bill would change the APS from a public service to a government service&mdash;a very important distinction; destroy the APS as a career service; erode the quality of advice provided to government; increase the risk that the APS would be politicised; destroy the cohesion of the APS; result in a loss of Public Service values; ignore the qualities of people who choose public service as a career&mdash;that is very important; and significantly weaken the parliament&mdash;also extremely important in terms of transparency and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principal among those expressing these types of concerns was Sir Lenox Hewitt, the former Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who has served a number of governments. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it will go right to the heart of good government. It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I interpolate `the bill'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will detract, because what has been an outstanding Public Service will not maintain the quality that it had under the conditions of service that were introduced at Federation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I congratulate the government and I am glad to hear that the government has listened to the concerns expressed by the JCPA and has adopted in whole or in part the recommendations made by that committee. I am also glad to hear that this government accepts that there are certain fundamental services which a citizen should receive, not that there are many services left with regard to the Public Service, and the list of these services is getting shorter with each parliamentary sitting as we see the subsuming of departments, the cutting of services and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the chamber believe that maintaining a career Public Service is vital to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the well-being of any government and the Australian community. We certainly concur with the arguments of Sir Lenox Hewitt who suggested in his evidence before the JCPA that this legislation in its original form would have destroyed the APS as a career service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with interest that I noted the comments of Minister Kemp in dealing with the need for secretaries to provide frank and honest advice to government. As already mentioned, the government's original proposal was only for timely advice. We have a bit of a shift there&mdash;we have moved from timely advice to frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and timely advice. It is nice to see that the change in emphasis has been made. But my concern has to do with the minister's comment in his second reading speech on the bills. Minister Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say that I have found no evidence that secretaries are less frank and fearless in their advice today . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I want to say about this is that it is impossible for the minister to make that type of personal judgment because he has no direct experience of the quality of advice he would receive under the proposed bill. Up till now, all the advice that he has received from secretaries has been under existing provisions and the existing legislation. So I think that that really is an endorsement of the APS as it currently stands rather than evidence going to the fact that the APS needs a radical overhaul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of frank, honest and accurate advice from public servants has played an important part in the traditions of the Public Service and has sent out a very clear message to Australia that candour and quality of advice that they receive from the Public Service is paramount. It is also a sad reflection of this government that they had to be more than a little reminded of the importance of this principle by the JCPA report and the witnesses who gave evidence before that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern which was also mentioned by Senator Faulkner originally is the lack of assurances given by the minister with regard to the issues of mobility of public servants between the APS and government bodies. The minister accepted the JCPA's recommendation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8899"> that a transitional period of up to three years be allowed for those public servants with current mobility rights to decide whether they wish to return to the APS or remain in their current employment. Whether the transitional period is 12 months or three years or whatever, the government's intention of allowing agency heads the discretion to determine their own arrangement as best suits their needs has the potential to limit or restrict the mobility of staff between the Public Service and governmental bodies. This mobility provision has provided many advantages, not the least being the recruitment of expertise and talent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability for staff to move between the Public Service and Parliament House, to use one example, has been of great benefit to both institutions. I do not think that anybody here would disagree with that. The security afforded to public servants by the recognition of the mobility rights provisions has been invaluable in being able to attract public servants from other areas of government. It has resulted in the type of crosspollination which adds to the Public Service and adds to the quality of advice that the Public Service provides the government and the executive. Under the bill, the ability of the parliament to attract public servants it wants is seriously curtailed to say the least, particularly when it is considered within the scope of power that agency heads may be given under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern I would like to talk about briefly is the issue of merit based selection. It is absolutely essential that merit remains a fundamental principle in the selection process. It is essential that procedures that ensure that merit is a fundamental basis of selection be enshrined and maintained in the Public Service Act. This side of the chamber welcomes the government's decision to support an independent Merit Protection Commissioner to review employment decisions as clearly a commonsense decision. A bouquet to the government for that. However, I have a number of reservations regarding this issue. Those reservations have to do with the need to ensure that the independence of the commissioner is not eroded and that the commissioner be required to report directly to parliament. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of concern about the creation of fiefdoms in the Public Service, and given the government's proposal whereby the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to set agency head terms and conditions, and agency heads will have the power to hire and fire and set terms and conditions and so on for agency employees, I believe that this concern is well and truly justified. This proposal by the government, and I quote again from the JCPA report, `constitutes significant departure from current practice.' They said it. It is significantly different from current practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is it a significant departure, but it is highly likely to promote an ethos of advancement because you are a mate, or it is highly likely to create a cultural cronyism, or it is highly likely to create a culture of `Yes' people, as we referred to before, instead of merit. This is why the Merit Protection Commissioner's role must be strengthened. The government has said that it wants to maintain the traditional ethos and values of an apolitical and non&hyphen;partisan public service. but these changes are, I believe, completely contradictory to the stated aim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal would create an environment where people are hired for their loyalty rather than commitment to public service. This proposal, I believe, would see the demise of an apolitical public service. I believe the reason behind this proposal is once again to push inter alia the government's workplace relations agenda which will see the undermining of collective agreements. We will see the push by this government to introduce Australian workplace agreements on a take it or leave it basis. I note that the Democrats have circulated an amendment which indicates that agency heads should not enter into AWAs with employees. I say to the Democrats: it is a bit late, because in fact AWAs are well and truly entrenched in the public sector, not only at the SES level but also at levels throughout the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to the chamber what is happening with regard to the creation of the new PEPE, in terms of the creation of an employment services market, to show exactly what this means; we have a situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8900"> whereby workers wishing to transfer to the PEPE will be required to sign an AWA or they will not be employed. I appreciate that the government may say, `Ah yes, but the PEPE is now an incorporated body,' but basically AWAs are already there in the Public Service. The degree of duress involved is very difficult to prove because of the lack of transparency with regard to the AWA process. Agreements will create a situation whereby employees will be potentially doing the same work but on different pay scales. We will see employees potentially working side by side with different pay scales and conditions; that is, if the AWA situation is entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even so, the provisions of this bill in terms of the current Workplace Relations Act will provide for agency heads to say to somebody in, say, my home state, `You work in the tax office in Hobart; your pay level is X, and to somebody else who works in the tax office in Sydney you are going to get paid more&mdash;' or less, or whatever. So it allows other variables, like cost of living and so on, to be taken into account irrespective of the nature of the work undertaken. That is something that I do not think any fair&hyphen;minded Australian wants to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving amendments, amongst others, which seek to impose reasonable limits on the power of the agency heads, and in particular to prevent them from taking action which would diminish the provisions of an award or a certified agreement. We support a strong, unified and apolitical public service. We believe that to achieve this aim, and the aim of the simplification, the amendments that Labor will be putting forward must be passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me thank senators from the Democrats and the opposition for their contribution today. A number of points have arisen, and I will deal with each in turn although somewhat briefly, because I think a lot of these issues can be canvassed during the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that in relation to the motion moved by the Democrats, and that is that there be a period of time whereby this bill is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not debated so that regulations and the guidelines or commissioner's directions can be settled, is not acceptable to the government. The government is of the view that it would not be possible to prepare final versions of those until the bill had been passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned earlier, draft regulations were made available to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and also to senators from the opposition and minor parties. As well as that, there has been a good deal of scrutiny in relation to this bill. We have had a lengthy consultation process. We looked at some 300 submissions. There was consultation with over 1,500 people, many of whom were public servants at all levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison from the Democrats has mentioned that there were focus groups which looked at this bill. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts handed down a thoroughly professional and comprehensive report. The Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee also took evidence and handed down a report. The minister has mentioned in the other place that the government has taken on board many of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and those amendments have now been incorporated in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the whistleblowers provisions are concerned&mdash;and I note Senator Murray's comments in relation to that; I know that that is something that he has been involved with during his time here&mdash;the government is of view that this is not the vehicle for such legislation. In fact on page 64 the joint committee recognised `that the  Public Service Bill 1997  is not the ideal framework within which to provide an extensive whistleblower protection scheme.' It is a view shared by the government. This aspect has been referred to the Attorney&hyphen;General, who is now looking at it I am advised, and I think that is an appropriate course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as tenure of employment is concerned&mdash;a number of senators mentioned this&mdash;it is the government's view that this bill does not undermine employment arrangements for public servants. The main avenue for setting pay and conditions for public servants will continue to be via agreements under the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8901"> Workplace Relations Act. It is considered that these agreements are underpinned by the protection afforded by that act and the no disadvantage test ensures that, taken as a whole, employees will not be worse off under those agreements. The government has looked at the proposed amendments put forward by the opposition and the Democrats and does not support or agree with those amendments. Therefore, in the committee stage we will not be agreeing to those proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government acknowledges the very important job that the Australian Public Service carries out. I for one, as a minister and as a backbencher in opposition, have been very impressed by the standard of officers I have dealt with. I believe that those comments were reinforced by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the other place. What we are looking at here is a long overdue reform. The common thread in the submissions by a number of senators has been that we do need to reform this 1922 act, which has been amended over 100 times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the last government that commissioned the McLeod report and was on its way to reforming this legislation. The starting point is that there is virtual unanimity in the need for reformation. I refer to comments made by other senators in relation to that. At the end of the day, the government will be proceeding with this bill as one which will reform the Australian Public Service, which will benefit both the Australian public service and the people of Australia. The government is unable to agree to the amendments which have been foreshadowed by both the Democrats and the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to opposition amendment No. 3, which I think is one of the most important amendments that we are to deal with in this committee stage debate, the government has agreed&mdash;following some extensive deliberation on this particular issue during the JCPA inquiry and also a very clear recommendation from the JCPA&mdash;to include a definition of `merit' in the legislation in clause 10 values. We believe it is more appropriate here in the interpretation section where it will have application throughout the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our definition also requires that merit be the sole rather than the primary consideration, as in the government definition. We are concerned that `primary' denotes that other factors could be considered, in which case the merit principle would be compromised. I would be interested to hear the government's view on this particular matter. If the government agreed to drop part (d) of clause 10(2), I do not think there would be any need for the opposition to pursue this issue and we could effectively drop our (b).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendment No. 10 effectively relates to the government's definition of merit. If opposition amendment No. 3 is successful, there will obviously be a need to delete (2), as provided for in opposition amendment No. 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to opposition amendment No. 21, the bill proposes to devolve all appointment powers to agency heads. This will encourage what I have indicated in my second reading speech: division and fragmentation of Australian Public Service agencies as well as what I think will be unnecessary duplication of recruitment procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendment is an attempt to balance such fragmentation by maintaining a central APS&hyphen;wide recruitment process. We believe that it will also have the effect of helping to maintain the Australian Public Service as a career service. It is more efficient than each department running its own entry level recruitment. The opposition believes that

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendment No. 23 would preserve application of the merit principle. The government's draft directions provide for a 12&hyphen;month threshold which we believe would totally undermine the merit principle. The current threshold is three months, unless the Public Service Commission determines otherwise after consultation with the relevant staff organisation or organisations. I believe that these four amendments do have merit, and I certainly commend them to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

The reason I say that is that I am inclined to agree to amendment No. 3. I think this question of merit is very important. I can see the logic of the argument that has been advanced by the mover on the question of merit. Of course, amendment No. 10, as I understand it&mdash;unless you can correct me&mdash;is consequential; it is to omit subclause (2) of clause 10. No. 23 deals with engagement and promotion based on merit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But amendment No. 21 is a different kettle of fish. It really is to concentrate all of it into the hands of the commissioner. I do not think that will be necessary if you have the definition of merit and the requirement as to merit actually in the legislation. I know that the minister has said that it is in the directions. I have had a look at page 8 of the commission's directions. Yes, it is there, but I think the key point there, as mentioned in the opposition's amendment, is the key qualifier; that is, that the sole consideration and deci

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendment No. 6 is self-explanatory. I might say there is no other mention in the bill of the need for transparency of APS procedures, which is an important element of APS accountability to the parliament and to the public. Opposition amendment No. 7 is also very important, in our view. This bill removes all of the current act's provisions on industrial democracy. We think the legislation should at least recognise that APS management's responsibilities go beyond consultation and communication with the work force to include negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to opposition amendment No. 8, we say that legislation which expands the powers of agency heads and puts such emphasis on the responsibilities and obligations of APS employees should at least contain a brief statement of their rights and entitlements. This is, in fact, a condensed version of the statement of rights and entitlements that was recommended by Mr McLeod in his report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that all the values in opposition amendment No.9 are of sufficient importance to be included in clause 10: subclause (l) is taken from the heading of clause 18; paragraph (m) is based on the language of section 33(1)(a) in the current act; paragraph (n) is designed to help preserve the APS as a career service, which is essential if it is to remain an effective repository of knowledge about government administration and service delivery; and paragraph (o) reflects the importance of having an independent appeal mechanism.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would expect the Commissioner's Direction on the APS Values to clarify the meaning and intent of the Values, to the extent that the Values are unclear.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of the commissioner's directions should surely be not only to ensure that the APS incorporates the APS values, but also that it upholds them. This would be consistent with the terminology used in clause 12. Paragraphs (a) and (b) should be complementary, hence `and' instead of `or'; and the commissioner should only be circumscribing the application of the values where necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Admittedly, this is perhaps a bit woolly, but at least it gives an indication of parliament's concern that the commissioner should only be limiting the application of values where it is absolutely essential&mdash;for example, a case of positive discrimination for EEO reasons. As I say, these values are arguably the centrepiece of this legislation. As far as the opposition is concerned, this is an important amendment and I commend it to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make those values set out in clause 10 sensible to the people who have to carry them out, the commissioner then has to give directions. The way clause 11 is phrased makes it a bit difficult to understand what it is on about. It states:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will need to take a little of the committee's time, if I may, because this is a fairly extensive amendment. It is one which is very important in accountability terms and very important to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of amendments are colloquially known as whistleblower amendments, and they are well known in those terms. But probably the better and more dispassionate term is `public disclosures', because that is what it is about. The problem with whistleblower talk is that it tends to have a lot of baggage that comes with it, and people think of informers and of people getting victimised, et cetera. But some legislations in fact do use the term in their actual descriptions, as indeed does this bill. I think the government is to be commended for its clause 16 because, to my knowledge, it is one of the first times that the Commonwealth has in fact advanced the cause of whistleblowers, in however minor a sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whistleblower legislation and amendments are not exceptional; they are not unusual. They are well established throughout the civilised world. In our own country in 1993 and 1994, whistleblower laws were passed in South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT, and a limited form of whistleblower protection is now in place in Western Australia. But I must tell you&mdash;as you would expect&mdash;that no government has come willingly to this particular legislative table, because whistleblower legislation increases accountability and decreases the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8929"> ability of those who would wish to exercise undue influence, patronage and, sometimes, corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw your attention to a really first&hyphen;rate report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing in August 1994 titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the public interest</EMPHASIS>. There were five members: Senator Jocelyn Newman was the Chair; Senator Shayne Murphy was the Deputy Chair; Senator Paul Calvert was a member; then Senator Christabel Chamarette was a member; and Senator Kay Denman was a member. That was five very experienced and capable people in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will draw your attention, if I may, to the part of the report headed `Summary of conclusions and recommendations' on page (xiii). The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges that whistleblowing is a legitimate form of action within a democracy and that there have been, there are, and there will continue to be occasions on which whistleblowing is the only available avenue for the concerned ethical citizen to expose wrongdoing in the public or private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that a fundamental shift in Australian values and ethics is necessary to overcome the stigma and trauma associated with whistleblowing. Notwithstanding the recommendations in this report, the Committee encourages organisations and institutions in both the public and private sectors, to reassess the value of reporting wrong&hyphen;doing and welcomes any initiatives, programs or strategies aimed at addressing this culture-change. The Committee appreciates that, notwithstanding the implementation of any legislative initiatives recommended in this report, in order to effect a shift in traditional workplace values and ethics, legislation must be accompanied by national leadership and education programs specifically targeted at workplace ethics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I quote that to you to indicate that we are well aware that what we propose here in amendment No. 2 needs to be accompanied by other measures. But then the report goes on in (xiv):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the practice of whistleblowing should be the subject of Commonwealth legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is very important to emphasise. That committee, headed by Senator Newman, and with Senators Murphy, Calvert, Chamarette and Denman, unanimously pro

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8930"> ty. Why I am at pains to quote from those two reports is to indicate the importance of this kind of proposal to accountability and to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the minister has said that this matter has been referred to the Attorney&hyphen;General. My attitude to that is as follows. The whistleblower amendment we have put before you is drawn from the acts and the recommendations which I have described. It is not exceptional; it is tried and tested. It has not resulted in the collapse of good government in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia or the ACT; in fact, it has contributed to that good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whistleblowers often have a reputation as being obsessive. The reason they become obsessive is that the way in which they are victimised and pursued to arrive at their disclosure forces them to become absolutely single minded. This sort of legislation takes that kind of pressure off and allows the proper disclosure of improper behaviour to occur in a controlled environment. Senators such as Senator Calvert, who was involved with that report, will recognise in this amendment some of the language you yourselves used and which we have expressed in consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the remaining minutes, I will take you briefly through the amendments I have to part 2 on sheet 758. The object of the part in 19A clearly states the intention to provide for disclosures by Australian government service employees in the public interest. The object sets out the three principal elements of the whistleblowers legislative framework which are the means by which disclosures may be made, the protection for whistleblowers and investigation of the disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think these amendments could save Australian taxpayers millions of dollars in public funds, money which, in the past, has been lost because APS employees felt they could not speak out about corruption or fraud that they may have witnessed or been suspicious of because either they were subject to secrecy provisions, they were not afforded protection or they felt that their jobs, or at least their promotion, could be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our 19B refers to application of the part. We should note that these amendments are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not retrospective. They only apply to disclosures made or reprisal action taken against whistleblowers after the commencement of the act and we think that is consistent with natural justice and principles of fairness which demand that such acts cannot retrospectively be made illegal. The `Interpretation' establishes the important definitions and bodies set up by the Democrats amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In 19D, immunity for public interest disclosures, this section removes liability of an APS employee who makes a public interest disclosure in good faith to a list of disclosure agencies including: the public interest disclosure agency, which Senator Calvert would recognise, which is the one which pursues the matter of investigations; the whistleblowers protection agency&mdash;that is the agency which protects the whistleblower, and they have to be separate; you cannot have the investigative authority and the protective authority as one and the same&mdash;an agency head or appropriately authorised person; the commissioner; or the Merit Protection Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APS employee who complies with the section has a defence of absolute privilege for publishing the information and is deemed not to have contravened any act, oath, rule of law or practice and is not liable for any disciplinary action. Those of you who have any military background might remember that you cannot be required to obey an unlawful order. That is the equivalent in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 19E, disclosures to other persons permitted in certain circumstances: once a public interest disclosure has been made to the appropriate agency or body listed, the APS employee may make substantially the same disclosure to a member of parliament or to a journalist in limited circumstances. That may surprise you, but the second most important agency of democracy that we have is the media. After parliament, they are the people who push out the information. There is a delay of six months between the disclosure to the PIDA&mdash;the public interest disclosure agency&mdash;and a permitted disclosure to a member of parliament or a journalist. This should mean that the PIDA could answer questions about the reported allegations and determine whether or not it is being treated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8931"> seriously and pursued. That is a fail&hyphen;safe situation. If something is suppressed, then the media or parliament will get access to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 19F, public interest disclosures, it sets out what constitutes a public interest disclosure. Under the government bill, an APS employee could make allegations of breaches of the code of conduct established under the bill. The Democrats' amendments dramatically broaden the scope of the possible disclosures that may be made by whistleblowers to include&mdash;now, who would oppose these?&mdash;serious or substantial waste of public money&mdash;no&hyphen;one; an abuse of authority by an APS employee&mdash;maybe some of you might; an act constituting or resulting in substantial danger to public health or safety&mdash;I would not think anyone opposes that; or the suppression of an expert opinion, finding or document prepared by another person&mdash;one or two of you might worry about that one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions will enable APS employees to report allegations or make disclosures which may save Australian taxpayers millions of dollars and they are consistent with the warnings of royal commissions and inquiries which have recommended that whistleblowers be protected and structures be put in place to ensure whistleblowing is possible in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given you a fairly lengthy introduction because I think it is necessary to do so. I have further points to make, but I will take inquiries if you wish to ask me further questions about the amendments before you. Therefore, I commend the amendments to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a very brief preliminary contribution on Senator Murray's amendments and explain to the committee what the approach of the opposition will be on this matter. I want to say to Senator Murray that the sorts of issues that he canvassed at the deliberations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts were perhaps in many ways the most difficult that we had to grapple with; difficult because the issue was: how do you effectively deal with these matters in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> ? That, I think, is the fundamental issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the committee decided&mdash;and this was a matter on which there was unanimity between government and opposition senators&mdash;that it was more appropriate to address these particular matters through separate legislation. That is not to say that the issues that Senator Murray canvasses in his speech and the issues that Senator Murray's  amendment deals with are not important ones for this parliament to give appropriate consideration to. The view of the opposition, having looked at this exhaustively through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts process, was that the most appropriate vehicle for us to deal with these matters was separate whistleblowers legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been convinced by Senator Murray's contribution that that is still not the case. The issue for Senator Murray to give consideration to is the appropriateness or otherwise of using the  Public Service Bill 1997  as a vehicle for this sort of protection for these quite significant amendments to the legislation. I have no doubt that in your considerations, Senator Murray, you have thought long and hard about that issue. I appreciate that that would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you in the strongest possible terms that perhaps it might be more appropriate to be trying to obtain from Senator Ellison some commitments about what the government might be willing to do in terms of whistleblower legislation, whether the government will bring such legislation before the parliament, and whether the government contemplates this as a priority for government in this particular parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, the substantive matters that you have dealt with in your contributions are ones that we also believe are very important in terms of their receiving an adequate level of parliamentary scrutiny. I suspect that a number of the propositions you put forward might be embraced by the parliament. With others, perhaps that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, through you Madam Temporary Chair, I say to Senator Murray that the problem the opposition has with what you are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8932"> proposing is using this particular bill as a vehicle to achieve those outcomes. I do not think it is appropriate. I think it would be better for separate legislation to come before this parliament and for it to be given the focus and the attention that the issues you raise deserve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The points Senator Faulkner made are good ones which we have taken into consideration. It is true that separate legislation might well sit better, but our fear is that the coalition government will not introduce whistleblower legislation and, therefore, we have thought it appropriate to bring it forward&mdash;and that is why I emphasised the unexceptional nature of the clauses we have put forward&mdash;in this bill. If, in due course, the coalition introduces its own bill, it can repeal this and bring on its own legislation in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point concerns the nature of the  Public Service Bill 1997  itself. By and large, in my opinion, that bill is a bill about the terms and conditions of employment for public service employees. I believe that terms and conditions of employment include the proper protection which should be accorded to employees in the carrying out of their duties. Plainly, you can take that too far. You cannot put in every health and safety regulation that exists, or every possible outcome that could be dealt with under the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, this is a government which is materially changing the nature of public service employment and opening it up to a far less traditional, a far less governed environment in which public servants are more at the discretion of their particular employer, from the minister down to heads of departments. In that environment it is going to be more difficult, not easier, for them to blow the whistle, to make disclosures, because their jobs are more at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet many public servants&mdash;probably most of the public servants, and certainly the people I have met&mdash;would have a very ethical view and would like to be able to carry out their jobs on an ethical basis. They may feel constrained from blowing the whistle. When 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we are dealing, as we do in this parliament and as the government does in its duties, with billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, I think it is appropriate that when we are changing the very nature of the legislation which governs the Public Service they are given appropriate legislative protection. That legislative protection is not provided by clause 16, as you would readily admit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is so, my attitude is, by all means let the government improve my unexceptional amendments, which are based on tried and tested law elsewhere in this country; by all means let them introduce their own stand&hyphen;alone legislation and repeal this; but for as long as this does not exist, there is a gaping hole in the protection accorded to our public service employees and in the area of accountability which was not there under the old act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public servants are in a more vulnerable situation. We are in a more vulnerable situation under this bill because these protections do not exist. It is for that reason that I have added them in here. The arguments you put are very good ones, and I acknowledge them, but if the coalition does not introduce whistleblower legislation, and there is no means to go back to this issue, what are we to do? We are going to be left without it. They are going to be left vulnerable, and the parliament is going to be left vulnerable. It is for those reasons that I have put this case to you and have put these amendments in the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray is a person who has done much for civil liberties and for the ordinary person not only in this country but also in other countries, but I must say that the amendments he is suggesting here are&mdash;unintentionally on his part&mdash;oppressive. For example, his proposed clause 19T headed `Persons not to refuse to furnish information' goes on to say how a person must give over information, even though that information can be used in a criminal prosecution. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is not liable to a penalty under the provisions of any other enactment by reason of furnishing that information . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a provision which takes away the right to silence. I have become a great admirer of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8933"> right to silence, largely may I say because of the arguments I have heard from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Senator Ellison) over the years in this place. He is a person who has, in my view, a great sense of what the appropriate balance is between the need to see wrongs suppressed and the need to ensure that people are entitled to live in an appropriate way. I would like to acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Perhaps what I am talking about is best summarised in some words expressed by Mr John Coldrey QC, who was Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria at the time he gave this paper in July 1990 and who has since gone on to become a Supreme Court justice. He said this in a paper entitled `The right to silence reassessed':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to silence has formed an integral part of the English criminal justice system, and those systems based upon it, for the last 300 years. The concept has survived despite periodic criticism of it. Consequently it is not unreasonable to cast upon those who seek its abolition or modification the onus of justifying the necessity for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present balance in the criminal justice system is, it appears to me, designed to prevent what most persons would regard as the ultimate injustice. This is not that guilty people are acquitted, but that innocent people are convicted. Assuming that the proponents of abolition or modification subscribe to the same value system, it would seem imperative that any evidentiary procedures they might postulate in substitution for the status quo do not increase the possibilities of injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, and always will be, an uneasy tension in the administration of the criminal law between the competing public interests of convicting the guilty and protecting individual citizens from unfair, illegal or arbitrary treatment. There is ample scope for persons of goodwill to differ as to where the balance between these competing interests should be struck. Commenting on the question of balance Mr. Justice Vincent of the Victorian Supreme Court has remarked:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"The task is to recognise that the problem which exists in the community in relation to criminal behaviour is, in a sense, part of the price which is paid for freedom. It is important to understand that there is a balance to be struck between these respective interests; . . . that we are aware of the importance of that balance and do not, in any enthusiastic endeavour to prevent particular forms of anti&hyphen;social behaviour, create a situation which threatens individual liberties 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that every man, woman and child in this community are entitled to." </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the price paid for the right to silence too great?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments proposed by Senator Murray take away the right to silence. I must make a distinction here between the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself&mdash;they are two different rights. There is a right that people have that they should not incriminate themselves and there is a right that people have to silence. In my view, these amendments interfere with both those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the enthusiasm to wash misbehaviour and bad conduct out of the Public Service, which is a noble purpose, these amendments propose to introduce into the Public Service the sort of investigative techniques and oppressive conducts that will not apply to the rest of the community. There are all sorts of problems with these particular amendments. First, it will introduce a culture of informing, and that would be a very bad thing. If I can read another quote that I have used before in the Senate and that I quoted earlier today, which is from a statement made in 1846&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;but which has been used by the courts from time to time since then. The Vice-Chancellor Sir Knight Bruce made this statement in Pearse v. Pearse:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In my view, the sorts of oppressive proceedings that these amendments introduce fall into that category of things that the Vice-Chancellor would not go along with. For example, proposed clause 19V states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commissioner or an authorised person may, at any reasonable time of the day, enter any place occupied by an Agency, and may carry on the investigation at that place.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are police powers given to people who are not police. There has been growth over the 1980s and 1990s of powers that are given to people who are not even members of the police force. They are powers that go beyond 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8934"> what the police themselves have. There has been an increase in the investigative procedures that have come about in the community and a proliferation&mdash;I use that word advisedly&mdash;of bodies that investigate people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we doing to the community? What are we trying to do? Where are we going to stop? When are people's rights and liberties going to be given the respect that they are entitled to? When is the climate of informing, of investigating, of putting people on the spot going to stop? When are the rights of individuals to go about living their lives in a reasonable fashion going to come about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of legislation makes it very easy for people to put other people into embarrassing situations and to inform on them in a way that makes it very difficult to counter. It is the sort of thing that I think we should go into only after the most exhaustive consideration and after the most protracted debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in this adjournment debate to call on the New South Wales Labor government to use its legal powers to stop the intended closure of the St George campus of the University of New South Wales. A major row has erupted over this decision taken by the council of the University of New South Wales and its Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Professor John Niland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the closure of the St George campus is allowed to proceed, the New South Wales Labor government will create a very disastrous impact on higher education in southern Sydney. A premier school of teacher education&mdash;one with an incredibly high reputation and one of the best teacher education schools in New South Wales&mdash;will be lost forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an institution which has a very long record of excellence. One thousand places will be lost and 300 third&hyphen;year students who were promised the chance to finish their degree at the University of New South Wales will be disadvantaged. These losses to teacher education will occur at a time when the Preston report has shown growing shortages in teacher education in New South Wales and elsewhere. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8936">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed closure of the only higher education facility in southern Sydney, an area of 700,000 people, will mean that those people will be left without any tertiary education provision. Citizens of the municipalities of Hurstville, Kogarah, Rockdale and Sutherland will be adversely affected by the closure of the St George campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story of this campus dates back to 1980. The buildings were constructed in the 1970s with funds supplied by the Commonwealth. These building were to replace the former Alexander Mackie Teachers College as the St George Institute of Higher Education, which was part of the Sydney College of Advanced Education. The land was purchased by the New South Wales government and over a period of 20 years the Commonwealth government invested $150 million of recurrent and capital expenditure in this site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Dawkins amalgamations, this institution was transferred to the University of New South Wales by the then state government at a peppercorn rent of $1. The University of New South Wales now finds that campus surplus to its requirements and it is determined to sell or to lease it. To lease the 15,000 square metres of floor space at $300 per square metre could deliver to the University of New South Wales a $4.5 million annual return. All the people who invested in the Telstra float would be drooling at that sort of investment&mdash;$4.5 million a year for a $1 initial investment. This handsome dividend is on current tracking going to be allowed by the New South Wales Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the community interest in the provision of higher education in this region? Today the campus is equipped with fine functioning, purpose&hyphen;built, teacher education facilities and sports science facilities. It is the only campus in the geographical region of southern Sydney. It is a full 75&hyphen;minute journey by public transport from this campus at Oatley to Kensington&mdash;the trek that many will have to make; otherwise they will have to go to the University of Western Sydney or the University of Wollongong, which are at greater distances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are advised by Colliers Jardine, who are responsible under the aegis of the University 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of New South Wales for leasing the property, that expressions of interest close on 28 November this year. The expression of interest is to use the site for `educational purposes'. This is vague and not specific. If a party decides to take up the lease, the whole deal could be stitched up by mid-December this year when the University of New South Wales Council meets. Depending on the terms of the lease, which could be something like a 20-year lease, then the control of government or the possible control of government over the use of that site will be gone forever under such a situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with this, what is the reaction of the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training? On 2UE a year ago he said he was quite happy for this campus to be transferred to the University of Wollongong; he really did not have a problem with that concept all. But everything that he has done&mdash;or to be more correct, has not done&mdash;in the last year indicates that he has no interest in that course of action occurring and, therefore, no interest in the provision of higher education staying in the southern Sydney area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All he has to do&mdash;and the power is with the state minister&mdash;is to change the University of New South Wales Act. That would then give him control over what the University of New South Wales is doing. As the act currently stands, the minister has the power to stop the sale, but he does not have any power to stop leasing&mdash;that is under the aegis of the University of New South Wales. All the legal obligations rest with the New South Wales parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have condemned on many occasions the New South Wales minister for his inaction on this matter. He has even attempted the very slippery tactic of creating a smokescreen by saying that he was going to lead a delegation to the federal minister. The federal minister has no power in this matter. Minister Aquilina, the state minister, can change it by amending the act. He could also pursue another suggested solution to the problem by legislating the transfer of the St George site to the University of Wollongong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of New South Wales, with the inaction of the New South Wales Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8937"> government, remains able to thumb its nose at the local community represented by a number of groups and individuals who demand that St George stay open as a higher education facility. These include Associate Professor Alan Watson of the St George 2000 Committee; the mayors of four municipality councils&mdash;Hurstville, Kogarah, Sutherland and Rockdale; and federal and New South Wales members of parliament, both Liberal and Labor, all of whom have met on a number of occasions. I do not think in my time in politics I have seen such a united show of action at all levels of government by all parties against this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Minister Aquilina do? Sit on his hands, do nothing, just let the whole thing slide away and let the University of New South Wales get its way on this matter. There is a very strong case for retaining the St George campus as a specialist teacher education facility. The Mayor of Kogarah, Councillor James Jordan, has taken action by writing to Colliers Jardine, who have control over the lease on behalf of the University of New South Wales, reflecting the anger and determination of the local community. The mayor wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are presumably aware that any development proposal will require an application to be submitted to the Council for community notification and determination. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You must also be aware of the very widespread community opposition that has been expressed about the lease or sale of the property. We are committed to ensuring the site remains as a university.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The University of New South Wales and potential lessees should beware as a result of that statement by the local mayor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to congratulate the initiative shown by the Liberal shadow minister for education and training in New South Wales, Stephen O'Doherty. He has tabled a private member's bill to do exactly what the Labor minister is failing to do. I hope, along with the St George community, that John Aquilina will act in this crisis to save the St George campus. His actions to date have been spineless. He needs to develop backbone quickly to save St George for the people of southern

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today was a most appropriate day for former Nixon henchman Chuck Colson to have visited this parliament. If he had been at question time in the House of Representatives, he would have seen a very Nixonian thing. He would have seen the Prime Minister of this country refuse to answer a specific four part question about the Prime Minister's own standards and behaviour. He would have seen, instead, a Prime Minister going into an hysterical rant, attacking Mr Beazley and Mr Evans, knowing that the evidence is to the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you when this tale started. On 8 April 1997 the Prime Minister presumably told Mr Jull and Mr Williams to have their departments search their records of the previous government of 1983 in matters pertaining to Senator Colston. These requests occurred simultaneously for Mr Williams and Mr Jull to their departments. Both departments refused the request. Their refusal was backed up by advice from the deputy secretary of PM&amp;C who also said that these ministers were not entitled to those records. The next step by the government was to have Mr Howard write to Mr Beazley seeking Mr Beazley's permission for the current government to have the files of the previous government dating back to 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley generously concedes and grants that permission and puts a request in that any such documents available to the government be made available to him. Immediately, both departments are informed. Whilst not shown Mr Beazley's letter and the conditionality of his letter, both departments are informed that they can now produce the documents, and both did. In the case of Attorney-General's, they found the files. They passed them on to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), showing him the original that he had to sight and sign for. He then gave copies of that file to a member of his staff to walk around to the Prime Minister's office. DAS behaved similarly. They passed on the file to Mr Jull who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8938"> also passed it on to the Prime Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on 11 April the Prime Minister writes to Mr Beazley and says the departments&mdash;plural&mdash;have searched their records and he is passing on the documents to Mr Beazley. Guess what? Of all the documents that were around, the two critical documents were not passed on from Attorney-General's. They were deleted somewhere. I will come back to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 11 April, just to make sure, the Prime Minister's office asked an officer from Prime Minister and Cabinet to come over and check the documents to assess the suitability of whether these documents go on to Mr Beazley. That officer, by his own minute, is only shown the DAS file, deliberately, in the Prime Minister's office. The A&hyphen;G's file was not shown to Mr Lang, who ticked off the DAS documents to go to Mr Beazley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bad enough a government deleting these documents, but they did not even have the expert from PM&amp;C check whether they were suitable documents to go on. He was not even shown them. But guess what? Quotes from those two documents deleted started to leak out to the press. They were read to the press, not shown to them, by the media officer in the Prime Minister's office. And they start appearing in newspapers in very selective quotes, not the whole document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see here are these documents that Mr Beazley approved, which they otherwise would not have had access to, not being given to Mr Beazley or Mr Evans and then, in total breach of the Archives Act, being selectively leaked bit by bit to the media but leaving out the crucial paragraphs. So we have in Mr Alan Ramsey's column bits and pieces of it quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was bad enough, but on 29 September, 30 September and 1 October we had Mr Howard and Mr Costello walking into the House of Representatives under pressure on travel matters and resignations of ministers and launching a vicious attack on Mr Beazley and Mr Evans. The nature of that attack was that they conspired to ignore the advice of the head of the Attorney-General's Department and the Chief General Counsel. They were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alleged to be perverters of the course of justice. Yet what do the two documents hidden, deleted, somewhere in the Prime Minister's office show? Document No. 1, if you like, dated 14 September signed by Mr Brazil points out that the one piece of evidentiary evidence that the Prime Minister relies on is in fact wrong&mdash;the so-called Holdich note of 23 August. Mr Brazil on 14 September says in fact it is a distortion of the Attorney's view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on 18 September both Mr Brazil and Mr Tom Sherman sign off an aide memoire in which they concur with the Attorney's actions. They even give their specific reasons why the Attorney acted appropriately. These two documents that would have been valuable in the debate somehow disappeared out of the system. The Labor Party is deprived of them whilst the Prime Minister's media spinners go out there to try to reinforce the Prime Minister and other people's accusations in regard to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked some questions on this. We have asked who walked around the documents from the A&hyphen;G's office and who did they give them to in the Prime Minister's office. We do not have any answers to those questions. We do not have answers to questions as to how they happened to disappear. There are two theories here. One is that some sneaky, unprincipled staff member just pocketed them and thought, `These will be really handy. We'll be able to make hay while the sun shines.' I must say, I hope that happened. I hope it was not the Prime Minister who authorised this act. Until today, I did not think it was. I did not think the Prime Minister could sink to such low depths as to delete documents such as this and then misuse the generosity of the Leader of the Opposition who said, `Sure, you can go back into the files.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just so people understand, it is a convention in this place, in this parliament, that a new government does not have access to the files of the previous government, except for one condition&mdash;for purposes of continuity, and none of us begrudge that. I should say that, when that is invoked, generally those files are not shown to the new government but a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8939"> position summary is done by a departmental officer and is passed on to the government. There are obvious reasons why the new government does need to know about some of the decisions and issues that the previous government considered&mdash;so that they know what the trade-offs were so they can govern appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back 13 years was nothing to do with continuity; going back 13 years was just for political purposes. But those political purposes are ill&hyphen;served when, having got the documents only on the permission of Mr Beazley&mdash;they could not get them otherwise&mdash;they do not pass those documents on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This actually fits a pattern that is starting emerge in this country, that the Prime Minister's office, through a whole series of sneaky manoeuvres, is becoming absolutely Nixonian. We went through the episode of how Labor ministers were targeted for legitimate repayments to be asterisked. But for those Liberal ministers who made repayments, of course, Mr Morris and Mr Sutherland and others conspired to make sure they were not highlighted in any way. This is a total misuse of office and it is not the first time that the Prime Minister's media office has been engaged in this sort of manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again, I really do hope the Prime Minister had nothing to do with this sordid affair, but it makes you wonder. On 29 October, the Prime Minister was finally given a letter to send to Mr Evans, including the documents and some sort of explanation as to what happened. Up until this morning no correspondence arrived and, when it did, it was quite obvious that the new letter was just prepared yesterday or today under pressure. In fact it was completely different from the one on the 29th.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a government that will stoop to any Nixonian level for political manipulation. They are going to get exposed on this and other similar issues if they continue to behave this way. I cannot think of one occasion in the 13 years of Labor government when we went back to the files of the previous government. Not on one occasion did we do so. Yet here we have a government that is totally unprincipled and a Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister's office that is totally out of control. If he wants to retain some reputation for integrity he should take action&mdash;have an investigation, find out who is responsible, give them the Grahame Morris treatment and put them out the door.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8939"><TITLE>Small Business</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time to discuss some ethical franchising tactics. The prompt response of the Liberal government to the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> , produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, is indeed to be applauded. A very extensive and thorough investigation into unfair conduct by big business towards small business was carried out and the speed with which the government has acted on its report will be warmly welcomed by many in the small business community. Tonight I wish to stress that it is not only big business that can act unscrupulously towards small business; some small businesses can in relation to other small businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Labor Party's 13 years in office, 17 fair trading reports, reviews or draft proposals, were unfortunately shelved, ignored or deferred. In stark contrast, within just 18 weeks of the report being tabled, the coalition Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith, made public the government's commitment to end the Trade Practices Act so that small business would be protected in its commercial dealings with big business. Enabling legislation, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  will be introduced shortly I think into the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepted all the recommendations of the report, either fully or in part, taking into account the powers of the Commonwealth as well as ensuring that the greatest benefits and the least obstacles were achieved for small business. In the area of franchising, for example, the committee recommended that the franchising code of practice and the other relevant codes should provide for full disclosure of information related to rental, outgoings, promotion ex 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8940"> penses, tenancy mix and redevelopment proposals to franchisees who sub&hyphen;let their premises from the franchisor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also recommended that the Commonwealth enact specific franchising legislation providing for compulsory registration of franchisors and compliance with codes of practice. The  legislation provides for adequate disclosure documentation, the establishment of appropriate independent code administration bodies and dispute resolution procedures funded through compulsory registration fees. These measures taken by the government with regard to franchises should go a long way to preventing catastrophes similar to the one in which a couple of my constituents found themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to take this opportunity to draw the attention of honourable senators to the unscrupulous methods used by the Copperart franchising system. Over a period of five years, constituents of mine who have been involved in franchising for approximately 18 years and who owned two Copperart franchises in Tasmania, lost approximately $300,000 through being associated with this particular company. Since August last year the number of Copperart franchises has dropped from 78 to less than 10. Many like my constituents have lost almost everything through what appears to be a deliberate ploy by Copperart to rid the system of franchises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Copperart, it would seem, is forcing businesses out by financially undermining the profitability and viability of the stores and forcing franchisees to breach their franchise agreements. This is done by inhibiting cash flow through stock supply and price manipulation, and forcing them into debt with Copperart&mdash;through rent, for example. The Managing Director of Copperart, Mr Aart van Roest, a former bankrupt, has a track record of misleading and deceptive conduct. He is on record in the Federal Court in the case, Finch v. Copperart, in which Aart van Roest misled the former franchisee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents said that as a director on the Franchising Code Council for four years he had never experienced such a ruthless approach as that undertaken by Copperart in crucifying the majority of its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> franchisees. From his position on the council he noted that when there were signs that the council would be winding up and the voluntary code of practice would not be enforceable&mdash;that was in August 1996&mdash;Mr &amp; Mrs van Roest's attitude towards their franchises changed notably. While the council was in existence there was quite a respect for its powers and role. Copperart was looking for credibility and willingly provided documents for existing and incoming franchisees such as regarding disclosure. When the council folded they disregarded all such obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main component of my constituents' $300,000 loss was for goodwill paid to Copperart for the purchase of the franchise over their two stores. They did anticipate selling their stores to incoming franchisees looking for a suitable business. Unfortunately, prospective buyers would decide against buying once they learnt the truth about the decline in the franchisee numbers and the reasons for this decline. Any goodwill was lost under these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government has now legislated to strengthen the franchising code by making it mandatory. The Trade Practices Act will be used to underpin vital elements of the code such as pre&hyphen;contractual disclosure. Under the legislation a Franchising Policy Council will be set up consisting of three members representing franchisees, three representing franchisors, two service provider representatives and an independent chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their first assignment will be to advise and report to the government on the recommended terms of the mandatory code, including the definition of the `franchise system' for the purposes of the code and whether any sector of the franchising industry should or should not be exempt from the recommended provisions of the mandatory code. A continuing role for the council will be to advise the government on policy issues associated with the code, many of which were raised by the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Codes of Conduct Enforcement Unit will be established under the legislation within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor and enforce this mandatory franchising code. The government is also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8941"> keen to see alternative dispute resolution mechanisms set up to reduce litigation and legal costs. The government will appoint a dispute resolution adviser to assist parties to avoid disputes and to reduce the time required to solve a dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many former franchisees with similar stories to my constituents. My constituents have lost a lifetime of savings through these unscrupulous entrepreneurs because of the tardiness of the previous government in implementing effective measures to counter underhand trading practices within the franchise industry. Once the government's legislation is passed, other innocent people will be able to have confidence that the law will give them protection against unethical tactics of franchisors such as those experienced by my constituents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, in good faith, fully understanding there might even be some perceived collateral damage through the release of these documents, said to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, in April, `Yes. You can have access to documents from that period from the archives as long as I receive copies of all documents.' Of course the Prime Minister wrote back and agreed to that process. But did the Prime Minister keep his word on this? The answer to that is absolutely not. The Prime Minister took advantage of Mr Beazley's sense of fair play, Mr Beazley's sense of decency and, in true John Howard fashion, he dudded him. What else would you expect from a person who single&hyphen;handedly invents the dubious political concept of the non-core promise!</PARA>

When Mr Lang came over to the Prime Minister's office, strangely enough, the Attorney-General's file was locked away in a cupboard somewhere, stuffed behind the prime ministerial pot plant.

This is a Nixonian style administration that we have in this country. It is exactly what we have come to expect from the Prime Minister's way of doing business&mdash;that is, selectively leaking parts of documents to journalists without 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providing those self&hyphen;same documents to Mr Beazley. It was not good enough for the Leader of the Opposition, the man who gave permission for these documents, for these files, to be investigated, on the condition they be provided to him, to receive all the documents. When he got the documents, they had been filleted in the Prime Minister's office and selectively leaked to journalists. You might ask: is this allowed under the Archives Act? Answer: absolutely not. In fact, people in Mr Howard's office might be in very serious breach of the Archives Act by leaking this material to the press, and that is going to require further investigation on the part of the opposition. I guarantee we will look into that, and perhaps that will involve the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Yes. The Coalition policy on Defence stated "The Defence Housing Authority will give special attention to housing in isolated areas and the standard of accommodation for on-base single personnel."
