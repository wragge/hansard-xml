<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been discussion in the last few days about the threat that native title might make to freehold tenure of land. Madam President, being an excellent lawyer yourself, as I understand&mdash;almost as good as my wife, Lillian Cooney, who has given me much instruction in this area&mdash;you would know that freehold land does not mean ownership of the land in the sense of a complete right over the land. If you have a freehold piece of property all sorts of other people have rights over that, whether they are tenants, next door neighbours or, indeed, the government as a whole&mdash;for example, you cannot grow opium poppies on your land. There are all sorts of relationships between the land that you own and other people. The very fundamental basis of the English law in so far as it relates to the ownership of land is that it is a system of tenure, that is, a system whereby people have rights in respect of a piece of land which others do not have or have rights in respect of a piece of land over which others may have the same sorts of rights. The typical example given is that of the relationship between landlord and tenant, but there are others as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have copies of documents here which relate to land law and the ownership of land in Victoria&mdash;I will not read the names out; that would not be right. One letter is headed `Heritage of Victoria' and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attached is my determination for the proposed works to a former building. I have decided to refuse the issue of a permit for the proposed works.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Heritage of Victoria is refusing a person who has the ownership of land a permit to carry out the sort of work he wants. There is the Town and Planning Country Act. Here I have a planning permit from a particular council 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9596"> which is allowing the development of dwellings but subject to a series of conditions which go on for page after page. These are just illustrations of the fact that tenure of land is uncertain by nature. It is true that we want to make it as certain as possible but no&hyphen;one can, under our system of law, have a situation where their possession of land is absolutely certain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people talk about there being uncertainty in the ownership of land&mdash;as have those opposite&mdash;they are talking about something that has not been created by native title. It has been created by the English legal system which we have adopted&mdash;and a very good system it is too. When people want certainty what they want is something that has not been guaranteed to any non&hyphen;Aboriginal person who has come to Australia. It is something which they have never been guaranteed since that time and which the forerunner of our law, the English system, had never guaranteed anybody in England. You remember reading the stories of the knights, whose fealty was to the lord, villeins, and so on. That was an arrangement set up in respect of land. Nobody owned the land in the full sense of the word, but they had certain rights over the land. Why we want to change the system that has been operating all these years on this particular occasion is a little worrying. What we are talking about here&mdash;and it ought to be said again and again&mdash;is not a native system of land&hyphen;holding; it is a common law system of land&hyphen;holding that was brought to this country from England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to refer to the case of Campbell v. Hall, because it set out five principles which I think are worth keeping in mind as we are having this debate. It said that where England conquers a country, takes over a country, as it has in Australia, there are certain principles followed. I will go through some of them. The second principle is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conquered inhabitants, once received under the King's protection, become subjects, and are to be universally considered in that light, not as enemies or aliens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they become full citizens. The fifth principle is this:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The laws of a conquered country continue in force until they are altered by the conqueror.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All the High Court has been saying in Mabo and in Wik is that&mdash;that we inherited the law from English institutions which have come to us from England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Lieutenant Cook, as I remember he was when he took over Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would remember, Senator Ferguson, that at six o'clock in the evening of Wednesday, 22 August 1770 Lieutenant Cook landed on Australian soil and took possession of it in His Majesty's name and under his colours. He fired some volleys of shots and some cannons were fired from a ship. You would remember that incident. What he was doing was bringing English law to Australia. And what we are about now in our debate is not changing Aboriginal law, not changing indigenous law; we are attempting to change almost a thousand years of history, where English law set up this idea of tenure. That is what we are trying to disturb.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about uncertainty, it is uncertainty in that law, and may I suggest that it is unfair to blame the indigenous people for uncertainty when that uncertainty has been there since Captain Cook fired his cannon on that Wednesday. It is wrong for us to propound in this debate that we are trying to get rid of an uncertainty that was introduced by Aboriginals when in fact it was introduced by the British system of law.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.40 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Act 1993 is not working. The act that was supposed to create an atmosphere of certainty for indigenous Australians, for leaseholders, pastoralists and miners has failed because the Keating government failed to devise a satisfactory process of determination, which has resulted in uncertainty, animosity, cynicism and excessive legal costs for the parties involved and has stalled development in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems arising from the 1993 Native Title Act include multiple claims, because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9597"> there is no adequate threshold for the right to negotiate, no limitation on the number of claims that can be made on the same land and no time limit on the lodgment of claims. This means, in effect, that native title claims could be made forevermore, which underlines the need for a sunset clause to be included in the legislation. Any Aboriginal group with a legitimate claim to any land in Australia should be well aware of it now, and in my view there should only be a relatively short period of grace for further claims to be lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now plenty of evidence that senior ALP figures anticipated that the Native Title Act would not work when it was introduced in 1993 and that the processes provided would have to be changed. Gareth Evans, no less, made this admission recently at an AMEC lunch at the Novotel Langley Hotel in Perth, which I attended. The failure of the processes set up under the Native Title Act is illustrated by the fact that to date there have been over 660 applications for determination of native title covering about 45 per cent of Australia, and out of these 660&hyphen;plus applications only one has been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This illustrates as nothing else could the unworkability of the 1993 Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems of unworkability have been clearly recognised in the comments of the President of the Native Title Tribunal, Mr Justice Robert French, who stated on 10 March 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulties in the operation of the right to negotiate procedure relate to the ease with which a claimant can be registered and the absence of any requirement that the claimant or claimants consult with the relevant group of native title holders about the lodgment of the claim or any agreement that may be made under the procedure for which the Act provides. Overlapping claims . . . are commonplace. A significant number of claims is brought outside the framework of official representative Aboriginal bodies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the words of the President of the Native Title Tribunal, Mr Justice Robert French. His comments reflect the limitations of the current process of native title determinations, which, as I will explain, are reflected in what is happening with native title claims throughout Western Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's 10&hyphen;point plan addresses the concerns raised by Justice French and so many others about the need to streamline the processes of the Native Title Act to provide not only fair and just terms but certainty for all stakeholders. The successful passage of this bill will mean that native title rights are protected by law and will ensure that just compensation is available through the indigenous land fund. It will mean that Australian farming families and pastoral families have the certainty they need to continue running their properties. It will ensure certainty for developers and mining companies, who, I add, currently generate more than $40 billion a year, which is essential for jobs and economic growth in this country, especially for rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is a particular issue in Western Australia, because the state of Western Australia is currently subject to application for claims which cover over 82 per cent of it. Western Australia provides 31 per cent of this nation's mineral resources, which accounts for some 40 per cent of Australia's exports. The uncertainty for infrastructure development and resource exploration, especially in the north&hyphen; west of Western Australia, and the importance of such developments to the national economy comprise one of the major reasons to support the Howard government's 10&hyphen;point plan which, as I say, will bring certainty and rationality to this matter while protecting the interests of Aboriginal communities, pastoralists, miners, and developers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to illustrate how the present Native Title Act has affected ordinary people in some of the towns of the north west by causing delays in the provision of infrastructure and land for housing which have resulted in rising costs for housing, as demand outstrips supply. For example, in Port Hedland, in the light industrial area of Wedgefield, 40 lots have been delayed for light industrial development. The significance of this is that the Wedgefield light industrial area is close to the massive HBI plant, which BHP is constructing in Port Hedland at a cost now running to $2.5 billion. Because no land is available for light industrial sites, contractors have not been able to establish bases in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9598"> town. This not only has been inconvenient for these contractors but also has added enormously to the cost of their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only serviceable land by the ocean for housing development in Port Hedland is at Pretty Pool. But native title claims have prevented the development of a block of 152 lots which would have gone a long way to solving the housing shortage in the town. Similarly, in South Hedland, native title has prevented the release of land for new subdivisions for housing for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, because of the inflow of workers for the huge BHP developments in the town, housing is at a premium, and purchase and rental prices are incredibly high. For example, a four-bedroom house in Pretty Pool or Cooke Point rents commonly for $1,000 a week; in South Hedland, the same kind of house will rent for a mere $500 to $800 a week. The cheapest rental for a flat in the Hedland area is now around $300 a week. I emphasise that this is not Manuka, Toorak or Peppermint Grove, but Port Hedland&mdash;an industrial town located 1,000 miles north of Perth, surrounded by endless millions of hectares of empty land which cannot be subdivided for housing developments because of the existing processes of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar picture applies in the Shire of Roebourne where massive developments are scheduled in the next five years, including the expansion of the North West Shelf gas project, the establishment of a petrochemical plant and secondary downstream processing of iron ore. These developments, worth billions of dollars, will be held up if land for housing for workers is not available, again, because of the processes of the present Native Title Act. The Shire of Roebourne's principal planner has commented that, `if the land does not become available and prices remained as high, it would be hard to convince companies not to have fly&hyphen;in fly&hyphen;out operations'. `Fly&hyphen;in fly&hyphen;out' benefits no-one in the long run, and adds nothing to regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in Karratha, native title issues in the town of Broome are having a dramatic impact on residential land availability. As demand is far exceeding supply, prices for existing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> housing have increased exponentially. Broome has enormous potential as a tourist resort, and there is an enormous demand from developers for land both for residential purposes and tourist facilities. But, again, due to the processes of the 1993 Native Title Act, no land can be released for these purposes which, in turn, means that no building is occurring and no new jobs are being created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a little about regional development and native title in the north of Western Australia. There are over 40 native title claims in the Kimberley, with some of the claims extending offshore. Not surprisingly, none of these claims has been determined due to the failure of the processes of the present act. But, until these claims are determined, no development can occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Kununurra, there have been no new land releases made in the town or surrounding areas since the introduction of the Native Title Act in 1993 other than a single farming block&mdash;and that resulted in extensive litigation. A major residential subdivision involving 200 lots has been delayed due to the impact of native title. In addition, 22 light industrial lots, 10 horticultural lots, a commercial centre and a tourism site have not been able to go ahead due to the processes of the existing Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The progress of the Ord River development stage 2 has also been hindered by delays due to native title claims. The expansion of the Ord River project, which will provide for an additional 65,000 hectares of land in the north of Western Australia extending into the Northern Territory, has been subject to three native title applications over the proposed expansion area; and the prospect of proceeding through the formal native title process looms as the biggest deterrent for a successful outcome for this development. Native title will unquestionably significantly affect whether or not this project progresses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the pastoral industry, which has been the traditional industry of the north west, with the great cattle and sheep stations of the Kimberley, Pilbara and Gascoyne generating much wealth for this country. But, as is well known, the Native Title Act and the Wik decision have brought great uncertainty 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9599"> to the pastoral industry. It is clear that the Keating government believed that native title would not exist on pastoral leases. As recently as 18 November 1997, Graham Richardson, who formerly held sway in this house, made the concession that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating and his cabinet firmly believed that no native title existed on pastoral leases and were confident that the legislation they finally agreed to would give force to that view.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How wrong the High Court proved them to be!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments before the Senate today will provide a basis for protecting the legitimate interests of the pastoralists while not denying the rights of genuine traditional Aboriginals of access to land for traditional purposes. While the points I have made are very important, there is an even more important reason to make the Native Title Act workable, which is the objective of these amendments. That more important reason is the need to preserve good relationships between the indigenous people of our country and other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this as someone who has lived in the Pilbara since 1974. In that time I have taken a great interest in issues affecting the Aboriginal population of the north west. I have attended Aboriginal bush meetings which were called by Aboriginal communities to discuss issues affecting the Aboriginal people of the north. I must say that one message which came out of those bush meetings time and time again was the view that the question of land rights was much less important than improved housing, health and educational services to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the uncertainties of the present Native Title Act are poisoning relationships between the races, and for the good of all Australians that situation must end. From the Aboriginal point of view, there is a need for reason and equity. It is now generally accepted that the concept of terra nullius was not valid: there were Aboriginal communities in Australia for thousands of years prior to white settlement and these Aboriginal communities or family groups had an affinity to their traditional lands. That was what the High Court recognised in the Mabo decision. There 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is not any doubt in my mind, however, that the problems we now face have been generated by the hastily drafted and poorly written Keating government Native Title Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally have no problem with the concept of genuine traditional owners having rights of access to land for traditional purposes or for such genuine&mdash;and I emphasise the word `genuine'&mdash;traditional owners receiving compensation or royalties from the use of land. In fact, I would rather have Aboriginal communities generating wealth for themselves from such payments than living on government handouts. I know many Aboriginals agree with my point of view and believe that the welfare mentality which pervades Aboriginal affairs must also end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of many Australians, while native title was conceived as a matter of idealism and higher principle, in practice all too often it has degenerated into an unseemly grab for money. The cynicism which exists in the general community about native title claims has arisen from knowledge of the numbers of spurious claims which have been made and the fact that large amounts of money have been repeatedly paid to buy off such claims. The fact that the details of such deals are often secret due to confidentiality clauses only adds to the cynicism which exists in the general community about such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this atmosphere there is a need for a new start to be made to the whole issue of native title claims. I believe this legislation will provide that new start. There is a need for respect for the rights of both sides. Again, this legislation will provide the basis for that respect. In conclusion, I urge my senatorial colleagues from all parties to support this legislation because it provides justice and equity for all concerned, and that surely is an outcome which we all want to achieve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to follow my Western Australian colleague Senator Eggleston in this debate and to perhaps correct some of the comments that he made. I regret that Senator Lightfoot, whom I will also be mentioning in my contribution, is not in the chamber. I have alerted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9600"> him to the fact that in my contribution to the debate I will be mentioning his comments the other night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must draw a contrast between the debate now and the debate that concluded on Tuesday evening when the galleries in this place were full of interested people. Since that happened, the government removed the Native Title Amendment Bill from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, and no debate on this bill occurred in this place yesterday. The debate was interrupted by the government. The government have done that for their own ends, and they are the ones who can respond to it. The public are not in the galleries now, but I know that the public are interested in the debate. I would suggest that the majority of the public are not supportive of what the government is seeking to do in this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the public in Western Australia are listening to the debate, although I doubt very much if many of them are tuned in fully because it is only 7 a.m. over there. They might be listening to the debate in Broome and they might have heard Senator Eggleston's words that Broome has stagnated because of native title. Nothing could be further from the truth. Broome is thriving. There are buildings going up, and I will not say all over the place, but certainly an enormous amount of construction and development is taking place in that town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not seek to put on the record why Senator Eggleston should seek to mislead the House and the people of Australia in the manner that he did. Senator Eggleston's contribution mentioned the shortage of housing in Port Hedland. Indeed, there is a shortage of housing in Port Hedland because there is a massive iron smelting development taking place in the town. That is not the first time that such a shortage has occurred in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and it will not be the last, because any time that you get thousands of workers coming to a centre, there will be a shortage and there has been a shortage in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 1993, before the Native Title Act came into being and when Senator Eggleston was a member of the Port Hedland Shire Council, there were shortages then and diffi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> culties in getting caravan accommodation and vacant blocks for construction. Indeed, there were shortages just down the road in the Shire of Roebourne when the North West Shelf gas development was taking place. I seek to predict that, if the Oakajee project goes ahead in Geraldton in Western Australia, there will also be shortages. The fact that it might rain one day does not mean that the Aboriginal people of Australia are causing this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn very briefly to the comments made the other evening by Senator Lightfoot. There are a number of things in Senator Lightfoot's comments that I can agree with, such as the contribution that the mineral sector has made to the economy of Western Australia. The mineral sector spans the globe in terms of what comes out of Western Australia. That contribution has been magnificent and it is ongoing. I am very pleased that Western Australia can contribute in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But unfortunately there are a few other comments made by Senator Lightfoot that I cannot agree with. He mentioned that this bill is an important bill. Certainly, it may be the most important bill for him. I am not so sure that that is the case for me when debating it, because I had the opportunity in 1993 to take part in the debate on the original native title bill which later became an act. I voted on its passage in this place and it turned out that that was an important bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Western Australian I was ashamed of what happened following the passage of that bill. The government of Western Australia, the state that I represent in this place, challenged the validity of that act of parliament in the High Court of Australia. Do I need to say that that was a coalition government? It was a coalition of the Liberal and National parties of Australia. They thought and argued in the High Court of Australia that the Native Title Act was not constitutional and should have been struck out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the parliament of Western Australia passed the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 which purported to extinguish any surviving native title in Western Australia and replace it with more limited statutory rights to usage of land&mdash;clearly a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9601"> very racist act of parliament when it was finally passed. It was said at the time during the debate in the two chambers of the Western Australian parliament that, indeed what the Western Australian government was seeking to do at that point in time was engaging in an act of racism in this country. Many people, including the churches, condemned the Western Australian government for doing that at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History records that the High Court upheld the validity of the Commonwealth Native Title Act, dismissed the Western Australian challenge to that act and then held that the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993&mdash;the Western Australian act&mdash;was inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act 1995 and was therefore inoperative because of section 109 of constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliaments of Australia can indeed pass acts of parliament that are racist and, if the government has its way on this one, we in the Commonwealth might repeating that same error. I certainly do not want to have a part of it. Ultimately, the High Court of Australia will determine whether or not what is passed in this place in the next week or two is or is not inconsistent with the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act, which has been on our statute books for quite a number of years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What lends me to believe that this is in fact a racist act of parliament? I am encouraged in that viewpoint by the fact that the government, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) will not release the information and the advice that it has received from its senior legal advisers, which we understand is telling the government that this bill is inconsistent with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also encouraged to form the view that this bill is in fact racist by the comments made by the person who is currently the Acting Prime Minister of Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, who said about the 10&hyphen;point plan some months ago that it: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . represents a winding back from an extremist, unpractical decision of the High Court . . . there are bucketfuls of extinguishment in the 10&hyphen;point plan.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is the case, and I think it is the case, the High Court in adjudicating on this matter&mdash;and inevitably it will be called on to adjudicate&mdash;will rule, as the majority of the legal advice that is around has told the parliament through the various committee processes, that the bill that is before the parliament will not stand up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some comments by Senator Eggleston and by my other Western Australian colleague Senator Lightfoot. Senator Lightfoot described the current Native Title Act and its operation as `the dead hand of native title'. There is no question about it: there are some difficulties with the act as it currently operates. The previous government had it in mind to make some amendments to the act but unfortunately, as the election got in the way, the new government was required to address that. They had developed a plan of amendment to the act to make it more real to the circumstances of life. The original bill was amended in its passage through the Senate and some of those amendments had unforeseen consequences. So there was always an expectation that the bill was going to be amended somehow, in some way. The Wik decision made it inevitable that the act would be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if the act as it was applied was a dead hand, it would have stopped everything. The mineral industry, from which my state of Western Australia benefits so much, as does the economy of Australia, both in exploration terms and in mining terms, would have caved in, would have fallen over, would have ceased to exist. That is not the case. If one looks at the statistics on investment in the mineral industry we find that, rather than winding back the amount of money that is spent on exploration in Western Australia, the amounts are increasing. If they are increasing, how can a dead hand be operating?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for actual and expected private mineral exploration in the June quarter of 1997 tell us that the figure for Western Australia has increased from $11.9 million to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9602"> $188.2 million. Ninety-five per cent of the mineral exploration activities in Western Australia have invoked the right to negotiate procedures under the Native Title Act. Senator Lightfoot referred to the amount of money that has been spent by the minerals industry in exploration off&hyphen;shore. I was of the view that the previous government, and indeed the current government, were encouraging Australian companies to invest off&hyphen;shore for their own benefit, for the benefit of their shareholders and also for the benefit of Australians. Both governments, as I understand it, have encouraged that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on a practical level, has the Native Title Act&mdash;which does need amendment, as everybody agrees&mdash;stopped development in this country? Has it laid a dead hand on the continual growth of our economy? In my state of Western Australia the Kimberley Land Council, as Senator Eggleston and, I am certain, Senator Lightfoot would be aware, has been able to negotiate over 30 agreements on behalf of native title holders covering matters such as cultural protection, mining and exploration, tourism, agriculture, and major capital works. If you want to see some of the major capital works you do not have to travel very far from the airport in Broome. If you come in over the town to land at the airport you will have one of the major developments on your right hand side just by the airport and the other one on the left hand side. They are there, starkly in front of you. That has happened in a very short period. It has happened by a process of negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for other parts of Australia, we have heard a lot about the Hopevale agreement in Queensland, an agreement between nine parties in northern Queensland which covers a wide range of interests and shows that, with goodwill and effort by all parties, even complex native title claims can be resolved through mediation. The agreement is between the Queensland government, Telstra, the Australian Maritime Authority, the Cook Shire Council, the Queensland Commercial Fisheries Organisation, Cape Flattery Silicone Mine, the Far North Queensland Electricity Corporation, Cape York Land Council and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hopevale Aboriginal Council. It can happen. Not only can it happen; it is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those with a particular view want to cover their eyes to this. Those who want to take away some of the very minimum and basic rights that our native people of Australia, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, do not want to see this and do not want to recognise this, but they will be forced to do so because, like it or not, even if this bill passes and however it is amended on its way through the parliament, it will end up in the High Court. I have great confidence that the High Court of Australia will uphold and stand by the rights of the Aboriginal people of this country. And there will be many more of us. Senator Lightfoot said the other night in his contribution how proud he was to be an Australian. I can say the same thing, although I speak with a different tongue. I am a migrant to this country, like Sir Peter Abeles, whose picture appeared in an advertisement in all the major newspapers of Australia last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Abeles has a point of view to put across. He has money in order to do so. He has an objective with that. I have a point of view to put across on behalf of my constituents in Western Australia, and I am doing that here. I have an obligation to do that. Part of that obligation is summed up in the following quotation, which the minority members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee put into the report on the constitutionality of the bill that is currently before the Senate. Peter Wertheim, from the Jewish Board of Deputies, when speaking on the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  on 5 November this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't want my children or grandchildren to have to get up in public in 50 years' time and apologies for my silence. There has already been far too much silence during this century. Genocide has had far too easy a run. And I could at least speak for the Jewish community when I say that we will not be mute, we will not maintain a criminal silence in the face of continuing attempts of genocide against indigenous Australia, even if it is genocide by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I commend Mr Wertheim for these views. I commend the leaders of the major churches in this country for expressing the views they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9603"> have expressed in opposition to the government's plans as expressed in the 10-point plan and in this bill before the parliament. I condemn those who criticise the churches for putting forward those views. In particular, I condemn the statements by Mr Entsch, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Native Title, calling for a boycott of the churches because some church leaders spoke out in opposition to what the government are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while ending with Mr Entsch. It should be recalled by each and every one of us involved in this debate that Mr Warren Entsch, the chairman of that committee, was in fact hand picked by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to chair that committee. It was not something that happened by accident. That decision for Mr Entsch to chair that committee&mdash;and in doing so espousing the views that he does espouse&mdash;is the decision of the Prime Minister. So, when he speaks for a boycott, he speaks on behalf of his party, his Prime Minister and his government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, rise to speak on the legislation before us now&mdash;commonly called the Wik legislation, but actually the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . At the outset of my contribution I wish to make it absolutely clear that my advice, and I believe it, is that this bill is not racist; it does not breach the Racial Discrimination Act. I have taken private advice on this myself because it was an issue that concerned me. So that is the first point I wish to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that I wish to make is that there are fundamentally two reasons why we are here debating the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . The first one, and what it is mostly about, is the fatally flawed Keating legislation of 1993 which has proved to be unworkable. I will deal with that in some detail later in my contribution. The second reason is the Wik decision, but that is a fairly small part of the total amendments proposed to the 1993 legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had there not been a Wik decision, or had the decision been brought down confirming valid leases extinguished native title on pastoral leases, we would have been still here 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debating virtually the total substance of what we have before us now. People on the other side, including the Democrats and the minor parties, should remember that. Always remember that the decision on Wik was a four-three decision. It could easily have gone the other way. It was not clear cut. Never forget that those on the other side passed their legislation believing that native title had been extinguished on pastoral leases, and that includes the Democrats and the performance they put in on that unforgettable night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this legislation so important to Western Australia, the state that I come from? It is pretty fundamentally clear to those who live over there. But many people do not understand the Western Australian situation. They do not understand the level of crown land in WA. It is almost the total of crown land which exists in Australia&mdash;not quite; there are some other places where there is some crown land, but close to 40 per cent of land is crown land in our state. I think we have 44 per cent, to be precise, under pastoral lease and we have a variety of other titles&mdash;for example, freehold and perpetual leases&mdash;over the remainder. In total, the freehold title in WA is about eight per cent. So the impact of the original Mabo decision was very much greater on Western Australia than it was on the other states; hence there was a different response from many of those people who live in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visit many Aboriginal communities. During all my primary school days, except for one year, there were more Aboriginal children at the school than there were Europeans. I developed a very close personal affiliation with them, and I still have many friends from those days. The vast majority of people in the communities hate native title. They hate what it has done to their communities. They hate the fight and the vilification that is occurring between communities. They hate the multiple claims, mounting up to 20 in some instances. In most instances it is five or six.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at Wongutha just last week. I had the privilege, on behalf of Senator Ellison, of opening a school building. The principal speaker made it quite clear in his opening address to me&mdash;and they asked me to take 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9604"> this back to the parliament of this country&mdash;that they wanted a fully developed commercial title that they could use, they could grow on, they could bring their families up on, they could trade, they could borrow money on and that they could do all the things that everybody else does under their title in Australia. Native title does not give them that, and they spelt that out very clearly. I have heard that story time and again. It is something that I believe this parliament needs to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently in Western Australia 43 pastoral leases&mdash;that was on my last count; there could be more now&mdash;are owned and operated by Aboriginal people just the same as anybody else. That is over 10 per cent of the total pastoral leases in Western Australia. That program, which I am proud to say I was involved in, was put in place when Brian Burke was the Premier of Western Australia, and it has been very successful. It is the direction in which we should be going, in my view, in terms of land ownership by our indigenous cousins or friends in this nation of ours. It has worked well, it is enjoyed by the people involved in it and it is very successful. People from those properties come to Canberra from time to time and I have the opportunity of talking to them, which I enjoy doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to touch on one or two other things before I get into some specifics. What has galled me most in this debate is some of the racist comments that have been delivered. Racist comments are the oldest trick in the book, and they are also the dirtiest card in the pack. It is almost impossible for people to defend themselves when a racist slur is made against them because they are in a totally unwinnable position. Making those comments&mdash;we all know what they are&mdash;does not do any good for this debate or anybody. In my view, it damages the cause very seriously and it is very irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to talk about some of the issues which I think are important to my state, what I call `irresponsible actions' that have occurred and some of the matters addressed in this bill which were flaws in the previous legislation, the 1993 legislation. I refer to the irresponsible, not thought out multiple claims that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been put over a number of mining leases, over a number of waters, over some freehold land, over perpetual lease land&mdash;claims that have no hope in the world, in my view, of getting up. They have caused division. They have increased hatred, particularly in some of our pastoral areas but also in the south&hyphen;west of the state, where there were good relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a meeting in Mount Barker, where claims have been put over perpetual and conditional purpose leases which had been granted. One of the things that this legislation will do is address a flaw in the previous legislation. It will identify where valid land titles have been granted with exclusive possession. If exclusive possession is not granted, they are not covered. I include in those, for example, the pastoral leases in Western Australia and the western division leases in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the previous government, the Labor government, made it quite clear that they believed native title had been extinguished in both those areas. We are not extinguishing native title on those because exclusive possession was not granted. People who suggest otherwise are being dishonest, and that is very sad. They might wish to criticise the fact that we are confirming the situation on title where exclusive possession has been granted but it is absolutely and totally not true to say that we are extinguishing native title in those other areas. That is very unfortunate because it clouds the good things that can come out of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me touch on why we in Western Australia feel very strongly about making this piece of legislation work and address some of the issues for the benefit of all Australians. First of all, 82 per cent of my state is currently under claim. That has meant that many land holders with freehold and exclusive titles are being forced to defend their titles in the Federal Court as well as incurring significant costs in being away from their farms, their businesses, to attend mediation conferences, knowing full well that at the end of the day there is little likelihood of anything coming out of them other than division and dislike of one another.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9605">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I deal with some aspects of the mining industry. I note Senator McKiernan's comments. One can use statistics to put up any argument. I do not argue with what he said, but I do argue with his conclusions. The impact has been significant, and that comes about fundamentally because of the right to negotiate simply by lodging a claim. The claims can be totally bogus but they still result in delays of up to 12 months but more likely in practice two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree with Senator McKiernan when he said that it is important that we have investment offshore, but I disagree very strongly with that investment being forced offshore because mining companies cannot get access here to explorations licences or mining licences or have delays of up to 12 months, two years or beyond. Forcing investment offshore in that way is bad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make is that virtually all claimants demand large cash payments. Some claim a share of future profits while others demand large cash payments before they will even attend a negotiating meeting. Again, I must stress that these are individuals or groups who have simply lodged a claim with no requirement to establish a prima facie case or pass any form of registration test. That was a flaw in the previous legislation that we will address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an example of where this occurred. This example did not occur in mining but a CBH, cooperative bulk handling, bin in a place called Borden in Western Australia in the middle of the wheat belt where it was necessary to increase the size of the grain bin. It was necessary, under the regimes that apply, for notification to be given as to whether it was open to claim. Before the individuals who made that particular claim would even go and negotiate at the site they demanded an up-front cash payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what native title is about. It is not what the response to the Mabo decision should be. It is not even what any response should be with regard to Wik. I put that on the record as an example of the misuse of the right to negotiate. You can run through a significant number of those sorts of examples. Having said that, I am not saying that occurs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in every case, but it occurs in many cases. It has caused confusion and an enormous amount of mistrust&mdash;mistrust that was not there previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the procedures that exist in Western Australia, there are now over 9,000 land titles being delayed by the procedures. There is a backlog of over 7,000 mining titles with 1,900 titles caught in this right to negotiate process. Since March 1995, only 158 leases have been granted as a result of the right to negotiate agreements, but every week a further 14 leases enters the process. That, in my view, is going backwards at a rapid rate and has to be addressed. This legislation addresses that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supporters of the present act claim that the right to negotiate is not a veto. But in the risky business of resource development any ability to delay a project by even 12 months can be the equivalent of a veto or it has the effect of a veto. That is what is occurring on the ground, particularly in my state. When we look at Western Australia it is a lucky state in the sense of the resources it has. Those resources can be used for the benefit of all Australians, particularly Western Australians and Western Australian indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is probably harming the genuine indigenous people who live in the areas more than anyone else. It is costing them jobs and it is costing them the opportunity for training. I put on the public record here and now that a number of our major mining operations, as a matter of policy, have a number of Aboriginal youth on their staff on training courses. Labor Senator McKiernan, who is now in the chair, well knows that. The process we have now is harming that training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate and I put it to this parliament that the substance of this legislation&mdash;and there is much more one could talk about&mdash;is very important to this nation. It is very important to all in this nation whether they have been here 200 years, whether their ancestry goes back 40,000 years or whether they have arrived in the current generation&mdash;as many people who now call themselves Australians have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9606">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the emotion that has been built up, the name calling that has occurred has clouded the real issues with which it deals. I put it to those on the other side, to the Greens and to the Democrats that as they were a very big part of what went wrong with the previous legislation, the 1993 legislation, they now have a responsibility, with us on this side of the chamber, to address the problems that came out of that legislation. If they do not, or if they allow or amend this legislation to a point that it does not address the principle issues outside of the Wik decision, then they will have failed in their responsibility to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly put that to my Western Australian colleagues on the other side of this chamber. We saw yesterday in question time what many of their state colleagues think. We know which way the vast majority of the people who vote for them in the great hinterland of Western Australia, those who returned Labor Party people to the state parliament in the Western Australian, want them to vote. They want them to support this legislation. I make a plea to them to work as hard as they can to make sure we get the substance of this through because it will be to the benefit of us all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This nation is being divided like it has never been divided before. The divisions in this nation though are not divisions between black and white. The divisions which are occurring in this nation are divisions between those who live in the cities and close to the cities and those who live outside the cities, those who live in what we call the bush, the outback, the areas away from all the trappings and enjoyments of civilisation as we know them in the capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that? I say that because the current land law in this country, as a result of the native title claims and cases we have seen, has guaranteed one group of Australians security and safety. One group of Australians are guaranteed the sanctity of their property. They are the people who live in the cities. The other Australians who live outside the cities do not have that same security of title, do not have that same sanctity for their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> property, do not have that assurance that they crave and they deserve and they ought to have. The interesting thing is that quite a few of the people who live outside the capital cities whose titles are at threat from native title are in fact Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that the proponents of native title have never had the honesty to tell this parliament, have never had the honesty to tell the Australian people, is that a number of the defendants in the Wik case were in fact Aboriginal Australians&mdash;Eddie Holroyd, an Aboriginal Australian; Mary Kendal, an Aboriginal Australian; Elaine Price, an Aboriginal Australian. Why are these people defendants in the Wik case? Why were their properties made subject to claim? Was it for the advancement of the Aboriginal people? Or was it for some other purpose? If the Wik claim was about rectifying the wrongs that were done to the Aboriginal people in the past&mdash;there have been many wrongs&mdash;then why did these people have to be made defendants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should Eddie Holroyd, a man who has spent 20 years slogging his guts out on his bit of property, become a defendant if this is about rectifying wrongs done by whites against blacks? The Wik claim in fact is not about that. The Wik claim is about a wider political agenda, and the wider political agenda is to ensure that we undermine the property system of this country. If the Cape York Land Council were genuinely interested in the wellbeing of Aboriginal people, then Eddie Holroyd, Mary Kendal, Elaine Price and others like them would be held up as role models for the Aboriginal people. They would be held up as an inspiration for what can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They should be held up as role models because they have proved that all the popular misconceptions about Aboriginal people are wrong. They have proved that Aboriginal people can achieve on equal terms. They have proved that Aboriginal people can become successful businessmen and successful businesswomen. But, no, these people are not held up as role models. These people have been held up for attack for the simple reason that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9607"> they had the temerity to go out, to have a go and to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the question: is this bill before the parliament a racist bill, as some would have you believe? It is certainly the case that this bill is controversial. But this bill is not a racist bill. Just because a bill is controversial does not mean it is racist. None of the people who have made that slur have ever proven the claim that this is racist legislation. Let me explain why that is so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Racism can have many definitions, but the popularly accepted definition is when a bit of legislation seeks to disadvantage one group of people unfairly for the advantage of another group of people based solely on race. We have already seen that many of the people whose properties are subject to claim are in fact Aboriginal. So, when we rectify those problems, when we validate their title, we are not validating the title of whites at the expense of blacks. We are validating the title of people who have bought pastoral properties in this country, be they black, white or anything else, from a competing claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there will always be people who will say that this legislation is racist. But, if this legislation is racist, then so too are many other things in this country racist. If this bill is racist, so too was the bill of the previous government, which is now legislation. So too is the Native Title Act racist if this bill is racist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was present in this chamber four years ago for the debate. I sat across the aisle from where Senator Quirke sits now, and I heard the government of the day say that the Native Title Bill would validate pastoral leases, would ensure that there were no native title claims over pastoral leases and, in fact, would specifically extinguish native title claim over pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is racist, the Native Title Act is racist. If those of us who sit on this side are racist, then the people who moved the Native Title Bill four years ago are racist as well. But those are the people who are throwing the stones. I can only turn to the Bible and say, `Let he who is without sin throw the first stone.' The legislation which the previous government brought in was always intended 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. That was the intention. That is what Senator Evans told this parliament when he was sitting in that seat in front of me. He told this parliament that the intention of the Native Title Act was to ensure that there would not be native title over pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the Labor Party wants to have a Damascene conversion and say, `No, it is wrong, it is improper, it is immoral to ensure that native title does not exist over pastoral leases.' If it is wrong, improper and immoral now it was wrong, improper and immoral four years ago. But that is not what they were saying. The commitment of those opposite to these so&hyphen;called moral issues is skin&hyphen;deep in many cases. Deep down they know that this legislation gives effect to what they tried to do four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should ask: if this legislation is racist, what of the decision of the High Court of Australia? Is it not racist to create a type of title available to only one group of people? If this legislation is racist, so too is the decision of the High Court of Australia. I do not hear anybody on the other side saying, `The High Court of Australia isn't racist.' If people who disagree with the Wik decision are racist, then so too are three of the justices of the High Court of Australia who disagreed with the Wik decision. So too is Chief Justice Brennan, who disagreed with the Wik decision. If those of us who oppose this bill are racist, then so too are those people.</PARA>

And so it was. In that case, the High Court granted private property rights to two of the successful claimants. It said, `You as individuals own this land, and you always have.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do you know what the previous government did in the Native Title Act? They were very sneaky. They changed that. They stole from indigenous people the right to own the land as individuals and instead inserted a provision that said that where a court made a finding that there was native title, native title must be owned by a corporation. For corporation, read `land council'. They stole away from individual indigenous people the right to own land. They said, `You cannot own this land. The only people who can own native 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> title under the Native Title Act are land corporations.' That does not do anything for the ordinary Aboriginal or Islander.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I argued against this provision four years ago. Over the four intervening years I have maintained a passionate dislike of that provision in the bill, because I believe it is a massive and immoral fraud, aimed at consolidating the power of the land councils at the expense of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on record as saying that it is my view that, where Aboriginal people prove native title over unallocated vacant crown land, they should be given title to that land as freehold land. In the state of Queensland from which I come we have done nothing with these bits of land since 1859. If the white fella has done nothing with it since 1859 I think it is a bit churlish now for us to come back and say, `We are not going to let the black fella own it as freehold title.' That is what I stand for and believe in and that is what is denied to those people in the Native Title Act and was denied to them by the Labor Party when they were in government. It is what is denied to them now by the Labor Party, which continues to argue that the only people who should own Native Title are land councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there are many Aboriginal people in Queensland who share my view. They want to own a bit of land for themselves. They want to have the opportunity to own a bit of land, be it a house in an Aboriginal community or a grazing property, and they want the opportunity to hand that land on to their children and grandchildren. But, if it is native title land, that is not possible. It is not possible, because of the legislation put through by the previous government. And shame on them for doing it, shame on them indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can see that there are many different and conflicting viewpoints in relation to native title, and the morality does not sit on the opposite side of the chamber. There are some people on the other side of the chamber who I respect very much. Some of them are in the chamber right now. They are very honourable, moral and decent people. But I can say one thing: the stance of the Labor Party on native title has been immoral, dis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9609"> honest and unreasonable. And they maintain that dishonest, immoral and unreasonable stance in the amendments they have brought forward and in their opposition to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have said in the past that this bill is not necessary. They have said, `We don't need this bill.' Their former leader, Mr Keating said, `We don't need this bill.' Let me tell you what will happen if we do not have this bill and do not fix the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people in western Queensland have said to me that they want this bill. They want it because the divisions which have occurred as a result of native title claims are ripping their communities apart. I will quote from some of the claims that have been made over western Queensland. There is a fiction out there that all these native title claims are about sharing the land and coexistence. I will quote from claim C00387, lodged in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claim C00387 is made by the Miawali and Karuwali peoples and is over large areas of the Diamantina shire council. The claim says that the Miawali and Karuwali peoples claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the right to possession of the Land, Waters, resources and attributes of the Land and Waters . . . . (iv) the right to manage the Land, Water and resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And they seek a declaration which is not for coexistence but which says that native title exists in relation to the whole of the lands and waters covered by the application. Further they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Applicants claim the native title rights as exclusive to themselves, and further&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">they claim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a right to exclude from the areas under claim, all except members of the claimant peoples.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not a claim for coexistence, this is not a claim for sharing. This is a claim for exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read you another one, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is a claim from the Kullilli people over an area of south&hyphen;west Queensland in the Bulloo shire, the Murweh shire the Paroo shire and the Quilpie shire. The claim says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kullilli people claim to be entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enjoyment of the claimed land (including subterranean land and burial grounds) and waterholes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These claims are outrageous. Under common law nobody can own the water; yet these claims seek the water. In the state of Queensland nobody can own the minerals in the ground; yet these claims seek to own the minerals in the ground. Under common law that has never been possible. That has never been a common law right. These are not claims for common law but for something more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you how the people out there who have leases that are under claim feel about a claim for exclusive possession. They say, `This is a threat to us' and, of course, they have got to defend it. You would be mad not to defend this. You have got to understand that under section 70 of the Native Title Act, if you do not defend a claim which is made against you, the court can make an order for native title in the terms sought by the applicant without further reference to you. These claims encourage division. These claims require division because they put people's properties at risk and because they make their properties subject to claims for exclusive possession as against the whole world. That is divisive. That will rip communities apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is another way. That is the way put forward in this bill because it says, `Look, in relation to lands which have exclusive tenure, there will be no native title.' That is what was always intended by those opposite. That is what we are going to give effect to now and that was, in fact, the intention of six of our High Court judges in the original decision in Mabo No. 2. We give effect to that. So we confirm leases which grant exclusive possession&mdash;miners' homestead leases, grazing homestead perpetual leases, grazing homestead freeholding leases and so on in the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We clarify the situation in relation to towns and sporting facilities and infrastructure. We say you can make a claim for native title but it is a claim for compensation only. For example, in relation to sporting grounds, we say these facilities exist for the benefit of everybody in the community. I fought pas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9610"> sionately to have this provision inserted in the bill and I stand here to defend it before you today. I say that, where a facility is available&mdash;be it a showground, a footy field or whatever&mdash;for every member of that community, it is wrong, unjust, unfair and divisive to say that that land should be made subject to a native title claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will allow a claim to go ahead but it will be a claim for compensation, and the Aboriginal people, if they can prove that claim, will get their constitutional and just rights under section 51 of the constitution&mdash;and I would have nothing less than their constitutional and just rights. I have ensured they will get their constitutional and just right. But they should not have a right to hold the rest of the people in that community to ransom when that facility is provided for everybody in that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went to test what response this bill would have from people who are in the grazing fraternity. I travelled out to the Gulf of Carpentaria to see my friends in the Carpentaria branch of the cattlemen's union. They sat down with me and we spent all day at Hell's Gate. They said, `We would just like native title extinguished over all pastoral leases,' and I said, `I can understand that. That is a consistent and sensible vie. But that is not what the government is giving you. Let's talk about what is on here.' At the end of the day Ernie Camp said something to me that I will always remember. He said, `Bill, extinguishment is what we want and we will always want it. But it is probably not what we need. What we need is certainty and a framework in which we can work together&mdash;and that's what you give us. Go down to Canberra and get this bill passed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know why he said that? Ernie Camp said that to me in the knowledge that this bill would still allow a native title claim over his land but the claim would be subject to a threshold test, which basically requires people to prove that they have had a regular physical access to the land. He said, `If they have had a regular physical access to the land, it is because I have let them and I don't have any problem with sitting down with those people.' That is what this bill does. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not what the propagandists on the other side would have you believe, but that is what this bill does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude where I started. This legislation is necessary to prevent this country being ripped apart. Isn't it interesting that the people who live in the cities, where the Aborigines were shot, poisoned, murdered and moved out a long time ago and the land made subject to freehold claims, now want the rest of Australia to carry their sins and their burdens? I do not think that is fair, I do not think it is just and I do not think it is reasonable. There are people who say they will weep if this bill gets passed; I say I will weep if this bill does not get passed. This bill needs to get passed to ensure that we have one united and harmonious country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee finished off his speech by saying he is going to weep if the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  does not go through. In about a week's time we might take him up on that. We will see how it goes. I suggest he turn it into a fundraiser because a number of us on this side would pay a good quid to see that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to spend a lot of time on Senator O'Chee's impassioned speech on this because he has got his particular wheelbarrow to push and, obviously, before the morning is out, his staff will be sending to all of his relevant constituents in Queensland a copy of his speech and the remarks that he has made. But there are a couple of bits of his speech that really need to be teased out to see, in fact, what is behind them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spent a fair bit of the last part of his speech on the question of certainty. The one thing that is certain about this whole process is that it is not going to finish here today, it is not going to finish here next week and, if we do come back the week after that, it is not going to finish then either. In fact, this particular exercise is probably going to give rise to more certainty amongst the lawyers in our fraternity more than amongst pastoralists, land&hyphen;holders and traditional Aboriginal owners of particular parts of Australia. I think the one certainty about this is that, within a few years, we will be back here again because the High 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9611"> Court will have found something else, whether it be in Mabo or in this legislation, which will require further scrutiny and further attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point made by Senator O'Chee was that there are a large number of Aboriginals in Queensland who would just like to own a piece of land underneath them. I take his point that they do not want corporate ownership of the land. What they want is distinct individual title which, I quite openly tell the Senate, is what I have over the house in which I live. I can understand that. But I think the problem with that&mdash;and I am not an educated man in Aboriginal culture and history&mdash;is that it presupposes a European concept of property ownership where one largely does not exist. I say largely does not exist because I have not seen a lot of concepts of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The individual property ownership that most of us in this place are accustomed to is a European concept. It is one that, in many respects, has been imposed on Australians and I suspect that the proposition that Senator O'Chee was putting to us here is that quite a number of his Aboriginal constituents whom he spoke to on this particular matter are really, deep down, Europeans underneath a dark skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that that whole problem he raises is one which needs much more subtlety than has come out in the debate so far. The Aboriginal communities in Australia have had a couple of hundred years of co&hyphen;existing with an alien culture. I use the word `co-existing' despite the fact&mdash;certainly Senator O'Chee made this point&mdash;that in some areas the Aboriginals, by one means or another, were totally driven out of those communities or killed. That did happen. There were other schemes, some as recently as 25 or 30 years ago, which were implemented to try to Europeanise all Aboriginal children in this society. This year we have heard the debate in this place and elsewhere about the stolen generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But deep down the concept that Senator O'Chee was putting forward as one of his principal arguments against the concept of native title as it emerged from the Mabo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision and legislation is still based predominantly on a European view of what land titling is all about. He may explain that further; he may say that I am being unfair to him. He may say that I do not understand the particular problems of Queensland. I want to come to that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the debate here this morning has been concerned with Queensland and Western Australia, where this is a much more burning issue than it is in the state from which I come. That is not to say that my constituents in South Australia are at all disinterested in this debate&mdash;they are not. They are very interested in this debate but they come at it from a very different perspective. For 200 years, until the late 1980s and early 1990s, various members of the judiciary in this country have denied the existence of Aboriginal occupation of Australia because it was an easy way to deal with a number of problems. There is no easy way in these debates. Although that has happened, many communities in Australia have recognised either the co&hyphen;existence or the continued existence of Aboriginal communities in their midst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia that has certainly been the record. I cannot tell the Senate that it has been a brilliant record in all sorts of other ways. For instance, I remember the kids at my primary school who were taken forcibly from their parents, both white and black, but predominantly black, and placed in orphanages or foster homes. I am old enough&mdash;Senator O'Chee probably is not&mdash;to remember those days. In my grade 2 and 3 years I well remember these kids who looked so miserable and who were treated so poorly. That has come out this year and any government in Australia that has not taken some responsibility for those particular years ought to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other respects, the record is not quite as bad. Certainly in South Australia there are provisions in pastoral leases dating back to 1856. In fact, self-government in a representative fashion started in South Australia in 1856. One of the first things that happened was that all pastoral leases recognised Aboriginal occupancy of the land. Those pastoral leases today have clearly written provisions which guarantee certain native title rights. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9612"> right to trespass on the land, the right of ceremony, the right to hunt and fish and various other rights have been a legal feature of pastoral leases in South Australia for 130 years or so. Whilst many pastoralists in South Australia would like these rights extinguished, they accept them much more than is the case in the two&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;outlying states of Queensland and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that Western Australia has a few specific problems because the full impact of Mabo was on crown land. We can have an argument here about the impact on pastoral leases of the original native title bill that went through this place some years ago, but my understanding is that the principal impact of the original Mabo propositions and the bill that went through here was that crown land was an empty and an open question. Western Australia has the highest percentage of vacant crown land in the country. In Queensland there are all sorts of other problems, and I suspect that the record up there has not been as good in trying to come even remotely around to the concept of co&hyphen;existence that is present in the other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee and a few others have made comments about the safety and the sanctuary of metropolitan areas. I suspect that, at least in part, some of what he is saying is correct. Indeed, the High Court seems to have said in a seven&hyphen;nil decision that there is no argument that freehold title does extinguish native title in Australia. That may be wrong but my understanding of it is that the argument is now about pastoral leases and crown land; it is not at all about freehold title land. I have more to say about that in just a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that it gives Senator O'Chee and a few of the others some comfort that they can say that people like me who come from a metropolitan area really ought not get involved in this debate because rural people are the only ones who need to worry about these particular considerations, and that what we need to do is to go down the road of extinguishing the rights of Aboriginals in many other parts of Australia simply because we already have them in the metropolitan areas of Australia. But I think there is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> different way forward on this, and I suspect that, even in the dark days when courts were saying things as if the Aboriginal race did not exist in Australia, just was not here at all, communities like the one that I live in in South Australia were taking a different and more humane view of that particular concept. What they were saying was that they were recognising, at least in the pastoral leases, that there were prior claims to these lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that this legislation before us today has a few propositions within it which are not going to survive here in the Senate. One of those propositions is the one which would lead to what the Leader of the National Party in Australia has described as bucketloads of extinguishment of native title. I imagine that the way this process will devolve if this bill goes through here is that we will have the situation where persons in ownership of pastoral leases will then be able to make application through the various state authorities to have those leases upgraded, at their own expense, to freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that at the core of this legislation there is a mechanism by which there can be a wholesale extinguishment of Aboriginal rights and entitlements, to generate freehold land on large parts of pastoral Australia&mdash;provided, of course, that the pastoralists wish to go down that road, and I am sure some of them do, and provided the relevant state governments are going to authorise that particular activity. I have no doubt that there are some state governments that will go down that road as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure what the attitude is going to be in South Australia on this question. I would not be at all surprised if the government there did not see this as a way of doing what they have tried to do several other times in office, and that is to grant full title to a number of pastoralists in South Australia. I have no doubt that that will happen in Western Australia and Queensland and maybe other places as well. There are two problems with that. We do not have time today to go into all the implications of that, but I am not so sure that to upgrade large tracts of Australia to freehold title is necessarily in the interests of the community of Australia in general.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9613">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is taking us away from this debate now, and I will not do that for very long, because this is a very important debate. But I just want to give that warning, that I am not so sure that this particular process, which could lead to very large tracts of Australia being upgraded from leasehold, with all the implications that has, to freehold title, is necessarily in the interests of the Australian community in the long run. Certainly it is not going to be in the interests of those Aboriginal groups who have traditionally had some affiliation with a particular piece of land to have it ripped from underneath them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the debate that is going to go on here for the next week or two is a very long one which is enormously complicated. I guess it is the role of senators to give advice to various people. One of the people I want to give advice to is the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He may not welcome it, he may not even read it, he may not see it as relevant, but anyone who has got a 10&hyphen;point plan ought to be worried, because most people do not bother reading past point 1 or point 2. His 10&hyphen;point plan is an enormously complicated piece of written material which really does not cast a lot of light on what is an enormously complex process that is unfolding here in the Senate chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of members of my community, however, who have had a look at this particular legislation and have tried to make sense out of it. In fact, most of the surveys that have been done show that there are only a few per cent of people out there&mdash;I think about four per cent&mdash;who really have understood what the Prime Minister is about with this piece of legislation that has come before the Senate. I have received a number of letters on this legislation, more than on anything else in the 2&half; months I have been here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of people out there who are following this process and I want to give some recognition today to some of the people who have taken the trouble to write to me. They have not sent in a piece of typewritten material with a signature at the bottom that has come from some organisation or other&mdash;not that I am downplaying the role of those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> organisations; I am not. I want to give recognition first and foremost to those people who have taken the trouble to actually write a letter to me, and I presume to other senators. One I will share with the Senate is under the hand of Gina Manno, from Sturt Street in Adelaide. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge you to vote that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) there is no extinguishment of Native Title;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Aboriginal people must be given the right to negotiate;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) there is no undermining of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I received another letter from a constituent, Margaret Davies, who writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to voice my concern over the Government's proposals to amend the Native Title Act. Like many Australians I believe the amendments are racially discriminatory. Racist policies and laws are no longer tolerable in this country, and it is absolutely outrageous that the Government should be proposing such measures.

It downgrades the legal entitlements of Aboriginal people, by reducing and in some cases eliminating the right to negotiate, leaving the interests of other parties intact.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter goes on in a similar vein to urge that we, as senators from South Australia, reject the government bill. I have a letter here from the Adelaide Justice Coalition, which says much the same sorts of things. Again, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is so wrong that the possible threat of a double dissolution should not be used as justification for allowing it to pass. We urge you to exercise your integrity . . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the release of this bill, the press has deliberately exploited the highly emotive words used at times quite recklessly by the Labor Party, some Aboriginal leaders, church leaders, and a variety of individuals. They have branded the government and, thereby, its members as racist; they claim that the government is legislating for total extinguishment of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To claim that the government and, thereby, its members are racist is just a disgusting and racist claim of itself. The one common denominator with virtually all of these people who have made these statements&mdash;and I have many letters like the ones Senator Quirke has just read out&mdash;is that they have not read the bill. How wrong can this play of petty politics get, whilst being aided and abetted by a media who, from my direct questions to journalists, have not read the bill either? I have yet to come across one journalist who has been able to acknowledge to me that he or she has read the bill. The claims they have made imply that they have&mdash;but, when asked directly, no, they have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives greater, not lesser, protection to native title than the common law; and there is no new provision in it to upgrade pastoral leases. The bill actually ensures that future government grants of additional rights to pastoral leaseholders cannot extinguish any native title&mdash;cannot extinguish the existence of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where was the media in 1993, when Noel Pearson accused the failed Keating government of being composed of `moral scurvy', and Mick Dodson described the original acts as `the latter day equivalent of guns and strychnine'? The media remained silent, although it was able to catch some great footage of the then Senator Gareth Evans and his now great friend Cheryl Kernot, doing a jig and embracing in joy in this very chamber&mdash;but a joy, it must be remembered, which was based on the understanding by the then Labor government that pastoral leases extinguished native title. Gareth Evans said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9615">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is overwhelmingly likely that when this comes to be formally decided the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases do in fact extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were former Senator Gareth Evans' words, not mine. That joy was certainly short lived. The premise of the Labor Party's extinguishment was short lived. It is only now that we are beginning to understand the full impact of the mess they have left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issue of extinguishment. This government is not seeking to extinguish native title. Of all those who claim that this bill does that, not one person has been able to point to a clause in the bill which effects it. The bill respects the common law rights of indigenous Australians and merely seeks to confirm what the High Court has said. I keep asking those opposed to this bill to direct me to the clauses which extinguish native title. They cannot. It is quite the reverse, in fact. This legislation we are debating is premised on the common law right of native title and recognises, respects and preserves both the Mabo and the Wik decisions of the High Court. It does not seek to overturn any of the developments of recent years; it merely seeks to confirm those rights determined by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is necessary to restore a practical and workable solution to the native title mess. As the current act stands, there has been no real benefit delivered to Aboriginal Australians, despite the abundance of claims, many of which are without foundation. Growth and development in Australia has had to remain at a standstill. I have received many letters on this issue, but I received one the other day from a constituent in Western Australia which I found particularly disturbing. They were demanding that this bill be overturned; that it be thrown out. They did not care what effect that would have on people on pastoral leases because they believed they had too much say in Australia anyway. I find that sort of attitude very sad and very blinkered. I wonder if that person would be prepared to go to the people who provide export dollars for Australia, who live under very harsh climates and conditions, and say, `Fall off your land. Give up your life. Go on the employment queue.' They do not ever 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> connect the two with jobs, income for Australia, certainty for Australia and what it means to future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is vital in so far as Western Australia's interests are concerned as it will facilitate the legislative provisions of the Western Australian government in regard to successful land management under land title. In Western Australia the traditional use of land by Aboriginal people is recognised and, where traditional use is impaired or extinguished in any way, compensation will be paid. Under this bill 75 per cent of compensation will be picked up by the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia produces more export income for Australia than any other state, yet we are not able to pursue the full potential of what the state has to offer because of Labor's bad Native Title Act. Uncertainty regarding native title has seen many large scale developments put on the backburner. There is mention among many in industry and tourism that investment capital is simply moving offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Pilbara region many new exploration leases have been put on hold. It is important to remember that the mining industry in that area employs one&hyphen;third of the population, with the rest totally dependent upon it in supporting sectors. Similarly, the Goldfields Land Council has taken to lodging objections to exploration leases as a matter of course, regardless of the merits. In the past week alone some 50 objections by this group were lodged with the Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the state of Western Australia as a whole, a very definite pattern is beginning to emerge regarding the objections lodged against exploration leases. For the fortnight ending 31 January 1997, there were 224 objections. For the fortnight ending 9 May 1997, there were 334 objections. For the fortnight ending 26 September 1997, there were 553 objections. For the fortnight ending 7 November 1997, there were 642 objections lodged against the granting of exploration licences. This has got out of hand. The floodgates have opened.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9616">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a sure and steady rise in the number of objections lodged against licences to the extent that they have almost tripled over the past year. Just as tellingly but more drastic is the incredible rise in the number of exploration licences subject to negotiation. The numbers of exploration licences subject to negotiation in the same fortnightly periods were 64 in the January 1997 fortnight; 86 in the May 1997 fortnight; 232 in the September 1997 fortnight; and 283 in the November 1997 fortnight. What is the cause of the rise in objections lodged and licences subject to negotiation? The answer is simple: the inadequate legislation&mdash;the current act&mdash;has opened the right to negotiate process to total exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make the point that many miners in Western Australia are not large, multinational companies which can afford the high level negotiations and compensatory measures that are currently required under the present arrangements. For example, I understand that Hamersley Iron has recently been successful in entering into an agreement with the Gamala Group to open up the area around the proposed Yandicoogina mine. However, the agreement came at a cost of some $60 million. What chance do the smaller miners in this area have, some of which are only partnerships with very few employees, of coming to similar arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that native title as it stands goes well beyond the large industry groups often found in Western Australia. I draw the attention of the Senate to the plight of the relatively small land&hyphen;holders of the south west of Western Australia. In the Manypeaks, Perillup and Rocky Gully areas alone there have been five overlapping claims. This area is not one big pastoral grazing property on the fringe of the desert, as those opposite would have us believe, but farming properties that have been owned and operated by families for many years. They are not pastoral leases given over for grazing but conditional purpose leases and perpetual leases for farming development. Unlike pastoral leases, the holders of these properties have been given full use of the title and are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now fully functioning, productive farming properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without this legislation, however, the rights of farmers in this region have been thrown into doubt by five overlapping claims which have forced all farmers to immediately suspend planning for their future. Australia cannot afford that. This is not an outlandish claim and I have been made aware of numerous instances where farmers in this area and many others across the state have been unable to sell their farms until some settlement has been agreed. When one considers that, so far throughout Australia some 660 claims have been lodged yet only two have been successfully determined, I suggest that these individuals will have a very long and totally unacceptable wait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that same area of the south&hyphen;west currently subject to numerous claims, there are a total of 450 perpetual leases and 250 conditional purchase leases affected. These leases were allocated by the Western Australian government for agricultural development in the 1950s and 1960s following World War II and have been continuously farmed ever since. As I say, it is not just the large multi&hyphen;million acreage grazing properties of the north that we are discussing, but the average family farms too, which affects the mums and dads of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the mess created by the Labor government has also had an impact on residential properties. In the same area of the south&hyphen;west I have been made aware of a retired couple who had planned to build their dream home on land allocated by the local government for residential development. While waiting for their home to be built, the couple resigned themselves to living in a caravan for the short time required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the land that was designated then became the subject of a native title claim. After three years of living in a caravan awaiting an outcome, that same couple gave up and had to apply for special planning permission to annex a small block off a nearby freehold farm to build their house. Incidentally, that same land is still a long way from determination and that couple could very easily have been living in a caravan for several more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9617"> years. Anyone who says that that is an acceptable process and procedure will have a lot of explaining to do to me and to people who are so affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there is the example of what is happening to residential land in the north&hyphen;west. The Pilbara is the growing powerhouse of resource development the Australia. At present the population is about 45,000. However, this number has been estimated to grow rapidly over the coming years in response to the planned offshore gas projects, and that has had an extremely severe impact on the housing market. When trying to cope with the market pressures, the various local authorities have identified land needs for housing development, which include 800 lots in the Baynton area and 40 lots in the Pretty Pool subdivision of Port Hedland, along with more land for the accompanying light industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, all of these developments have been held up by native title claims, which has had the obvious effect of artificially inflating the residential market to unprecedented levels. In Karratha alone there has been a staggering 200 per cent to 300 per cent increase in land values in just 18 months. The shire has identified 70 lots available within the town site, but this falls short of the 2,500 the Western Australian Planning Commission says is needed for the medium term, let alone the several hundred just for next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It defies any logic for people to tell me that they are buying up the last blocks of land around Port Hedland and Karratha. Look at the size and extent of this country and the resources of this country, yet they are saying that those towns are running out of land. They do not mean there is not any land there; they mean land that they can now buy and live on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10-point plan is not about extinguishment; it is about responsible land management for the future of this country. As I have said before, there are currently 660 claim applications for determination covering 45 per cent of Australia and only two have been successfully determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal Australians comprise around two per cent of the population, yet they already own or control 15 per cent of Australia and, after the passage of this bill, 79 per cent of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia will still be open to native title claim. Where is the extinguishment? Where is the racism? Aboriginal Australians also have access to the indigenous land fund&mdash;$1.3 billion held in trust for the sole purpose of land acquisition; $45 million per year, every year, forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many Aboriginal people to whom I speak, particularly in the north of Western Australia, who want this resolved as well. It is so contradictory for some of the Aboriginal spokespersons to be claiming to speak for and on behalf of all Aboriginal people, because they simply do not. They do not speak on behalf of a lot of those people in the north&hyphen;west of my state who want this issue resolved, believe that the 10&hyphen;point plan is the correct solution, and believe that Australia should be allowed to get on, grow and develop with some certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what they want for their families and their livelihoods. They do not want this to be bogged down forever, but their voices never get heard. It is the squeaky gate that makes the most noise that gets the most reporting, because that serves the purpose of a very biased media who simply only wants to put one side of the story and not both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this bill provides a fair response to all Australians and its passing is vital for the future of this country. In so saying, I certainly hope that Western Australian Labor, Democrat and Independent senators will support this bill for the certainty of Western Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is truly one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before the Senate. It is important not just for its content, but for what it represents. It represents an opportunity to embrace the concept of reconciliation and coexistence with Australia's indigenous people and if we fail to take that opportunity, if we fail to travel down that road of reconciliation, then I believe our nation faces a bleak, uncertain and divisive future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me one very simple point stands out in this debate. Aboriginal people, with a real generosity of spirit, have come to the negotiating table with an extraordinary willingness 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9618"> to make the compromises necessary to pursue genuine reconciliation. They have lost a great deal and yet they have been willing throughout the native title debates of recent years to make concessions and to agree to a reasonable compromise. Their restraint and their patience have been extraordinary. That restraint and patience has been rewarded, not with a genuine compromise on native title, but with a piece of legislation which, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, provides `bucketloads of extinguishment' for native title. It significantly diminishes the rights of indigenous Australians. It is legislation which reflects the unfounded assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the High Court's Wik decision `pushed the pendulum too far in the Aboriginal direction'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another very conspicuous element in the recent debate on native title. At every point at which the Prime Minister has been given the opportunity to show genuine moral leadership on these issues, to stand up for the rights of indigenous Australians and to put to rest the paranoia and exaggerations about the impact of Wik, he has failed to do so. In fact, quite the opposite. He has taken virtually every opportunity to further misrepresent both the impact of the Wik decision and of his own 10-point plan. In recent weeks, for example, he has taken to running around the country with a map purporting to show that 78 per cent of the country is susceptible to native title claims. That is fundamentally misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A much more realistic map, such as the one produced by Professor John Holmes from the University of Queensland, gives a more honest picture of the reality of native title claims. Professor Holmes's map shows how native title can co-exist and will co-exist with pastoral leases&mdash;the precise question the Prime Minister is attempting to resolve with his 10-point plan. Professor Holmes divides Australia into four zones. In zone A, Aboriginal people have only limited localised connections to the land, or there is no evidence of any ongoing Aboriginal connection. In these areas there will be no significant impact on pastoralists. In zone B there is solid and extensive evidence of a connection to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land. The effect of successful claims in these areas will be similar to the access rights for traditional owners already existing in South Australia and in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In zone C there is widespread and strong connection over lands of marginal pastoral value. Here the effect of successful claims would require new regional land use agreements. Finally, in zone D, which covers much of the country, there are no pastoral leases at all. In other words, zone D is where native title is already extinguished or where native title claims are not going to come into conflict with the rights of pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the map from that more realistic and honest perspective it becomes apparent, contrary to the exaggerated claims of the opponents of native title, that only a relatively small part of the country is going to be subject to native title claims which will bring them into potential conflict with other land users. Where that conflict does emerge there is, I believe, a compelling argument for negotiation as the way to resolve it. Inconvenience is not a ground for trampling on people's rights. The annoyance felt by some miners and pastoralists in having to sit down and talk with indigenous people does not warrant the extinguishment of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that an acceptable starting position in this debate is the proposition that indigenous rights are as important as the rights of other land users. That seems to us to be a very fair proposition. We need to be very clear about this. With the exception of the Deputy Prime Minister, I think no-one is suggesting that the holders of freehold in Australia are in any danger of losing their land to native title claims. But I want to pause for a moment and read an extract from a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister to a constituent, referring to the Native Title Act, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That certainty was overridden by the recent High Court's decision on Wik. The same principle could apply to your suburb of Castlemaine with regard to freehold. Your title, which you purchased in good faith and with certainty, can also be thrown into doubt. There is the perception that the Wik decision is primarily a problem for those Australians living outside metropolitan cities and that the Wik 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9619"> decision affects only pastoralists and primary producers. This is simply not the case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the holders of leases, as we all know, are not generally land owners. They are land users. The land is not theirs. They generally do not have a right of exclusive possession to that land. They have been granted temporary use of the land for specific purposes, usually with some limits placed on what they can do with the property for the duration of the lease. Pastoral leases have been granted by the people of Australia. The land is not privately owned land. Having granted that lease, I believe the people of Australia are entitled to say to those lease holders: `We are now formally requiring you to share the use of that land with some other land users, in this case indigenous people who have maintained some connection with that particular piece of land.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I do not think that is an especially unfair or onerous proposition. It is certainly a lot fairer than simply upgrading those leases to effectively exclude possession, a move that not only extinguishes native title but also represents a free gift of land from the rest of Australia to a minority of leaseholders. This does not seem to me to be a fair method of national land management, let alone a just upholding of the land rights of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt there will be many others in this debate who will speak to the detail of the legislation and the question of its constitutional validity. I want to talk mainly about the right to negotiate and about the important role to be played, which I think is already being played, by local government in that negotiating process. The Australian Local Government Association is to be congratulated for the leading role which it has played in this regard, which stands in stark contrast to the `unworkability' that the government would like us to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I attended the National General Assembly of Local Government here in Canberra and I was handed a series of resolutions carried by that assembly. Those resolutions reflect the desire of local councils and shires throughout Australia to show leadership in the reconciliation and native title negotiation process. I want to place on record in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate part of the statement from that general assembly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Councils share a vision for reconciliation. Many entered into agreements and commitments with their Indigenous people. Many have also apologised to those of their citizens who have suffered deeply from policies of forcibly removing Aboriginal children from their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the third sphere of government, now is the time for us to be part of the healing process. The 750 delegates at this year's National General Assembly of Local government have approached this with an open heart. This is vitally important to the process of building inclusive and cohesive communities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The assembly also expressed its `deep and sincere regret at the hurt and distress caused by policies which forcibly removed Aboriginal children from their families and homes'. As a former local government councillor, I felt a great sense of pride in the assembly and the Australian Local Government Association for being unafraid to show leadership in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another show of leadership comes from the Western Australian Municipal Association, whose production&mdash;in conjunction with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the ALGA&mdash;of the booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with native title</EMPHASIS> represents a very significant contribution to the native title process. Councillor Ken Pech, the President of the Western Australian Municipal Association, in his preface to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with native title</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge is to accept that the building and development of our modern Nation has involved the dispossession of land from the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia, and to accept responsibility for dealing justly with the consequences. This can only be worked out over time with very careful thought and patient negotiations by all parties on the basis of mutual respect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local governments should expand their acknowledged community leadership function by establishing local processes which open up avenues for dialogue with Indigenous Australians, to ensure that native title and reconciliation issues generally, are dealt with fairly, openly and appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His words reflect the content and tone of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with native title</EMPHASIS>  booklet. It is a booklet which offers a practical guide for local governments to resolve native title 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9620"> claims. It does so from a basis not of fear or hysteria, but of a genuine desire to achieve workable and fair outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Redland shire agreement in Queensland shows how a fair and a reasonable settlement can be reached when local government adopts such an approach. It shows what can be achieved when both sides bring genuine goodwill and mutual respect to the negotiating table. That same level of goodwill and respect is of course conspicuously absent from the government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that this legislation waters down the right of indigenous people to negotiate on native title claims. The fact that some non-indigenous Australians think this is a legitimate course of action to take indicates to me how little respect there is for the rights and entitlements of indigenous Australians. There seems to be this perception that some rights, non-indigenous ones, are somehow intrinsically worth more than indigenous ones. Indigenous Australians have already given great ground on these issues. For example, they have accepted the need for a tougher threshold test for the lodging of native title claims. But they should not be expected to roll over and give further negotiating rights up simply because some non-indigenous Australians claim a greater right to have certainty in their use of lease land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside for a moment the question of whether or not the bill will actually deliver certainty, there are compelling arguments as to why the so-called need for certainty should fall a long way second to the basic rights of indigenous people to negotiate native title access. If they had chosen to, indigenous Australians could have simply refused to compromise on that basis. But, in their generosity of spirit, indigenous Australians have shown their willingness to give and take and to go a considerable way towards delivering as much certainty as possible without allowing their rights to be trampled into the dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation before us in the Senate is proof that the Howard government has not returned that restraint and that respect. When the government of the day is unable to find the heart, the integrity and the moral courage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to deliver a fair outcome on native title to indigenous Australians, the last democratic resort becomes the Australian parliament&mdash;and the Senate now holds the future of reconciliation in its hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all senators to treat the native title rights of indigenous Australians with respect and honesty, just as they deserve. I urge you to give our indigenous people a reason to have faith in the capacity of the parliament of this nation to take a gigantic step towards and not away from genuine conciliation. It is time to stop this dispossession.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of sadness that I rise to participate in this debate today. Four years ago, when we debated this, the now government, the then opposition, completely abrogated their responsibility in participating in this debate and in the decisions that were made by this chamber. They took the opportunity to oppose every clause of the bill in the most unconstructive and the most destructive way that they could possibly have done so. They excluded themselves from participation. That is very sad. They excluded themselves from consultation. They also, by these actions, to me at least, give me the impression that they saw nothing wrong with the way things were previously, which was that all land title was based on an assumption of terra nullius. For anybody in their right mind to try to justify the claim that there was nobody living in this country prior to 1788 is astonishing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I am saddened also by some of the contributions, and I say `some of the contributions', that I have heard today and previously&mdash;by the lack of caring and community, the lack of appreciation that this country has many diverse cultures and many diverse views, and the lack of appreciation that we need to work together to co&hyphen;exist. Co&hyphen;existence was at the heart of the Wik determination. The Wik determination said that in some cases pastoral leases and native title could co&hyphen;exist. But, more importantly, it went on to confirm that there was a primacy for pastoral leases against any native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere have I heard from any of the members of the now government that particular point being made and being highlighted. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9621"> Nowhere in all of the phones calls I have taken from people who have pastoral leases in the western lands area of New South Wales have they displayed an understanding of that. They have not been given an understanding by their members of parliament in the lower House that those with pastoral leases have primacy over native title where there is conflict. To not point out that particular part of the caveat that Justice Toohey put on the lead decision is grossly wrong. I would suggest that it is grossly immoral that this point has not been brought home to people or that they have not at least been told about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of scaremongering has been done in western New South Wales by people who should know better&mdash;I thought they knew better until last night, when I heard about a letter that was written by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) to a woman in Victoria saying that they could come and take freehold. Given that the Deputy Prime Minister or an adviser wrote that letter, one has to wonder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate who have western leases have certainly never been given the full details of the full determination by the High Court, and I think that that is very sad. These people have been given part but not all of the information. They have been given the part of the information that then allowed people to become agitators and that stirred them up and provided them with a whole set of scenarios that I do not know how could even exist or even come to fruition. It enabled a great deal of concern and anger to be sown in these people's minds. It was very irresponsible of whomever undertook the exercise of spreading that information not to provide the full details of that ruling. It ill&hyphen;behoves whoever spread that information to speak of those people in terms that are derogatory and condemnatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important issue. We said in 1993, when the previous bill was going through, that there would have to be amendments. We knew that because the 1993 act remains silent on the issues of pastoral leases and native title. It was to remain silent until the Wik decision was handed down, and the Wik claim at that time was before the High Court. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whilst some legal advice was certainly given that pastoral leases probably extinguished native title, the Wik case was the reason that the original bill was silent on that issue&mdash;it was left for the courts to decide. So we always knew we were going to be coming back for amendments. I am still very angry and sad that the then opposition did not take into consideration what was needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here about an Australian community that is very rich and diverse in its cultures and its spiritual beliefs. If you talked to the Aboriginal people and listened to the stories of their spiritual beliefs, you would understand some of the reasons why they seek native title. If you talked to the pastoralists and the farmers who have been on the land for three or four generations, you would understand their appreciation of the land as well. What I find difficult to comprehend is that these people who have developed an affinity with the land after three or four generations cannot comprehend the affinity with the land that someone whose ancestors have been here for 40,000 years must be feeling. Multiply it by 10,000 times and you might just begin to get it into some perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that during this debate we have heard from white people&mdash;very brave people, in my estimation&mdash;from those areas who have actually looked very closely at the issue and have consulted and negotiated with their black friends and with the black people that live in their area. They have come to an understanding of what they are about and have reached consensus and conciliation and are happy to allow access for traditional uses, such as ceremonies and access to sacred sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't the Aboriginal population want to visit the grave sites, the burial sites, of their ancestors? The white community want to do that. We are keen to know our ancestry and where our ancestors lie. Why wouldn't Aboriginals want to do that? Of course they do, and we have an obligation to ensure that there is co&hyphen;existence, that there is cooperation. We are not going to get that by `bucketloads of extinguishment'. That sends the wrong messages to everybody. It sends a message that one group is superior to another; it sends 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9622"> a message that one group has rights that another group does not have. I find this most concerning and most alarming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought we were here to govern and make legislation for all people, not to discriminate against any one particular group of person in this community. I have grave concerns that what this government is trying to do discriminates against one minority group in this community. I think it is interesting to read the comments from Peter Wertheim, the President of the Jewish Board of Deputies, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of 6 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I could at least speak for the Jewish community when I say that we will not be mute, we will not maintain a criminal silence in the face of continuing attempts of genocide against indigenous Australians, even if it is genocide by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from a group of the community who have been a minority in other places and who have suffered grievously at other people's hands. It is well worth remembering that we are a community that has a very diverse culture. It is important that we recognise and remember that, to be a community, you have to recognise each other's differences, each other's strengths and work together. It is cooperation; it is co&hyphen;existence. I prefer the word cooperation to co&hyphen;existence. We need the community to care for one another and respect one another's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that there are not problems out there at present. I am certainly aware of areas where there are multiple claims over one area of land. That has led to conflict and argument, not just between the black and the white communities but between members of the white community and between members of the black community. It is absolutely essential that we strengthen the threshold test in this legislation, because the threshold testing was put into doubt by previous cases from the High Court. This legislation's ability to tighten that and to remove the uncertainty will certainly see a lot more clarity in the situation and the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But some of the people I have spoken to&mdash;members of conservative parties have been spoken to&mdash;are not even aware that there are amendments in this legislation to tighten the threshold test. They have not even had that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basic information passed on to them by their members of parliament. That is absolutely appalling. It just goes to reinforce my concerns that there are members in the lower House&mdash;I do not know about the upper house&mdash;who would appear not to have been providing adequate information to their community. I am absolutely horrified at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people understood the situation, they would feel less scared, they would feel less angry and angered and they may then be able to actually understand the messages they need to understand. But some of these people have been stirred up and whipped up to such a state that, if you try very logically to explain and provide information, they refuse to listen. Their ears have been shut to what other people may wish to say, to what factual information people may wish to give. This failure to provide factual information to these communities is pretty appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know there are many problems with the administration of the Native Title Act. We know there has to be a tightening of the threshold test. We know there has been only one claim that has made it all the way through the tribunal. The system is clogged up with claims, some that are quite legitimate, and some that are multiple claims on the one piece of land where there is disagreement amongst the Aboriginals who are making the claims as to who has the right to make that claim. It would be fair to say that on occasions there are spurious claims and claims that would have very little, if any, chance at all if it were not for the fact that there is a very light threshold test, or that the threshold test is not being applied. In fact, if we get a tight threshold test, a lot of these claims will immediately fall by the wayside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Western Division pastoralists need to know, as do all pastoralists, is that they can go about earning their living the way they have always done&mdash;that they can use the land for all the purposes they did pre&hyphen;Wik. It is very important to remember that in the Western Division lands the leases are leases in perpetuity. But their land use is very much restricted by government because it is a fragile land, and in many areas they are not allowed to undertake any other agricultural 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9623"> activity except grazing. Other areas they have been allowed to farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government was given one lot of legal advice that it was uncertain as to whether these leases had extinguished native title, and the Commonwealth has had similar advice. That is why they have been excluded from the list the government has put up for mass extinguishment. So these people, if this bill were to get through without being amended in any great way, might be in a more certain position than others because their land use title is fairly clear. But it is always the case that, where a title claim is in conflict with a lease, the lease will have primacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Division people will not get certainty if they extinguish native title and if indigenous people tie them up in the courts claiming common law rights for any length of time. Wholesale extinguishment is a recipe for decades of expensive litigation and huge compensation bills&mdash;bills that this country cannot afford. We should not agree to allow the government to plough on the way it wants to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that we think should be moved will make quite sure that pastoralists can run their properties effectively and efficiently without being tied up negotiating native title or paying compensation. The Wik decision makes it clear that pastoralists' rights prevail where there is any inconsistency with native title. I cannot make that point enough. It is something that people need to begin to understand. When that happens, people will feel a lot more settled, more certain and less traumatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about co&hyphen;existence&mdash;something that many pastoralists have lived with harmoniously for generations. It is true; I have spoken to both black and white communities who have lived in harmony. Whatever the pastoralists might have thought were their rights in the past, we must all face the fact that Mabo and Wik have told us that native title is a real property right which existed before European settlement and has survived in some places whether or not we were aware of it. We cannot now pretend that it does not exist, that it is not entitled to the same respect as any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other property right or that extinguishment by parliament would not lead to decades of litigation, uncertainty and compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I am somewhat saddened by some of the debate that has taken place, but I am impressed by some of the speeches that have been made. It is important that we never lose sight of the fact that we need to live in a community that is just and fair&mdash;fair to all, not one group being favoured above another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to end with some comments by former colleagues who have been in this place. Some of them were here when I was here. Ian Viner, a former Liberal Aboriginal affairs minister, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 8 November said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is a disaster for the nation, to have a Government so deliberately prepared to divide the community on a racial issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Neville Bonner, a former Liberal senator&mdash;of course, people will remember that Neville is in fact an Aboriginal&mdash;on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  of 29 October said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, what else can you call it but racist, and what else can you call it but detrimental?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ian Macphee, a former Fraser cabinet minister, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Weekly</EMPHASIS>  of 11 November to 17 November said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There are any number of well&hyphen;considered comments along those lines from previous Liberal Party members of parliament. The current Liberal Party members of parliament would do well to reflect upon the comments of their former colleagues because they are people who have worked in the area and have developed a great deal of expertise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . The genesis of this bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9624"> is the Mabo decision, in which the High Court recognised the form of land title known as native title based on indigenous people's traditions and customs. In response, Labor introduced the Native Title Act 1993. This act had many shortcomings. They were highlighted by the courts in the Wik decision, Brandy decision and the Waanyi decision. The result is clear: the act needs amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public concentration appears to have been on the Wik decision, which was contrary to the preamble to the Native Title Act itself, the then Prime Minister's second reading speech and Noel Pearson's address to the National Press Club&mdash;all of which were of the view that pastoral leases extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect, I engage Senator West in relation to her comments about pastoral leases and native title. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and public commentary is absolutely littered with quotations from her then ministers who were of the view that native title was extinguished through pastoral leases. Indeed, a former colleague of hers from her home state of New South Wales, Graham Richardson, said as much. He said that in the deliberations in the cabinet room it was the view that native title had been extinguished on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Tickner, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, said in November 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the government's clear advice, from all the quarters that it had sought legal advice, that the effect of the grant of a pastoral lease was to extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It ill behoves Senator West to come into this place and try to rewrite history. Her own Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, was of the view that pastoral leases extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West also made some comments about sacred sites. I agree with her about the importance of those sacred sites and the need and the right of the indigenous community of this country to visit those sites. Senator West said she was concerned that people were not providing adequate information. I say to Senator West that that is why we have the Heritage Protection Act. If you want to protect sacred sites, you ensure, as this government is doing at this very moment, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the heritage protection legislation is in place and working well and, if need be, is amended to ensure that it works well for the protection of those sacred sites. I do not think that native title was ever meant or designed, and it was not in the minds of the judiciary, to be part of a regime to protect sacred sites. They are protected under different legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who were critical of the Wik decision have unfortunately been described by some with fairly inflammatory language. Let me say that the government upholds the decision of the High Court in Wik in its amendment bill. But let us debunk the nonsense of seeking to ascribe motives to those who disagree with the Wik decision. In doing so, it may be helpful to be reminded that three High Court judges disagreed with the Wik decision. They in fact dissented in that decision. Were they somehow racially motivated? I hardly think so because guess who one of the dissenting judges was&mdash;none other than Chief Justice Brennan, who was the author of the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take that in context, you realise that genuinely motivated people can come to a difference of opinion on these important issues, without having to be tagged with comments such as racist scum and things of that nature. People can be genuinely motivated and come to a different conclusion. I think that needs to be understood in this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator West tried to portray it, the Wik decision sounded so simple. Co&hyphen;existence could occur between native title holders and pastoral lease holders. If there was a conflict, the pastoral lease rights would prevail. In its simplicity, the judgment, unfortunately, raised more questions than it answered. Senator Nick Minchin, the Special Minister of State, has been asked to answer some of those questions, in a legislative framework that is fair to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the option to allow the courts to continue to provide certainty through decades of court proceedings. There was the other option, which was to legislate to provide for the certainty for all Australians that is so desperately needed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9625">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a situation where you can draw a simple line and say, `Pastoral lease rights start here and end here, and native title rights cut in at this particular point.' There will, unfortunately, be areas of grey in between, where there will be some degree of overlap, and there needs to be certainty in those areas. What we as a government have tried to do is to provide that degree of certainty and delineation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor drafted its Native Title Act of 1993 on the clear assumption that native title was extinguished by the granting of pastoral leases. Within their act there was no regime for co&hyphen;existing titles. Hence our introduction of a regime of indigenous land use agreements, which will allow communities to come to their own agreements. I ask, rhetorically, `Where is the embracing of this initiative by the critics of the legislation?' Their campaign of division does not allow them to publicly support these initiatives, because they do not fit in with their campaign of misinformation. Only a few of the letters I have received out of the many hundreds in my office have acknowledged this positive initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some issues have captured the public's attention in this debate. The first is the role of the Racial Discrimination Act. Labor has proposed an amendment to the bill that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act prevail over the provisions of our bill only. It is this sort of stunt and tactic which occasions community concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor are saying, `The Racial Discrimination Act ought to apply to the Liberal legislation but not to our previous legislation.' Labor senators, Senator Cooney, Senator McKiernan and Senator Chris Evans, have a bit of explaining to do. In 1993, they were members of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, which was asked to report on the Native Title Act to the Senate. Guess what they said in paragraph 1.86(a) of their majority report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill should be amended to make clear that it is the intention of the Parliament that the Bill is consistent with the RDA. . . .This should <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">not</EMPHASIS>  provide that the Bill is subject to the RDA because of the uncertainty that would create&mdash;contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In short, Labor say, `The Racial Discrimination Act ought to apply to Liberal legislation but not to ours', while recognising, as they did in the report I quoted, that to do so would&mdash;contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation&mdash;create uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's proposed amendment is a classic case of the forked tongue in action. It highlights Labor's duplicity and campaign of division and their desire to create uncertainty and havoc. Where Labor failed, they do not want us as a government to succeed. Labor recognised the need for certainty, and so do we as a government. The Labor senators opposite made that recommendation because they recognised that need. But, when it is our legislation, they back away from it at 100 miles an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that needs to be clarified is the right to negotiate. This is a right established by legislation for native title claimants. I would like to add here that there is a fundamental difference between being a native claimant and being a native title holder. A claimant is simply a person or group making a claim for native title. Making a claim does not mean the person or group is assured of being successful in that claim. Everybody knows and our indigenous friends fully acknowledge that there are many spurious and vexatious claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the state governments under the current legislation are required by the Native Title Act to negotiate in good faith, even if the actual claim itself is not brought in good faith. Hence the need to require all parties to negotiate in good faith and to have a rigorous threshold test. That is the test which claimants have to pass before their claim can be registered and the benefit of the statutory provisions can cut in. Such a test would limit the number of multiple claims for native title that coincidentally materialise over gold mining and other resource rich areas. These multiple claims cause intra&hyphen;indigenous conflict and demean the currency of native title, thereby developing cynicism toward the concept of native title in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue to be dealt with is the concept that all people involved in agriculture 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9626"> through government leases or licences are somehow either rich or foreign corporations. That is simply untrue. The claim that `this legislation gives massive capital gains in land values to participants, many of whom voted this legislation into being'&mdash;as was asserted to me by a number of church groups&mdash;is simply untrue. Indeed, yesterday in a previous debate Labor Senator Bob Collins acknowledged as much through an interjection to me. Unfortunately, those sorts of claims that are made are divisive and very hurtful to the struggling rural and regional communities and are simply based on gross ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Native Title Act came into being, its scope was deemed to be very narrow. As a result, a substantial indigenous land fund of $1.289 billion was established to enable the indigenous communities to purchase land for their needs at the rate of $45 million per annum in perpetuity&mdash;and this in circumstances where our indigenous community, representing approximately two per cent of the population, has control or ownership of around 15 per cent of the landmass. It was in this context that the discussion about the size of the land fund took place: that the chance of getting a native title claim up was most unlikely and therefore such a huge fund ought to be made available. I support the fund. I think it was a very proper thing to do in the circumstances. I still believe that to be the case. But it should be remembered that the assessments made at the time as to the sweep of native title were very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me at this stage to quote for the record Mr Noel Pearson, who said on 10 November 1993 at the National Press Club, `I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases . . . It would be as fruitless as pursuing native title claims in relation to valid freehold titles.' They were the words of Noel Pearson. That was his understanding at the time. That was the government's understanding at the time. But we now know that that was wrong. Fine, but let us not forget that the indigenous land fund was set up on the basis of that understanding of the law and that Noel Pearson said that a claim over pastoral leases would be as fruitless as it would be over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> freehold. Unfortunately, we know that claims have been lodged over both. That, unfortunately, causes community disharmony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also make a brief comment in relation to the very inflammatory language employed by Messrs Pat Dodson and Ian Viner in relation to this legislation when they sought to describe it&mdash;it being a bill of 293 pages&mdash;as `293 pages of extinguishment'. That is simply untrue, simply inflammatory and has no basis in fact whatsoever&mdash;and that coming from people who were allegedly the chairman and vice&hyphen;chairman of the reconciliation council! Most unfortunate language when it is acknowledged by many people, as Senator Harradine did yesterday, that quite a considerable amount of this legislation is not contentious. Yet, to make a cheap political point, people who are charged with the task of promoting reconciliation make those sorts of inflammatory comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, those sorts of inflammatory comments have been taken up by the church communities in a campaign in which they have largely spoken from a position of ignorance. Let me sidetrack briefly on to this. The churches, as indeed everybody within this community, have a right to be actively engaged in the public debate, and so I hope it shall ever be within this country. But I also hope that when people, especially churches, do speak they will engage themselves on the basis of being well informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the call from many of the churches and other people for the legislation to be withdrawn or defeated is very ill considered because to do so would mean that all those non&hyphen;contentious areas that Senator Harradine referred to&mdash;those that are necessitated by the Waanyi decision and the Brandy decision of the courts&mdash;would not come into being and the whole structure of native title and the regime of native title in this country would be brought into even greater disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been one of the things lacking in this whole discussion about native title. I found, as a former chairman of this parliament's native title committee and as an ongoing member of it, that the hearings and the submissions always seemed to deal in broad, sweeping statements. But, when you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9627"> asked people to put those broad, sweeping statements aside and you invited them what clause they were referring to in making a particular assertion, a strange silence overcame them because they could not engage in the actual letter of the legislation. They were not aware of what the legislation was saying. What they were doing was, unfortunately, repeating platitudes and other comments made by other people and they did not have a working knowledge of the legislation themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with the specific issues and the real&hyphen;life, day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day examples is a lot more difficult. It requires an understanding mind and a degree of intellectual rigour, and I submit to this Senate that Senator Minchin has displayed both. The degree of consultation undertaken was exemplary. At the request of ATSIC, specific amendments appear in this legislation, as introduced, which are proof positive that it was at all times in the loop of consultations. Some types of land tenure and activities that local government and the states wanted included in the legislation were specifically rejected by the federal government in its desire to come to a fair outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, there has been a history of dispossession in this country. Many injustices occurred on both sides, but mainly against our Aborigines. We as a nation are paying the consequences of that inhumanity. We are seeking to address that inhumanity through many programs of support and assistance. Native title is an important step in that process but the wisdom of Solomon is needed to ensure that as we resolve one injustice we do not create another injustice in its place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence my speech today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of Canberra and the ACT, the Ngunnawal people, whose traditional land I stand upon. As a Queenslander I would also like to acknowledge the struggles of the Wik people whose story was outlined so graphically by my colleague Senator Woodley in his speech on this bill. I would also like to specifically acknowledge the Torres Strait 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Islander people from the very top of the state of Queensland and the wonderful legacy of Eddie Mabo, and his supporters, who also doggedly pursued a long struggle for justice, with great results not just for his own people but for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago in my first speech to this chamber I mentioned what a tragedy it is that the golden and positive opportunity presented to our nation by native title and the High Court Wik decision has been squandered. This squandering of an opportunity is something which we as parliamentarians should perhaps bear an extra degree of responsibility for above others in the Australian community. Governments and parliaments have failed over many years to deal with land issues affecting indigenous people and it is about time that we shouldered that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to emphasise in my contribution today that native title is something that should be embraced, not feared; it should be celebrated, not attacked. It is possible and, indeed, desirable to see the native title issue, the High Court Wik decision, as an opportunity to contribute to reconciliation. As Senator Harradine said in his contribution, it is an opportunity to restore trust and to deal with issues without affecting but in fact promoting the development of Australia, both socially and economically. Others have tried to suggest in this debate that development has ground to a halt as a result of native title, that the cogs of our progress are being rusted or, to use Senator Lightfoot's disgraceful phrase, `the dead hand of native title' is stopping progress. Such suggestions are simply wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention a few positive agreements and developments which have occurred directly because of native title&mdash;not in spite of it or regardless of it, but because of the positive opportunities that native title has presented to us. I would like to emphasise the positive nature of these situations&mdash;these are win&hyphen;win situations. The list includes a few from areas outside my home state: the joint venture goldmine in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory; the urban subdivision negotiated with the Dunghutti Aboriginal people; an iron ore mine in the Pilbara region 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9628"> of WA; agreements and ongoing negotiations involving a recreation area in Byron Bay; the Cape York land use agreement negotiations, which have received a lot of publicity over many years; and a recently established bauxite mining and shipping operation in Weipa on Cape York. I would like to quote briefly from the October edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unity News</EMPHASIS> put out by the Cape York Land Council about that agreement. This is what Brian Sawyer, the board director of Alcan, said to the Cape York traditional owners at the ceremony highlighting the signing of the final agreement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Thank you for letting Alcan use your land." The agreement is the beginning of an ongoing partnership which should see both groups working together to maximise the benefits of the bauxite mining project and to address many other issues of importance to the local indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would also like to make special mention of a recent agreement that was reached, close to where I live, near Brisbane between the Redlands Shire Council and the Quandamooka Land Council. It was signed on North Stradbroke Island&mdash;for people who have not been there, it is a wonderful place&mdash;in August this year. It was a historic agreement and a positive example of the opportunity native title presents to bring people together, to explore and to walk forward together into the future. The basis of the agreement was that both parties accepted the other's rights, interests and custodial obligations over the area and wanted to ensure that the special environment of North Stradbroke Island and surrounding Moreton Bay is preserved for present and future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Redlands Shire Council and the Quandamooka Land Council chose mediation rather than litigation as a resolution process for all the issues involved. Mediation represents a commitment by both parties to an outcome which suits everybody's interests&mdash;the parties involved and the broader community. I would like to congratulate all parties involved for what they have achieved with this agreement to date. It is not a static document that is signed and then everything sits still. It is an ongoing process. That is what it is all about; it is not about figuring it all out and locking it in and then saying, `That's that one solved. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Let's go and do something else.' It is an ongoing evolutionary process. That is the approach we all need to take in relation to the native title issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the initial discussions for this agreement both parties agreed on two important basic issues: that the Quandamooka people are the original inhabitants of Quandamooka and by their traditional laws and customs hold inherent rights, interests and custodial obligations in relation to  Quandamooka lands and waters, and that the Redlands Shire Council has statutory rights and responsibilities in relation to part of Quandamooka lands and waters. Both parties wanted to ensure that present and future land use on North Stradbroke Island was ecologically sustainable. The signing of the native title process agreements by the shire council and the land council is the first formal step towards achieving ecological sustainability and reconciliation in Redlands shire. It is not simply about land claims and people fighting over who owns what patch of dirt. That is a very simplistic and shallow approach to what is the very rich fabric of native title. This agreement has brought people together to recognise the need for future ecological sustainability, the need to develop reconciliation and community harmony. These things are way beyond who has got title rights to a particular patch of dirt. I think we all need to expand our vision about what native title is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both parties, who represent major interests on North Stradbroke Island, believe that the process will facilitate the recognition of the culture and traditions of the Quandamooka people and that the process of reconciliation will benefit everybody, from long&hyphen;term residents to the occasional or one&hyphen;time visitor. As I said before, it is a wonderful place and it would be a good experience for anybody to visit there. This sort of agreement provides a great opportunity for the continuing presence of indigenous people on the island to be more clearly demonstrated to those who are visitors to the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These examples are just some of the many different types of agreements each of which has its local characteristics. I think that is important too, that it is not a single, monolith 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9629"> ic solution that can be imposed nationally. The national framework is obviously very important, but we also have to recognise that it has to facilitate a variety of different approaches at the local level, where circumstances obviously vary so much from place to place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am outlining these examples to emphasise the positive in relation to native title, to emphasise again that it is not a problem, it is a magnificent opportunity for all Australians if we would only open our eyes. No&hyphen;one says the existing act cannot be improved, but this bill certainly does not improve it&mdash;it makes it very much worse. It is difficult to move forward together on ways of improving the legislation and addressing things that need to be changed in the light of recent court cases in an atmosphere of division, of misinformation and of negativity that has prevailed so much in relation to this issue. That is why I wanted to emphasise the positive opportunities that native title presents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have looked around this chamber since I have come into the Senate, the lack of presence of indigenous people in this chamber is clear, and that is something that has been widely recognised. It is a similar situation in the lower house in this parliament. As a collection of non&hyphen;indigenous people, if we are able to cut away the rhetoric, the important question we need to ask ourselves&mdash;and I would ask it of all senators who are present or paying attention to this speech&mdash;is this: who amongst all of us here in the Senate would like to be treated the way indigenous people are treated every single day of the week? Alternatively, who amongst us here would like to have our children subjected to the conditions that Aboriginal children and Torres Strait Islander children are subjected to every day of the week? I invite any senator who would like to be treated in the same way to perhaps indicate their willingness to receive that treatment when they are speaking on this bill, or to shout out from those who are here at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty clear that we all know how indigenous people and their children are treated in this country. We know that we would not want that for ourselves or for our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children, so why should we be prepared to allow it to happen to others? In a nation that is materially wealthy and technologically advanced, it is staggering to suggest that we do not have the capacity or the knowledge to change the way we treat and cause to be treated or allow to be treated our Aboriginal citizens and our Torres Strait Islander citizens. What we fail in is the political will to effect any change. Native title provides the way forward for people to work together. It should be a mechanism for reducing conflict, an enabling mechanism towards reaching agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This makes it all the more disgraceful when people engage in deliberate misinformation campaigns. Chief amongst those who I believe are guilty of this are the National Farmers Federation. I think the NFF should stand condemned not just for deliberately fostering division and misinformation but for comprehensively betraying the interests of the farmers they are supposed to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who could forget the images of the little Aboriginal boy and the white boy struggling over a Twister board, simulating the illusory land grab? That is a perfect example of a deliberate campaign to misrepresent the facts in this debate and to try to stimulate division. I wonder how much of the money spent on that campaign could have been used to help people in negotiating agreements or in providing legal advice to the farmers that the NFF purports to represent. I think it is a perfect example of peak bodies ignoring the real interests of those they are supposed to represent and pursuing their own agenda. To some extent I think some of the mining bodies could be seen as being guilty of that also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that has been realised by a number of grassroots pastoralists. Fairly recently the former Cattlemen's Union representative at the NFF, Mr Warren McLachlan, said that the farmers federation had irresponsibly put farmers through the emotional wringer through false assertions that their tenure was at risk. It is a clear example of the NFF not only playing a damaging role in terms of the country's interests but also specifically working against the interests of their own constituency.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To treat the dispossession of the Australian Aborigines as the working out of the Crown's acquisition of ownership of all land on first settlement is contrary to history. Aborigines were dispossessed of their land parcel by parcel, to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Their dispossession underwrote the development of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that we have to acknowledge that fact before we can move forward. As my other Democrat colleagues are also outlining in this debate, it is the real history of the nation that we need to acknowledge&mdash;a history that is just beginning to hit the cold light of day. I repeat: it is a history that we must acknowledge before we can move fully forward into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I would like to point out that there exists in relation to this legislation an ongoing struggle between the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party over validation. For the nice technical, legal word of `validation' perhaps we could substitute the words `land laundering,' because that is basically what it is. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Margo Kingston summed up the position accurately by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The left&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the States' illegal grants of mining permits since 1994. Labor feared that it would blow the pending Queensland election otherwise and the right to negotiate over coastal waters&mdash;shadow cabinet was livid at the prospect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My colleague Senator Woodley summed up the position when he said&mdash;as was also reported in that same article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sad to see the ALP collapse their principles to support the validation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">or `land laundering'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In simple words, this means they will not in this place tell the truth which is that the Goss Labor Government attempted to override native title on behalf of mining interests, and that that attempt was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would urge the ALP not to be driven solely by electoral issues in Queensland but to recognise the justice of this issue. I know that struggle in the Labor ranks continues. I do hope that, by the time the committee stage arises, Mr Evans and some of his mining&hyphen;prone interests will see the light on the hill on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of my colleague Senator Bourne, who unfortunately is unwell and therefore unable to speak at this stage of the debate, I would like to touch on some of the international aspects of this issue. Senator Bourne has been a great campaigner on human rights issues over many years. There are many international covenants that are relevant to this issue, including the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and the International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights. Our performance on the native title issue will also impact heavily on our ability to credibly participate in the ongoing development of the UN draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, which is an important declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia wants to maintain its international diplomatic credibility and leverage on human rights issues with other nations, then it is important that we do the right thing in relation to this issue. I quote briefly from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9631"> relation to the international implications. ACFOA is the peak council for many non-government organisations working in the field of overseas aid and development who are often asked by partner agencies overseas what Australians are doing about the situation of Aboriginal people in Australia. That is something that the international community at the local level, as well as the national level, are very much aware of. The situation of our indigenous peoples is one of the first questions international visitors to Australia often raise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by referring again to my first speech from a couple of weeks ago in which I stated, `If only a small effort had been given to exploring and explaining the positive benefits for all of us of the concept and of the opportunities of co-existence, none of the current divisiveness would have been necessary.' I do make this plea to the Senate and to the government: let us not make the same mistake again; let us make that small effort now, while we have the chance. As the marvellous Paul Kelly song says, `From little things, big things grow.' I fervently hope that we, with the important responsibilities we have as parliamentarians and representatives of all the people of Australia, are big enough to take this opportunity to do this little thing&mdash;to make that small effort, open our hearts and minds and embrace the positive opportunities that are presented to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just for ourselves and it is not just for the very real, living and breathing indigenous people around the nation who are still seeking justice today. But this is also for those who have gone before and even more so for those future generations who are yet to come. As I look around the gallery&mdash;and it was great to see it packed with people the other night&mdash;I see that unfortunately this afternoon it is back to its usual empty state. But let us imagine all of those empty seats in the gallery to be filled with future generations who are yet to be born but who are watching us very closely to make sure that we do not betray their future with the legacy we hand on to them, and that the opportunity being presented by native title is not lost on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is Wik? What does this historic High Court decision mean to Australians? How will it impact upon our identity as a nation? How will it change the lives of indigenous Australians? These are questions that must be considered alongside the technical provisions of the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill presented an opportunity for the government to enshrine the principles of the Wik High Court decision in legislation and, hence, proceed another step down the path of reconciliation. Never before has this parliament witnessed such an appalling rejection of what was a unique opportunity to progress, both in terms of the human rights of indigenous people and as a nation which will finally, hopefully, achieve maturity and give us dignity and credibility on the international stage. Or are we John Howard's Australia, going backwards with every step?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this squandering by the Prime Minister, John Howard, that will forever position this government's place in the history books. In the parliament there has never been a greater distinction between the government and everybody else. For the first time we have a government which is not about good governance of this country. It is a government born of a narrow philosophical base of free&hyphen;market dominance, which cannot see beyond the harsh, dry remedies that it is drip&hyphen;fed. It is a government that is blind to the values of an evolving community, which is demanding that reconciliation proceed with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These values have been expressed in the phenomenal ground swell of opposition to the government's Wik package. Importantly, this grassroots campaign has encompassed far more than vehement criticism of John Howard's package. It has been presented in a positive and progressive way, and has profiled all that Australia has to gain from this next step in the reconciliation process. Regrettably, the saddest indictment of politicians from the Liberal and National parties is that their main concern is the short term. They have no interest in the long-term future of this country. They are not concerned with reconciliation. They have no vision for this generation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9632"> or for future generations. Since the election of John Howard in March last year, the government's emphasis&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will try to remember to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election of the Prime Minister in March last year, the government's emphasis has been on short-sighted bandaid solutions rather than on producing real policies that have the opportunity and the capability of projecting and propelling Australia into the next century. Every parliament is remembered for how it directs or influences Australian life. Our input into areas governing education, employment, social equity, environmental issues, economics or Australia's international role and identity remain on the public record for history to judge. Whatever the issue, it seems that the Howard government is incapable of looking beyond opinion polls for their solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party recognises that the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  is a unique opportunity for the parliament to stand up and make its mark on history. The Senate now has the opportunity to leave its mark on the future of Australia. The debate over the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  is a watershed for all Australians. How this chamber votes will dictate how Australia's history books will be written. What we decide in the Senate will also determine how the international community judges Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister's bill is passed, Australia will no longer be in a position to judge or comment with any credibility on how other countries are governed, particularly in relation to human rights. If we cannot provide justice within our own society, how can we possibly question the actions of other governments? Australia, through the Howard government, will be saying to the world, `We don't have the political will or maturity to resolve the outstanding conflict that exists between our indigenous and non-indigenous population.' Australia, through the Howard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, will be saying, `We have chosen to debate native title on a racist platform because we think that best enhances our electoral chances.' How appalling; how narrow; how short-sighted; how Howard!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reflect on the views of my generation. We grew up in the eighties. My generation is highly sceptical and increasingly cynical about those who represent us in this place. It is not surprising that people of my generation are sickened by the race card that has been so blatantly played by this government. Never before have I received such impassioned appeals from young people about the importance of effectively amending this bill. Never before have the representations been made to me in such a consistent way with such a consistent message. The e-mail, the written correspondence, being stopped in the street and the appeals of friends and family have added layer upon layer to the body of evidence that ultimately proves that this bill is not only technically flawed but also philosophically flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For younger Australians it is an embarrassment that the government can get it so wrong. Young people are angry, frustrated, saddened and disappointed that, cynical as they may be, a group of theoretically astute adults&mdash;cabinet ministers&mdash;can get it so wrong. The claims by the government that there is a misinformation campaign in place are a smokescreen. `Blame the media' is their call. `People don't understand' they bleat. This is nothing more than an insult. People understand only too well what this bill is about. This bill is basically about whether you believe in giving Australia's indigenous people the same common law rights that the rest of Australia has. The Prime Minister's package discriminates on racial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should concern senators opposite is that the very people they are refusing to listen to&mdash;indigenous Australians, historians, academics, unionists, actors, lawyers, musicians, artists, teachers and thousands of concerned Australians who have written to their representatives&mdash;are the people who will write and tell this history. This government&mdash;and I specifically refer to those senators opposite&mdash;will go down in history as the most petty, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9633"> bigoted, ignorant and mean group of politicians since Federation if they support this awful piece of legislation, which is about taking away the rights of one group simply because of the colour of their skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that former Liberal ministers Fred Chaney and Ian Viner must be horrified by the prejudice and extreme rhetoric of this government. Is it the Liberal Party they know? I think not. How many of your supporters are feeling comfortable with the position you are taking? You will be judged by future Australians, and your performance in this house will mark you as having presided over one of the most discriminatory and racist pieces of legislation that this chamber has seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the future, when our children and grandchildren study the events surrounding the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , the names of those senators who voted to extinguish native title will be recorded. But I reserve my most scathing comments for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). This minister's actions&mdash;or inactions as it turns out&mdash;will be judged by present and future Australians, and he will no doubt go down in history as the worst minister for Aboriginal affairs ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Never before have we seen a minister so willing to sell out his constituency for some perceived electoral advantage. Rather than defend a High Court decision that offered some sort of future for indigenous people, the minister would support foreign pastoral leaseholders and mining interests. For an example of the interests at play in this debate, you need look no further than the advertisement placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> just yesterday by the minerals industry entitled, `A message to ACT Senators'. Similar ads, I understand, were placed around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to the claim made in this advertisement by the minerals industry, mining exploration is not under threat by Labor's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act. Rather than wasting $8,000 on a futile advertisement, perhaps the minerals industry would have been better served by studying Labor's amendments. If there is any uncertainty&mdash;as they claim&mdash;surrounding native title, it is in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the uncertainty of mining companies to continue to make immorally large profits at the expense of Australia's race relations. Their claim that delays in resolving native title will force investment and jobs offshore is nothing more than malicious misinformation. Exploration and mining continues unabated in other countries with indigenous populations, be it New Zealand, Canada or the US, where they have ostensibly dealt with native title issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their advertisement, the minerals industry mention blocking opportunities for Australia. I question which Australian opportunities they are talking about. Perhaps they mean opportunities for Rio Tinto workers to seek fair and equitable working conditions. Or do they mean opportunities for indigenous people to continue tribal customs and laws? I think not. They are referring to the opportunities for mining companies to continue unfettered exploration and development without regard to the rights of traditional land&hyphen;holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minerals industry seriously claim to `support native title as a common law right' as quoted in the ad, they should welcome Labor's fair and equitable amendments to the bill without recourse to inflammatory and misleading statements. This industry had an opportunity to show some leadership in the void that has been left by the Prime Minister. They chose not to and they must carry this legacy with them from this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we approach a new millennium, Australia is at a crossroads. Do we go forward? Do we progress and face our future even if that means acknowledging that the past contains many horrific acts of prejudice, disenfranchisement, racism and even genocide? Should we aim for the survival and prosperity of indigenous culture alongside non&hyphen;indigenous Australia; or do we return to the 1950s and continue the myth that Australia was uninhabited before 1788?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand proudly with my Labor colleagues in refuting the Prime Minister's proposed changes contained in the Native Title Amendment Bill . Let history judge the actions of the Keating government and the Beazley Labor Party with regard to native title because our commitment is unquestionable. Our  amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9634"> ments seek to redress the deficiencies of the government's bill in a comprehensive and effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is one of those occasions where our behaviour will be remembered long after we are gone from here. Even those who have chosen to comment publicly in support of the government's Wik package outside of this place will be forever tainted with the racist brush, whilst those who have campaigned will be remembered for their strength, compassion and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to acknowledge the commitment of everyone who has taken the time to express their support for indigenous Australians&mdash;to write a letter, to take someone on in debate or conversation. You are the body politic. If Labor is successful in restoring some principle and sanity to the Native Title Act through our amendments, you too have a stake in that achievement. To Noel Pearson, Pat Dodson, Lois O'Donoghue, all the proud leaders of the indigenous Australian communities and all indigenous Australians: I am humbled by your dedication and energy and you are justified in your anger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senators opposite can choose to be remembered as being part of a progressive Senate with a social conscience and a sense of what is right and just but, under their government's proposal, they will not be able to take that course of action. I know I would be ashamed to go down in history as part of the only government to wind back the clock and return to a 19th century view of Aboriginal affairs. Everyone will be watching those opposite who make that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want my children to grow up in a society capable of bestowing justice and recognition upon our indigenous community. Effectively and comprehensively amending this bill is just another step in rebuilding Australia's future, our international reputation and the dignity and justice that our indigenous people deserve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to rise today to speak in this debate. It gives me an opportunity to reflect upon what this country has done to its indigenous people over 200 years and to try to make amends for that. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whilst I am proud to be a member of parliament and be given this great opportunity, I also feel a sense of shame that I have to deal with some of that history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was brought up in the Sutherland shire. It is an area that we call the birthplace of Australia, the birthplace of our nation. However, I do not think the indigenous people of this country have ever regarded it as the birthplace of the nation. For them, it represents the start of 200 years of loss of their rights, of their land, of their entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a young person attending primary school, all that I learnt of our indigenous people and their culture was about people like Jacky&hyphen;Jacky, the faithful blacktracker for Edmund Kennedy. I learnt about Daisy Bates. I learnt about how Aboriginal people lived on missions. I learnt about Albert Namatjira and his great talent for painting. But, of course, that was not the real history. We were never taught the real history. We were never taught what had been done to the indigenous people, as we have now come to understand from that book of shame, the stolen children report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a young person, my recognition of Aboriginal people in this country was of the sporting achievements of people like Evonne Goolagong and Lionel Rose&mdash;people who had made it in the white man's world. I went to law school in the 1970s and I remember reading a case in property law involving Nabalco. In that decision Justice Blackburn was forced to uphold the then common law doctrine of terra nullius. It was clear from his remarks in the judgment that he had great unease with that. Nevertheless, that was the law at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the doctrine of terra nullius? It was a doctrine that said that Australia was not a settled, inhabited continent and that the indigenous people who lived here when the white man came really did not own the land. They may have had an association with it, but the law said that they did not own it. The law said that because they were not a conquered people they had no rights to lose, unlike tribes in other countries and Indians in America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember thinking at the time: how could that really be the case; how could we have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9635"> legal doctrine that was a lie? Because I knew&mdash;we all knew&mdash;that the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islander people were here before us. We had come and settled this continent. When the law was saying that those prior inhabitants had no legal rights, it just did not make sense. When you think about it now, the term `terra nullius' is highly offensive. It was offensive to the prior inhabitants of this great continent. To say that they had no ownership and no real rights was to say that they had, in effect, no existence&mdash;that their occupation did not matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Mabo has changed that irrevocably. Finally, with Mabo, we had a decision which said that that doctrine was wrong, and it was revoked. With Mabo, we finally had legally recognised in this country, in the highest court in this land, the fact that the indigenous people did have prior ownership and that they continued to have native title rights. Whilst the court recognised that those native title rights were, in many cases, limited or extinguished, it nevertheless said that those native title rights existed. It became the duty of this parliament, then, to come to terms with that High Court decision and that major change in the approach that the courts had had to the indigenous people and their relationship with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government set about seeking to deal with that decision in a fair and honest way. How do we cope with the situation where, on the one hand, we had 200 years of English common law and property law based upon freehold and leasehold title and the issuing of crown land grants and, on the other hand, we had a decision that said that the indigenous people&mdash;the prior inhabitants of this land&mdash;actually had native title rights as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we get from the opposition at the time&mdash;the present government? We did not get a reaction which said, `Yes, this is a major change in the attitude to the history of this country of our indigenous people and we should sit down and work this thing out.' Rather, what we got was denial by the then opposition and many of the pastoral and mining interests of this country. Many of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them refused to accept the High Court decision, notwithstanding its six&hyphen;one majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then Premier of Western Australia&mdash;and still the Premier&mdash;Mr Richard Court, threatened and did take the legislation ultimately to the High Court. The then opposition came in here and opposed the Keating government every step of the way. They never sought to try to deal with complex issues by a process of amendment, negotiation and discussion. Rather, what did they do? They talked about the problems that would eventuate and which they clearly hoped would eventuate. They talked about how people would lose their backyards, their houses and their farms. They never once sought to try, firstly, to respect the decision of the highest court in this land and, secondly, to assist in dealing with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when the government now criticises the Keating government for the problems that have eventuated from the Native Title Act and, more particularly, the issues that have now been clearly put on the table to be addressed as a result of the Wik decision, I say to the government today: it was your failing back then to cooperate that has, in many ways, led us to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, today the opposition is prepared&mdash;and has been prepared all along&mdash;to work with the government and to work with all groups to ensure that we properly, honestly, openly and fairly, without discrimination, address the Wik decision. That is why, when we get into the committee stage, we will be proposing many amendments in order to pass a bill in this Senate which does justice to the indigenous people, which respects their rights as given to them in Mabo and Wik and at the same time deals with the complexities and issues that arise that affect the pastoral industry in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned that even today as we embark upon this debate the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, is still trying to peddle that scare tactic that people are threatened with losing their houses&mdash;their freehold title. Why does the government continue to say this? Because it knows that its own legislation has significant flaws, that it is unjust, that it does contradict our international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9636"> obligations and that it is likely to fail the constitutional test in the High Court. It seems to me that many people on the government side and their supporters still have not accepted Mabo or Wik. They still think that we should really go back to terra nullius. They would be happy if we still had that regime in place, but we do not. It is about time they realised that and came to terms with what the High Court has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In preparation for this debate, I have been reading through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of speeches by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other members of the coalition. I cannot find anywhere a speech where the Prime Minister or senior ministers have actually got up and in a pro-active way talked about the rights of the indigenous people in this country. Rather, every time they get up to speak, every time they have something to say, it is reactive. Very often it sounds like they are trying to find problems and trying to drag the reputation of our indigenous people down. When they talk about ATSIC, they do not talk about the fact that this was an attempt to give the indigenous people of this country legal control over their own destiny. Rather, they go out and seek problems and then try to highlight them to discredit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's reaction to Mabo was not to say what a great demonstration of justice and reconciliation this High Court decision was and how finally the High Court had given legal recognition to the indigenous people of their ownership and previous occupation of land, and had destroyed once and for all a legal fiction. Their reaction was not to stand up and say, `What a great decision&mdash;what a great social justice decision this finally is.' Their approach was to stand up and say, `This is going to cause the farmers and the miners a lot of problems.' The focus is always on the negative. They adopted the same attitude to the stolen children report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with all that evidence, our Prime Minister could still not bring himself to apologise. Rather, he said that it was not his fault, that he was not personally responsible and that he did not subscribe to a black-armband view of history. They are all negative reactions. The Prime Minister failed to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respond to the outrageous remarks of the member for Oxley, who said that she would come into this parliament and have the great privilege of being a member of this parliament but would not represent the indigenous people. What a disgraceful attitude! But the Prime Minister was silent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet when Noel Pearson makes some comments about the Prime Minister or the government out of frustration, Mr Howard is very quickly in there to respond. When the churches stand up and say to the government, `You've got it wrong; stop and think,' the Prime Minister and others on the government side are quick to jump in and attack the bishops and the church leaders of this country. They have the hide to say that this is none of the churches' business and they should stick to preaching in the churches and not comment upon issues such as Wik. I agree with one thing that Senator O'Chee said this morning, and only one: this is an issue about morality. And the church leaders had a right to stand up for the indigenous people as much as anyone else had that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister says that he is a Christian. I accept that he is and I accept that he fervently holds his Christian beliefs. My knowledge of Christianity is that the greatest act of Christianity was the crucifixion, when Christ gave his life for the sins&mdash;past, present and future&mdash;of mankind. If Christ could do that, the least the Prime Minister could have done as a Christian was to apologise for the sins and injustices visited upon our indigenous people. I want to take this opportunity to express my profound sorrow and regret and apology for what was done by our forebears to the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by making some comments about the Wik decision. Whilst there may have been understandings based upon the obiter dicta of the chief justice at the time in Mabo regarding whether or not native title rights were extinguished on pastoral leases, the fact of the matter is that the High Court in the Wik decision determined that native title rights were not automatically nor necessarily extinguished by pastoral leases. Notwithstanding the fact that it was a close decision&mdash;four to three&mdash;it was nevertheless 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9637"> a decision of the High Court of this country. It was a decision that we as a parliament and a nation must accept, respect and deal with. We must recognise that High Court decision and deal with it appropriately by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believe in the rule of law, which so many people in the government tell us is one of the reasons why they support our current constitution and British heritage, you must accept it. It is no response to simply attack the judges of the High Court, as many members of the government have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an overwhelming body of opinion which believes that this legislation is unconstitutional and that it breaches the Racial Discrimination Act. The government have advice to that effect, but of course they refuse to release it. I call upon the government to accept the fact that with Mabo and with Wik, with the 1967 referendum and with the Aboriginal stockmen case, we have in recent years attempted to come to terms with that sad history of this country and we have attempted to give proper recognition to the rights of our indigenous people. I ask them to rethink this legislation, accept the amendments that will be moved by the opposition and work towards better legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that at the moment the eyes of the people of this country&mdash;and, indeed, the eyes of the people of the world&mdash;are upon us. This is an issue that does interest people throughout the world. Their eyes will, of course, also be upon us in the year 2000 when we have the great privilege of hosting the Olympic Games which will usher in the new millennium. Just as Olympic Games in other cities are a celebration of the history and the culture of a country&mdash;in particular, a celebration of the culture of the indigenous people of those countries&mdash;we will also seek to do the same. There is no doubt that we will want to demonstrate to the world the wonderful indigenous culture of Australia and the heritage of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. But we have no right to do that unless we now also respect their rights, their history and their culture and we give effect to the justice of the Mabo and Wik decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Senate and I thank the people of Australia, particularly the indigenous people

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although time prevents my addressing at length the human rights and natural justice aspects of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I will state that I am someone who has lived through some of this century's most shameful and turbulent periods of race struggle. I refer to South Africa and Zimbabwe and the struggle in those countries between powerful elites seeking to maintain their privileged positions and the ordinary people of those countries seeking recognition of their humanity and the rights that are necessarily attached to that humanity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall being the only boy in the boarding school at Fort Victoria&mdash;now Masvingo&mdash;who opposed the Rhodesian Front. Being a supporter of human rights&mdash;of justice for the black peoples of Rhodesia&mdash;was not exactly a popular white pastime in those days. The Rhodesian Front, later led by Ian Smith, believed in the dominance of whites over blacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When at university in South Africa I had the benefit of meeting and working with leaders of the black consciousness and black power movements. In those days progressive and liberal whites&mdash;small `l', not the conservative large `l' version here in Australia&mdash;used to speak and act for blacks, a kind of white progressive paternalism. It was Steve Biko in particular, whom I was privileged to know, who broke that mould and encouraged a mass movement of empowered blacks to speak out for themselves. He taught me the value of speaking `along with' the people's movement as opposed to speaking `for' them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia fortunately has large numbers of empowered indigenous people who are strong advocates of human rights and justice. In this native title debate they have been well to the fore. It is a privilege for me both personally and as an Australian Democrat to be a small part of their campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing I learned from those days of  struggle in southern Africa, it is that whatever perceived benefit powerful elites think they gain from denying whole popula 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9638"> tions their full human rights, those benefits are fleeting and come at an enormous cost to everyone, including those elites themselves. I confess that I never expected that at this stage in its history Australia would find itself embroiled in another damaging conflict on race matters. I deeply regret that this situation has arisen. No-one should underestimate the international impact this has. It is my fervent hope that this government will not lead us towards the status of international pariah on race matters. No-one should underestimate the effect that being an international pariah has on a country and its peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not for one moment believe that we needed to have a conflict of this kind. Recognition of the rights of Australia's indigenous people did not have to be such a traumatic and divisive process. It could and should have been a process distinguished by generosity and celebration, not one which includes dishonesty, narrow&hyphen;mindedness, selfishness and greed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rights of indigenous peoples are an international concern. Across the world indigenous peoples and their cultures are being lost or placed under enormous pressure, quite often as a result of repressive governments working hand in hand with powerful economic forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is abundantly clear now that the indigenous peoples of Australia feel that their struggle for survival and recognition is being directly undermined by the Howard government's 10&hyphen;point plan. The indigenous people of Australia do support a number of needed reforms proposed by the government to the management and processing of claims under the native title system. But they oppose racially discriminatory provisions in the bill and the erosion or extinguishment of hard&hyphen;won rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who would presume to tell indigenous people that their 200 years of experience with us do not give them a very clear insight into the workings of non-Aboriginal political and economic forces and what the effects of decisions made by those elites will be on their people and their culture? The Prime Minister and his supporters have drastically overstated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their case. There is profound suspicion as to their motives and attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commissioner Michael Dodson reflected on the Deputy Prime Minister's proud boast that this bill delivers `buckets of extinguishment' when Mr Dodson delivered his native title report to the Attorney&hyphen;General in 1997. He said the 10&hyphen;point plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . cuts away at the protection of native title and delivers extinguishment and impairment of native title `bucket by bucket'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The legality of the bill was considered by the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The bill is flawed on constitutional grounds, and it does not enjoy the consent of the indigenous people, which is a prime consideration in determining whether the bill breaches the races power. The bill needs heavy amendment and, when it is amended, it will be the consent of the Aboriginal representative groups at large which will determine whether the amended act will have acceptance in the community from the point of view of the races power in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is self&hyphen;evident, I believe, that the issue of Aboriginal consent to this law will contribute materially to the attitude of the High Court to any challenge to this bill designed to overturn it. It is in the interests of all those affected to arrive at an amended bill which enjoys consent, acceptance and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Mabo decision, Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines were dispossessed of their land, parcel by parcel, to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Their dispossession underwrote the development of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Native Title Act did not reverse or redress that dispossession. At best it arrested dispossession by introducing a limited form of land rights&mdash;coexistence and native title&mdash;for the indigenous people. The outrage expressed domestically and internationally is that the coalition government seeks to undermine these limited rights. It is seen as further dispossession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about the economic forces driving the Howard government in this bill. There are provisions in the bill in relation to the management and processing of claims that contribute to improved threshold tests, more effective procedures, and greater fair 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9639"> ness and efficiency. Much of the intent behind such provisions has the support of indigenous and non-indigenous groups at large. Then there are the other provisions, most of which are driven by an economic agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One characteristic of modern industrial and corporate organisations is their resistance to limitation or restraint. Their drive is for development, expansion and growth. Some see native title as an impediment to those economic forces. The economic agenda is a tangible one, and it is measured by money and control. `Workable', to those economic forces, means being capable of compliance with their growth and development imperatives. Those economic forces are always in a hurry. Delays caused by negotiation cost money, and agreements place limits on operations. To them, logic dictates making negotiations and agreements as quick, cheap and easy as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for those who focus on the economic agenda is that cultural, spiritual, historical and emotional attachments&mdash;native title&mdash;require a different mind&hyphen;set: an attention to intangibles. This bill fails to reconcile the two opposing forces and intentions, and that is why there is such a clash of wills in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with `workable', the other great code word of this government is `certainty'. In order to achieve&mdash;or should I say buy&mdash;certainty, the Prime Minister has stated that he is prepared to pay 75 per cent of the cost of compensating Aboriginal peoples for the expropriation or extinguishment of their native title on pastoral leases. On top of the 75 per cent to be paid by the public via the Commonwealth, the remaining 25 per cent will be paid for by the public via the states. In other words, the myth of certainty is to be achieved through a 100 per cent taxpayer funded blank cheque&mdash;a bottomless pit of financial uncertainty for the Australian community. I would like to ask: how much are this government and the various state governments that are supporting the Howard government's 10&hyphen;point plan prepared to spend in extinguishing native title, and in effectively privatising some 40 per cent of Australia?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rick Farley, former executive director of the National Farmers Federation, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 10 May 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's pretty clever politics because in effect what the pastoralists have done is use native title as an excuse to run an argument which is likely to improve their rights, and have that funded by the taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I now wish to focus on Western Australian pastoral leases. According to the 1992 Western Australian state of the environment report, pastoral leases make up 85 per cent of Western Australia's total agricultural lands, and contribute about four per cent of total agricultural production. There are 561 Western Australian pastoral leases, covering most of Western Australia. Some of the persons and companies who own these leases are wealthy, others are not. I am advised that one&hyphen;quarter of these Western Australian leases are operated by indigenous interests. Of the remaining 400&hyphen;odd leases, a number are owned and operated by hardworking Western Australian families. But some are owned by absentee landlords, some are owned by foreigners and some are owned by residents of other Australian states. Some are multiple leaseholders. I am told, but have been unable to verify, that one Perth based pastoral lease owner has 34 leases out of the 561. If that were true it would be shocking. A minor monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a few hundred pastoral leaseholders, some exceedingly wealthy and powerful and others not, with an iron grip over the majority of Western Australia, are the focus of all this effort by the coalition. Why? I think, as usual with the coalition, that the answer is money&mdash;lots of it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would expect, those few hundred pastoral leaseholders are well connected politically and commercially. The President of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia is Premier Court's brother. How many of Premier Court's native title advisers and consultants, and the lawyers advising his government, have connections with that industry or with agricultural interests generally? We have asked the questions, but they will not give the answers. We are left with the suspicion of conflicts of interest and unhealthy self&hyphen;interest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9640">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron, in answer to my question on notice No. 568, explained that the total rental income to the Western Australian community from pastoral leaseholders in 1996&hyphen;97 was $497,885.84. Given that the total area of pastoral leases in Western Australia is 94,360,000 hectares, this amounts to an annual rental income of about half a cent per hectare. As Senator Herron also advised me, expenditure by the state of Western Australia in administering and maintaining our 561 pastoral leases was $156,000 by the Pastoral Board plus $10.3 million by the Department of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the Western Australian public expends over $10 million dollars annually in supporting the pastoral industry and receives back, in the form of rent, a mere half a million dollars. And now the public are meant to pay multimillions more in compensation to allow pastoralists hugely enhanced property rights, together with the potential gift of freehold. Why? Whose sticky hands are in this big deal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the nasty possibility that this bill  deliberately presents an opportunity for land laundering; it is like money laundering, only with land. It goes like this. The bill will allow crown land with native title that is transferred from one government agency to another crown agency to extinguish native title. Then that transferred crown land will be sold or leased to private interests, native title free. Is this a swindle, or is it just incompetence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are now being confronted with by this government is the triple bypass. On top of ongoing taxpayer subsidies to pastoralists on peppercorn rents, we face new massive compensation payouts on behalf of pastoral leaseholders for the expropriation of native title. On top of this, some pastoral leaseholders stand to make massive windfall profits from upgrading their title. In a great understatement, Rick Farley said that the Howard 10&hyphen;point plan would provide a `significant windfall for pastoralists'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope the public debate now shifts to the morality of whether that sort of improvement in tenure resulting in financial gain for pastoralists should be funded by the public. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This deal&mdash;this proposed massive, costly and open-ended transfer of rights from the Australian public to a few hundred Western Australian pastoral leaseholders&mdash;makes a mockery of the Howard government's claims to fairness, fiscal responsibility and sound economic management. It would make much more sense all round to spend a fraction of the compensation budget on facilitating coexistence agreements between pastoral lessees and traditional owners, and thus resurrect the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with a quote from Mr Gatjil Djerrkura on 23 January 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coexistence of rights is at the heart of reconciliation, along with respect for different values and acceptance that different sectors of the community can share resources with beneficial results. . . If (Aboriginal) communities are to make headway towards developing economic opportunities and achieving self&hyphen;empowerment, we need to have confidence that mainstream systems will work equally in our interests as they do for non-indigenous Australians. . . No indigenous person will agree to the surrender of our rights as the fee for acceptance by the wider community, and no-one truly committed to reconciliation would seek that transaction from us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am an optimist about this bill. I am an optimist because I believe it will be so heavily amended that this Senate will pass a bill which will meet the needs of the indigenous peoples and the non&hyphen;indigenous peoples of Australia and achieve their consent. If the Senate does not arrive at a heavily amended bill, we are going to have serious problems with its constitutionality and with the community at large. I look forward to great success with the amendments that are to come.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  introduced into the Senate on Tuesday is the fulfilment of another coalition election commitment to provide balance, fairness and certainty to the common law right of native title conferred by the High Court in Mabo and Wik. For the misinformed, be aware: we are building on Mabo and Wik, not dismantling the common law rights thereby conferred. The Native Title Act has simply not delivered for Aboriginal Australians or for the rest of Australia. As legislators, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9641"> our aim must be to make laws that are in the interests of all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have over 660 native title claims in the process of being registered. Many of these overlap, many of them are mere ambit claims, many of them unfortunately have about as much voracity as Hindmarsh Island, many of them are dividing Aboriginal communities themselves and many are raising expectations that can never be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has only been one determination of native title on Australian mainland, at Crescent Head on the north coast of New South Wales. It cannot go without comment that the day after this native title was confirmed, the local land council sold part of the land. So much for the importance of the land. Any observer can only conclude that the money was clearly a more acceptable right of passage. The Native Title Act has simply not delivered. And if the ALP would talk to Aboriginal people on the ground, they would discover that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that came the High Court's decision in Wik, which has now more than doubled the area of Australia subject to possible native title claims. Something simply had to be done. In developing this bill before the Senate, the government has had exhaustive negotiations with all the competing interests. The process of discussion has been carried out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), Senator Minchin, who is in the chamber, and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Prime Minister for the spirit of goodwill in which he has battled the forces of ignorance, or worse, to get this result. It has been a painstaking approach to achieve a real compromise. He has run a gauntlet of misinformed and bloody&hyphen;minded interest groups, disingenuous churchmen and opposition spokesmen like the shadow Aboriginal affairs minister, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who appears incapable of understanding what has gone before in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess he is not alone in that, however, when you bear in mind the universal acknowledgment&mdash;including by the Labor Party then in government&mdash;that, prior to Wik, native title was extinguished by a valid pastoral lease. That was the genuine opinion of almost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> everybody, especially the Labor government. For the uninformed, extinguishment does not mean that no monetary compensation is payable to Aboriginal claimants. They continue to have that right, as occurs in the loss of any other common law right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In developing the bill, the government has had four objectives. The first is to reduce uncertainty. Senator Faulkner, the other day, accused us of using certainty as a platitude. I remind the Senate that in 1993 the Labor legislation had about as much certainty as an ALP preselection: the certainty of a deal done here and a deal done there. The other objectives of the bill are to improve the workability of the native title process; to find a balance amongst the interests of all parties; and to maintain respect for native title, the native title claimants and the High Court's decision in both Mabo and Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to ensuring that the Native Title Amendment Bill provides a process for dealing with native title which is both fair and equitable to everyone in Australia. The fact that criticism has come from both the left and the right means we must have got it pretty right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recall that the Wik decision was a base 4:3 decision of the High Court, with Chief Justice Brennan being in the minority but giving what he seemingly expected to be the majority judgment. Remember it was he who gave the lead judgment in Mabo, so the judge that gave us Mabo did not support Wik. People cannot it both ways&mdash;even Mr Justice Brennan thought that a valid pastoral lease extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is in the interests of all of us, and those special interest groups who have tried to paint our Prime Minister or the government as racists should go and read the facts and stop measuring themselves up for a new outfit of sackcloth and ashes. They are the people who are not acting in the best interests of Australia. They are the people damaging the so&hyphen;called reconciliation process. They are the people alienating the vast majority of average Australians struggling with a mortgage and being bombarded with infor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9642"> mation which makes them feel guilty for something when that is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things about Australians is that commonsense generally prevails. Commonsense will prevail in this turbulent debate because, despite the froth and bubble, what we are proposing is a fair solution and it is fair dinkum. Our response is a hell of a lot more fair dinkum than the reaction of the likes of the Body Shop's&mdash;what a stunt that is&mdash;or the American glitz reaction of Nicole Kidman.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely right. These are un&hyphen;Australian reactions, make no mistake about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take issue with one of the most regrettable comments in this debate made by Mr Noel Pearson, accusing this government of being `racist scum'. I ask this ambit claim agitator: just who is the recipient of the High Court's decision to grant a type of title on the basis of somebody's claimed race? The answer is that he is, and it is based on his race. So my advice to Mr Pearson is to cut out the humbug and the offensive language. To see the people in this government, whom I know to be people of intelligence, compassion and good will, labelled racist scum removes Mr Pearson from the envelope of courtesy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People would recall that it was our clear election policy that, on coming to government, we would amend the Native Title Act to improve workability, and that in doing so we would respect the principle of the Racial Discrimination Act. We have done that. It needs to be said repeatedly that the cost of this native title debate is not being borne in Sydney and Melbourne; it is being borne in regional Australia. The High Court's Wik decision simply increased the need to amend and improve the original Native Title Act, given the uncertainty it created in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers and Aboriginal people have coexisted at grassroots level for decades. That point was made so clear by my colleague Senator Boswell. I challenge the blinkered 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> observers of this debate to acknowledge this reality. Many native title promoters seek much more than customary native title rights. They are frauds and the community is a wake&hyphen;up to these people. Native title is for traditional use of tribal land&mdash;simple. Unfortunately, it now tends to be all about money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original Native Title Act was a dog's breakfast. Those who were around in 1993 would recall that there were around 200 amendments, most of them from the then Labor government, when the bill arrived in the Senate&mdash;what a vote of no confidence by the government of the day on its own legislation. After it was passed, Labor never had the fortitude, or the bravery or the foresight, to attempt any further improvement. It was just too hard for the Keating government, which sat pat while mining companies pushed their exploration budgets overseas and away from working Australia's jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Arvi Parbo, a great Australian in anybody's view, said the following, earlier this week, as part of the report he gave to the annual general meeting of Western Mining:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is regrettable that most of our grass roots minerals exploration effort is at present taking place outside Australia; in the current financial year only 15% of WMC's greenfields exploration budget is spent in Australia. This is not because we do not wish to explore at home&mdash;our past record proves otherwise&mdash;but because of the current uncertainty and confusion about exploration and mining titles in Australia. While no country is without problems in this area, Australia has lost its previous high standing in terms of predictability of conditions and security of titles.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a very damming legacy of the original native title legislation and the reason why something has to be done very soon, in fact immediately, to fix it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the time farmers and pastoralists have remained in a state of false misunderstanding, having taken Mr Keating's and Senator Evans's word that their leases were secure. Mr Keating's government and Labor was and is duplicitous in many ways. None more so than in the context of their approach to native title then and now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bill implements those amendments to the Native Title Act developed under the 10&hyphen;point plan. It allows for the ability of govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9643"> ments to regulate and manage surface and subsurface water, offshore resources and air space for the benefit of everybody. It provides for the validation of acts or grants on pastoral leases, or other coexisting tenures, between 1 January 1994, when the native title bill came to effect and the day of the Wik decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides for the confirmation of extinguishment of native title on leaseholds that confer exclusive tenures. It confirms the High Court's Wik decision, ruling that pastoral lessees' statutory rights prevail over any surviving native title rights. It ensures that lessees, subject to proved coexisting native title rights, can be granted additional primary production rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill confirms existing access by native title claimants to pastoral leases. It provides a more effective and efficient regime for the consideration of mining applications on land where native title may exist. It ensures equivalent treatment for native title claimants and pastoralists in relation to mining and other developments on pastoral leases. It provides more efficient management of native title claims by raising the threshold test, requiring one of the claimed groups to have had regular physical connection to the land claimed for traditional purposes. It provides for the opportunity for legal assistance to be provided to pastoralists, as well as to Aboriginal claimants, in settling uncertainties that may continue. It provides for a sunset clause to native title claims, so that claims cannot be made for ever and a day, the limit being six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government has agreed to fund a test case for New South Wales western division leaseholders to determine whether these leases confer exclusive tenure and extinguish native title. This is necessary because Premier Carr turned his back on western division leaseholders, refusing to place that category of pastoral lease in division four of the bill. It must be reiterated, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the federal government was unable to include these leases in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  because the New South Wales government refused to schedule them and subsequent legal advice could not confirm exclusivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill respects native title. It increases certainty for all parties and will ensure a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much better legislative framework for dealing with native title claims. Informed opinion, as distinct from much of the comment that has been made, has commended the government on its attempt to find a fair solution to the problem it inherited. All state premiers, even Premier Carr privately I am reliably advised, support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week a number of groups of leading and fair-minded business representatives have advertised their support for our position. I note that Mr Kerry O'Brien and his ABC colleagues did not invite them to give their view. Why not? Because it does not reinforce the distorted agenda that organisation is running. These leading Australians are not fools and they are not self&hyphen;appointed cultural dietitians. They are informed and decent realists, unlike many other agitators, lawyers on the payroll and other commentators who do not understand native title&mdash;do not understand the way it has worked, do not understand what amendments are proposed and have never, I would suggest, met an indigenous Australian in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a letter from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies. It is a letter sent to all MPs and senators and is a balanced view in support of this legislation. The letter, talking about the existing native title legislation, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the existing Native Title Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is in its present form a nonsense and must be effectively and fairly amended or Australia will continue to suffer. The current amending bill will correct many of the existing problems and is a significant improvement on the current Native Title Act. AMEC therefore supports the government's initiative and the government's amendments. The fear campaign being waged by some interest groups and some politicians is reprehensible in that it aims to protect special privileges which have been demonstrated to be able to be misused. Even the churches are now having a say on an issue on which they have been silent for four years. The only people who are not having a say are ordinary Australians who are relatively silent. They are, however, the ones who will ultimately bear the brunt of the problem on a reduced economy. Australia stands to lose a great deal if the Native Title Act is not made more commercially sensitive. The reality is that future investment could easily go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9644"> elsewhere and in that process further jobs will be lost. The parliament, however, is the final arbiter of this whole matter. With great respect, AMEC suggests that it is imperative, therefore, that the parliament realises its great responsibility to get it right and to judge this matter free of bias, rather than from a narrow political viewpoint. AMEC appeals to the parliament to put native title into perspective once and for all, free of the emotions, the self&hyphen;serving politics, the ideology and tangled philosophy which native title seems to generate. Australia's interests must be put first.</PARA>

The Labor Party has indicated that it will oppose that confirmation provision in the bill, even the confirmation that freehold has extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question on the other hand that should be asked of the Labor Party is: why is the Labor Party not prepared to support that part of the bill that states that freehold has extinguished native title? The only rational reason for their position is that they think that native title can coexist with freehold. If Labor are successful with their amendments, claims will be able to be made over freehold land in the Federal Court. We think they will fail, but whilst generally the High Court has said that freehold extinguishes native title, it has not decided a case directly on this issue and that is fact. It has not decided a case directly on this issue. Chief Justice Brennan of the High Court commented in Wik that, if native title is simply suppressed rather than extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease, then in logic this could be the same for freehold grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is that the enormous cost and social division of adversarial litigation on claims over freehold and other exclusive possession leases should be avoided. The question, therefore, as I said before, should be asked of Labor. If it thinks freehold grants extinguish native title, why is it opposing the provision in the bill which confirms this? Why is it opposing it? We should not forget that in 1993 Labor insisted that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases and Senator Collins has confirmed that, just as former Senator Richardson did. They believed that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. They were wrong then and could be just as wrong now. What we are seeking is certainty. Senator Faulkner should be asked the question: why does Labor not support the government's amendments in this regard?</PARA>

It is a very positive document that clearly outlines the progress being made in reconciliation and the way forward. It is true that there are some in the community who argue that reconciliation is under threat. I do not accept that proposition.

The Prime Minister has on a number of occasions dedicated the coalition to continuing the reconciliation process as an integral part of our commitment to a fairer and more just society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three essential elements in achieving a lasting reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. First, there needs to be an honest and realistic acknowledgment of the injustices of the past. Second, there needs to be a mutual acceptance of the importance of working together in ensuring that our differences do not prevent us from sharing equally in a common future. Third, there needs to be a shared commitment to overcoming indigenous disadvantage and providing equality of opportunity for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government believes that reconciliation must lead to justice and equity for all. Australia is a decent and harmonious nation with a society fundamentally based on fairness, on appreciation of racial and cultural diversity, on tolerance and mutual respect. This government is committed to upholding these values. Indigenous Australians are a vitally important part of this society and those of us whose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> origins lie elsewhere should never lose sight of that fact. It is also important to stress that this government's commitment to reconciliation goes beyond just words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have adopted a practical approach to indigenous affairs and are concentrating our efforts on the five key areas indigenous Australians have identified as crucial to equality of opportunity. They are: health, housing, education, employment and economic development. This year alone we are spending $1.6 billion on indigenous specific programs and will spend over $400 million more in real terms in our first four years than Labor did in their last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted to read the Labor Party's policy platform on indigenous affairs which was released last week. Much of the policy platform put forward by Labor on indigenous affairs is identical to the policy direction we are actively and enthusiastically pursuing. I look forward to their future support for our policies. Let me give senators a few examples. Labor's platform says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic development is a key to achieving improved social and economic outcomes and self-determination for indigenous Australians as a lasting reality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course the government is enthusiastically pursuing economic development as the key to improved social and economic programs. We have set up a $120 million, four year indigenous business incentive program to achieve just that. There are many other areas where Labor has looked at what we are doing and has decided&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;that our direction is the right one. In Labor's platform we also find:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accountability must apply with equal rigour to all agencies expending public funds in this area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course this government has rigorously pursued greater accountability.

He got rolled, and I will not remind him of how that was editorialised at the time.

It has been estimated that it would be a carbon tax that would call in about $2 billion a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the effect of that? It would add to the cost of doing business in this country, it would make us less competitive and it would have a negative effect on jobs. Therefore, let us get it straight, Senator Brown, you might want a carbon tax, Labor might want a carbon tax, the Democrats definitely want a carbon tax, but this government will not be introducing a carbon tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other part of Senator Brown's question there is an issue of some merit&mdash;although that is rare. That issue is that, if we can reduce the rate of land clearing, we can make a significant difference in our emissions and, therefore, a useful contribution to a better global outcome. The figures for 1990, as I recall them, had about 24 per cent of our emissions resulting from land clearing. The last inventory published showed that that had reduced to about 17 per cent. What Senator Brown would not want to acknowledge is that the rate of land clearing in this country is reducing. If it can continue to reduce, that will play a further significant part in achieving a better emissions bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown might not understand it, but it is the objective of the government to include land issues&mdash;in our instance, principally land clearing&mdash;within the outcome of the Kyoto process, so that we can get due credit for that change, which is improving our net emissions level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, yes, there are two sides to this equation. The first is the need to reduce emissions where that can responsibly be done. Methods to achieve that goal have been announced by the Prime Minister. Senator Brown wants to go further into the irresponsible, in our view. The other side of the equation is that we can increase our level of plantation forests. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plan to treble our plantation forests by the year 2020, which will make a significant improvement on the side of sinks, which has the same effect as reducing emissions. If we can continue to reduce land clearance, we can make a significant improvement in that area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is true that we approach this on a comprehensive basis&mdash;all sources, all gases and all sinks&mdash;and we believe the real test should be the bottom line.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this does give me the opportunity to reinforce the answers that have been given by my colleagues today on this subject. What we are seeking to do in this legislation is to remove all doubt. After what has occurred in relation to pastoral leases, it is not possible for the Labor Party to stand here today and say that it is unnecessary to remove all doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All you need to do is refer to the wise words of former Senator Evans, a political silk, who told us in 1993 that pastoral leases extinguished native title and that the authority for that was the High Court. Now we find, after Wik, that that is not so. In other words, in relation to pastoral leases the Labor Party misunderstood the decision of the High Court, and now action is necessary to clarify the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to us on this side of the chamber that certainty is a small price to pay in this legislation to remove all doubt. Why then wouldn't the Labor Party stand here with us and say, `We will ensure that we do not make again the same mistake as we made in 1993. We will join with the government in this instance and remove it from all doubt.' There is still a great deal of ambiguity&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the measures to prevent franking credit trading the Government announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget the introduction of a holding period for shares known as the 45&hyphen;day rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining whether shares are held for the requisite holding period, days during which there is in place a risk diminution arrangement are not counted. Following consultation with interested parties the rule was modified so that relevant risk diminution arrangements are those where a high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9658"> level of both the upside and the downside of equity risk is removed. The mechanism for identifying these arrangements is the concept of delta. Delta, a well recognised financial concept, is a measurement of the relative change in the price of an option or other derivative for a given (small) change in the price of an underlying asset. The franking credit trading measures seek to restrict the benefits of imputation to the true economic owners of shares. The net delta concept in this context provides a financial measure of the extent of that economic ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As explained in the Treasurer's Press Release of 8 August 1997 (No. 89), I confirm that where the net equity risk is such that the net delta of a financial derivative is less than 0.7 (so that, broadly speaking, the taxpayer's effective equity risk in respect of the relevant shares is 0.3 or more per share) the arrangement will not attract the risk diminution aspect of the 45&hyphen;day rule. In other words, if the net delta of the position comprising the related derivatives and shares is thirty per cent or more, the arrangement will not attract the risk diminution aspect of the 45&hyphen;day rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the 45&hyphen;day rule and employee share schemes, if the employee share scheme is structured in such a way that there is a risk diminution arrangement then the 45&hyphen;day rule could apply. However, the Treasurer explained in his Press Release that there will be an exemption from the rule and some of the other franking credit trading measures for `eligible' employee share schemes. I refer Senator O'Brien to the Press Release for what constitutes an `eligible' employee share scheme. This exemption applies irrespective of whether or not the employer is wholly owned by non&hyphen;residents.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9658"><TITLE>Small Business</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bob Collins today, relating to freehold land and native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Over the past 24 hours we have seen the Howard government sink to a new low in their disgraceful attempts to divide this nation. What we have seen in question time today is a government that is really rattled. The performance of Senator Minchin and Senator Vanstone in question time today absolutely confirms that this is a government that has been panicked by the tide of public opinion&mdash;panicked by the fact that public opinion is turning against them. It is turning against the government's narrow minded and racially discriminatory approach to native title. The government is rattled; it has hit the panic button.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had an indication today from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) that he is not willing to come in and make a contribution on this most important piece of legislation. We now know after question time today that the same is true of Senator Vanstone and Senator Hill&mdash;perhaps for different reasons. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser </EMPHASIS> talks about what has occurred with the moderates in the Liberal Party. Let me quote the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several coalition Mps have deliberately avoided speaking on the Wik legislation in parliament because they are uncomfortable with elements of the 10&hyphen;point plan. They include senior South Australian moderate Senator Amanda Vanstone and Senator Robert Hill, neither of whom are listed to speak in favour of the bill in the Senate. Sources told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  of growing frustration among 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moderate Mps over the tone of the native title debate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they were frustrated before today, they would be really frustrated now, having seen the performance of the government's ministers in the Senate today. In the last 24 hours we have had Senator Minchin, who is the Prime Minister's loyal henchman on native title, stoop to crass, baseless and shameful scaremongering. He really ought to be condemned for what he said. Senator Minchin is no longer just an apparatchik for the Liberal Party; he is a minister in the government. He is no longer just a party hack, an anonymous back bench coalition senator; he is the Prime Minister's appointed spokesperson on native title. According to Senator Minchin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't yet know for a fact that native title can revive where there has been freehold. We understand from the High Court that freehold extinguishes native title, but there hasn't been an actual test case on a claim on freehold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, there has been an actual test case, Senator Minchin; in fact, there have been two. In both the Mabo case in 1992 and the Wik case in 1996 the High Court found 7&hyphen;0, seven&hyphen;zip, that freehold extinguishes native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time that Senator Minchin has been whipping up discord and division, it has been revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, was in the same game as early as April this year. The Deputy Prime Minister's office was writing to constituents sowing doubt about their property rights over their own backyard. When invited to remove those doubts last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, Senator Minchin chose not to. He chose to ignore unanimous High Court decisions on this matter. What he did was jump into the mire of prejudice, discord and misleading half&hyphen;truths. The government stands condemned for that. I think they have been exposed in question time in the Senate today for what they are: a rattled government with a rattled front bench who deserve to be condemned for this scaremongering in the Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a pathetic contribution following a fairly pathetic attempt by the Labor Party during question time. I rise because it included a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9662"> misrepresentation of my personal position on this matter. In actual fact, I asked that ministers and others come off the list because it seemed that we had too many speakers when there were 600 amendments pending to be dealt with in the committee stage. However, if I take that as an invitation for ministers to come back onto the list, I will be pleased to do so, because it will mean that the debate is likely to go into the week after next and, regrettably, I will not be here that week in any event. Anyway, Senator Faulkner, if you have now invited us to come back onto the list, we will be pleased to have the opportunity to do so. We thought we were facilitating the reasonable requirements of the Senate by restricting our speakers' list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course I support this bill and Senator Vanstone supports this bill. I have said in this place that the government needed to respond to the Wik decision in the same way that Labor felt it needed to respond to the Mabo decision. These decisions of the High Court, although they might have answered some questions, have left so many areas unanswered, so many areas uncertain, that it would be irresponsible of any government not to seek to legislate a more certain regime. What we have sought to do with the Wik legislation, as it is being referred to, is in fact to reflect the position of the High Court in legislative terms to provide that certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has meant that we have had to interpret that decision and seek to codify it, and there is legitimate room to debate around the edges as to whether we have got the lines right. We believe we have. We put in a lot of effort in consulting and discussing this matter with all interested parties Australia wide. What we sought was a fair and just compromise that would provide certainty for all Australians. Those who may have an interest in title, those who may have a commercial interest, such as miners&mdash;all needed to know where they stand for the future. That is what that piece of legislation is all about. It is disgraceful&mdash;it is worse than that, it is sad&mdash;that some, for their political motives, have sought to describe it in racist terms in an effort to try and win a political point. It is shameful that there are those within our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community who take a serious matter such as this and a serious attempt by a government to responsibly codify the High Court's decision and accuse the government of base racial motives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still so many issues that relate to questions of leases and even freehold. Applications for native title over freehold, as I understand it, are still being lodged. It is no good saying to those people, `You can go and fight it out in the courts, because former senator Gareth Evans says that you are on solid ground.' He told us in 1993 that pastoralists were on solid ground. These people are entitled to certainty as well. Labor says to us, `They can be confident, after they have been dragged through the courts, that they will win, because we believe that freehold extinguishes native title.' We believe that freehold extinguishes native title as well, but the point is that these people are entitled to certainty, and to legislate to confirm the position which we believe to be true under the common law can only be described as sensible legislative practice. That is what we are seeking to do&mdash;to provide that certainty by confirming those cases where we believe that there is exclusive possession under leases and that therefore native title is extinguished, to confirm that freehold gives an exclusive possession that also has the same effect of extinguishing native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all we are asking of the Senate. But, incredibly, we are being condemned by the Labor Party for simply doing that. We have a responsibility as a government to provide certainty, as I have said, to all Australians&mdash;and that is what we are seeking to do. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very interesting contribution has just been made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). He said, `These people are entitled to certainty,' and I interjected, `What people?' By definition, the people he is referring to are those non-Aboriginal people who have freehold title, who have to have certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I put to the Leader of the Government the interesting position the government takes on this issue. The government says, `We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9663"> accept, without equivocation, that the High Court has ruled 7:0 that native title is extinguished on freehold land'&mdash;and indeed they did. In the Wik case&mdash;and I will not bother going through the judgments&mdash;every single judge on the High Court said, unequivocally, that freehold title extinguishes native title. Therefore, no-one's backyard in this country is under any threat or risk whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin said today that he did not want to talk about the letter from the senior adviser, to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer), to constituents in Melbourne, directly raising with them that their backyards might be under threat. But I put this to the government: if the government believe that freehold title does extinguish native title and they simply want to then put it in the act to give people certainty, and if&mdash;as they say they also believe&mdash;their act does not infringe the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;and they say consistently that it does not&mdash;why then don't they agree to insert a provision in their act that ensures it does not, just to give certainty to the people who have those concerns? Of course, they will not agree to anything of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to make reference to the attempted defence made by the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) of his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> interview today. I note that he is not here. He is probably off having a lie down, a Bex and a cup of tea; he certainly needed them after his screaming, ranting, raving performance in here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the transcript of the actual interview. It was not accidental of the Special Minister of State either; it was deliberate. The Special Minister of State deliberately attempted to confuse the two issues of ordinary freehold title that everyone understands being under no threat from native title, and the rather more arcane issue in law of freehold title lapsing at some time in the future and then, theoretically, leaving open the possibility of native title reviving. That occurs, of course, in cases that are known as ghost leases where, in fact, governments effectively have the freehold title and simply retain it for convenience and then, at some other stage in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government's operations, convert it for some other use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that particularly arcane legal situation does not involve the title that ordinary citizens of Australia have to their houses. As slippery as he might like to try to be, the Special Minister of State cannot avoid the fact that the entire interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> was in the context of the letter that had been sent out by the chief adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia this year to citizens in Melbourne, saying to them, `The Wik decision has raised the possibility that your backyard could be under threat.' Any reference to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> transcript will show that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that interview, the Special Minister of State said categorically, `We want people to support our bill to guarantee that freehold title does extinguish native title.' That was said in the context of a question that related to the fear that people's backyards would be under threat. So I am afraid that the defence by the Special Minister of State does not stand up. He should apologise to the people of Australia for the deliberate misrepresentation of the Wik decision; and he should reaffirm, in lights, that no-one's backyard in this country is under the slightest threat from native title&mdash;and never has been.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak in this debate to take note of the answer given today in question time. There is a particular point I want to make about the importance of confirming certainty with title where exclusive possession has been granted. It covers many, many forms of title. But in my contribution, I particularly want to deal with freehold, conditional purchase and perpetual lease titles, particularly as they affect the southern portions of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something like eight per cent of the total of the state of Western Australia comes under these particular titles, as well as one or two others, and it is in WA's agricultural areas. Let me make it quite clear that, at present in Western Australia, there are hundreds of land&hyphen;holders with freehold and exclusive leasehold titles who have been granted exclusive possession who are being forced to defend their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9664"> titles in the Federal Court. I repeat: they are being forced to defend their titles in the Federal Court. That is happening right now in the state of Western Australia. They are also incurring significant costs in being away from their farms and businesses to attend mediation conferences. Unlike claimants, they do not receive any legal aid or financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is certainty that the grant of exclusive possession does extinguish native title, why are these activities going on now? They are going on simply and purely for two reasons: firstly, to endeavour to extract&mdash;in my view, fraudulently&mdash;money to make the claimants go away; and, secondly, to try to break down the process and prove that native title still exists on freehold land. That is why it is going on right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in this place, by refusing to put down that certainty, to confirm it in the legislation, are going to create the situation of thousands and thousands, millions of dollars, still being wasted in this process&mdash;being wasted many, many times.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot let go past the comments that Senator Murray made today in his contribution. Let me give a few figures on the current mining situation in Western Australia. There is a backlog of over 7,000 mining titles with 1,900 titles caught in the right to negotiate process. Since March 1995 only 158 leases have been granted as a result of the right to negotiate, but every week a further 14 leases enter into this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does that not make it totally and absolutely clear that there needs to be certainty for mining. If ever there was a case of going backwards at a rapid rate, this is it. That is why so many of our companies are being forced to go offshore to keep their operations going.

As I have stated previously, the government, in particular Senator Minchin, have displayed a level of unprecedented arrogance and paternalism in the debate about the Wik decision and the government's response to it. It is a fundamentally important issue which renders that arrogance even more reprehensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise this is a sore spot for the coalition at the moment because the public are beginning to find out. We heard today that Senator Minchin believes he knows better than the High Court. He knows better than seven High Court judges in Mabo and seven High Court judges in Wik. Those judges clearly stated that freehold land extinguished native title. That was not good enough for Senator Minchin and obviously was not good enough for Senator Crane. Instead, they think there is more political mileage to be made out of whipping up fear and mistrust in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole debate has been categorised by an ability on the part of this government to recognise the distinct and unique relationship that Aboriginal people have with the land. It has been painted as akin to some sort of foreign invasion to be repelled with all the powers of the state. It has been characterised by a government that views native title purely as an inconvenient property right, to be read down in line with the narrowest possible interpretation of the common law. There is one word for a policy approach that seeks to absorb Aboriginal cultural imperatives: assimilation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assimilation is really a euphemism for cultural genocide. It is a policy approach which harks back to the dark, shameful days in Australia's history where the answer to the so-called Aboriginal problem was to blend indigenous people and culture into European based society. When this government diminishes and extinguishes the special property rights of Aboriginal people, it diminishes and extinguishes Aboriginal culture and, in my opinion, it diminishes itself as a country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government said that they have to read down native title rights to extinguish 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any possibility of native title surviving in any way except in the narrowest possible form because they did not want Aboriginal people to have any greater or even different property rights than the people who have stolen their country, they dangerously echo the sentiments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is fear within the community in 1997 for many reasons. People are fearful of their economic future and of all the changes that are occurring in the workplace. For instance, there have been many changes in the Public Service and to the means by which people survive. Instead of having a debate about those fears and the role that the government has played, the government is linking those fears with the prejudices that exist within society. That is worse than racism. It is worse than racism because, when you prey on fears and prejudices in order to achieve your own political ends, it is simply not acceptable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So is it unreasonable for Senator Minchin to say that freehold land can be subject to native title claim?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy says, `So what?' Those people have to defend those claims. They have to go to the legal expense of defending those claims. I was of the belief that they did not have to. I shared Senator Margetts's viewpoint. I did not think they had to either, so I wrote to the Native Title Tribunal. I rang them up as well and said, `Look, there are claims over freehold property outside Roma. It is my understanding that these claims should not be made. You, the Native Title Tribunal, have accepted these claims for determination. I want you to strike them out.' I got a letter back from the Native Title Tribunal saying, `Look, we do not believe that native title survives the grant of freehold,' but they did not strike out the claim. Those people still have claims against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators should remember one other fact. There has been on the mainland of Australia only one successful determination of the native title and that was at Crescent Head. What happened at Crescent Head was that it was a claim against land which was the subject of freehold title, because the claimant said that the crown did not have the right to issue the freehold title. There have been claims against freehold land and Crescent Head was one of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that there are other pieces of freehold land that are subject to native title claim, not just in Queensland, but also in Western Australia. I know that there are claims in relation to Western Australia. Mr Tuckey in the other place has spoken about them at length, as have Senator Lightfoot and Senator Eggleston. These claims are on foot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If honourable senators on the other side genuinely believe that freehold title extinguishes native title, then they will not have any problem voting for the bill that the government has put forward. They will not have any problem voting for the provision that says, `Right. Let's end the division here and now. Let us end this division now and pass a provision in this bill that says that freehold title extinguishes native title.' If that is what you believe, then vote with your belief, vote with your conscience and vote for that provision of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you do not vote for that provision of the bill, it is perfectly reasonable and just for those of us who sit here to ask why. Why is it that honourable senators will tell the community that freehold title has extinguished native title but will not vote for it? Why is it that they will not vote according to what they believe? Either their beliefs are weak or maybe there is another agenda. Maybe in fact they support an agenda that says that native title in certain circumstances could coexist with a freehold title. That is the only possible reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If honourable senators on the other side want to end the division, the fear and the suspicion, then they will vote for this provision of the bill because it does no harm. If they honestly believe that, then this provision of the bill takes nothing away from anybody. But, if they believe there is another motive, if they believe there is another agenda and if they have another agenda themselves, then they will vote against this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to honourable senators, you will be judged on the way you vote. The people of Australia will judge you and, if you say one thing and vote another way, you will be judged and you will be found out. The Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party will be

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 8 October 1997 about instrument No. 4 of 1997 made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 </EMPHASIS> (the SRC Act), "Directions relating to the waiver of debts due to Comcare", made under s114D(3)(b) of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By that instrument I revoked the direction that was given under s114D(3)(a) of the SRC Act in 1993. There is now no direction in force under s114D. You suggest that it may be a breach of parliamentary propriety if section 114D were "disregarded", and you therefore invite my advice that the revoked direction will be replaced by a fresh valid direction as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) has advised that revoking a direction, and not then replacing it with a new direction, does not amount to "disregarding" section 114D. This is because the SRC Act does not require that a direction under section 114D be given, nor that a revoked declaration be replaced by a new direction. The AGS further advises that section-114D gives the Minister a discretion to choose to give a direction, but shows no Parliamentary intention or expectation that the Minister should decide to exercise this power. Accordingly, the AGS can see no basis on which revoking a direction under section 114D, and not then replacing it with a new direction, could be considered a breach of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding to revoke the earlier direction, I took into account legal advice that it would be prudent to take this course because the validity of that earlier direction was questionable. This legal advice about the earlier direction was not based on any defect in the drafting of that instrument that could be remedied in any replacement instrument. Instead, the legal difficulty is caused by the interpretation of the statutory power that was relied on in giving 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that direction. Any replacement direction that tried to impose on Comcare the policy reflected in the earlier direction would face the same legal difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter explains that the Committee was concerned at the advice in the Explanatory Statement that the discretion to waive debts will continue to be administered by the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with existing policy and practice. This was not intended to imply that the existing policy would continue to be legally binding on Comcare; this advice in the Explanatory Statement was simply to inform the Committee of Comcare's intended practice in exercising (free of Ministerial direction) its statutory discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the Senate has been given notice (on behalf of the Committee) of intention to move disallowance of the instrument that revokes the earlier direction. Disallowance of that instrument would revive the revoked direction. I suggest to you that this would have the undesirable consequence of creating uncertainty about the legal basis of decisions that Comcare makes under section 114D. As noted above, the legal advice I received was that it would be prudent to revoke the earlier direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to revoke the earlier direction, and not accompany that revocation with a new direction, reflects the Government's decision to choose (for the time being) not to exercise its statutory power to direct Comcare about waiving debts. If further experience were to suggest that a new direction would be appropriate, the Government might decide to either give a direction consistent with the current statutory power or to ask the Parliament to broaden that statutory power. But I trust the Committee will accept that neither possibility provides any reason to revive the earlier, legally doubtful, direction.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Legal Adviser</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, let me say that the Committee and the Senate were saddened by the death on 10 October 1997 of the Committee's Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan AM. Professor Whalan had resigned from the position of Legal Adviser from 31 August 1997 due to ill health, following which the President gave a farewell dinner for Douglas and his wife Elizabeth, to commemorate his 15 years of service as Legal Adviser. Professor Whalan was the subject of a condolence motion in the Senate on 22 October 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After Professor Whalan's resignation the Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Miss Anne Lynch, acted as Legal Adviser until a replacement could be found. The Committee was most appreciative of the Deputy Clerk's comprehensive and detailed reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Jim Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University was appointed as Legal Adviser to the Committee from 1 October 1997. Professor Davis is well known to the Senate, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having been Legal Adviser to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills since September 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under the authority of scores of parent Acts administered through every Department of State. Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in parent Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law&hyphen;maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, by the end of the sittings Ministers have given the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or parent Acts to meet its concerns, reflecting a continuing high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non&hyphen;partisan operations. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 860 instruments, which is an historically high number. Of these, 196 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 664 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 860 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 169 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those 860 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a) : Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee to include not only technical invalidity but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical validity is, however, an important aspect of the work of the Committee. For instance, legislative instruments generally may incorporate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9677"> provisions of an Act or other legislative instrument in force from time to time, but may only incorporate other material in force at a particular date. A number of instruments purported to incorporate material from time to time as in force and the Committee raised concerns about aspects of these. One instrument incorporated a statutory instrument which was not disallowable. Other instruments incorporated material which was prepared by international bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A provision of a legislative instrument which purports to subdelegate legislative power is void unless expressly authorised by the enabling Act. One instrument provided for directions which appeared to be legislative, another purported to confer legislative power on an agency and two others provided for effect until a specified date or until an earlier date determined in one case by the Minister and in another by an agency. Another could be terminated by Gazette notice. One determination purported to confer upon the Minister power to make rules which may have been legislative for travelling allowance for parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments which provide for prejudicial retrospectivity are generally void. In one case the Committee suggested that the Act be amended to correct what appeared to be continuing problems of prejudicial retrospectivity affecting health funds and people who have medical "gap" insurance. Another important determination which was made on 1 July 1997 to come into effect on the same day was void because it was not gazetted until six weeks later. This also raised interesting questions of revocation and revival of earlier instruments. Another instrument reduced some fees retrospectively, which was valid, but also imposed new fees, which was void. The Explanatory Statement sought to justify this by advising that the industry did not object to the new fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments must comply with requirements of the enabling Act and the general law. One instrument appeared to be invalid because it had no making words, while others were not tabled within the required period and subsequently ceased to have effect. Another purported to provide that the instrument could be amended otherwise then by an amending instrument. The making words for important guidelines relating to Commonwealth procurement advised  that they were in respect of an earlier set of guidelines. One instrument appeared to be of no effect because it included wholly uncertain conditions. Other conditions were beyond power. One instrument could legally be made only after an investigation and report, which did not appear to have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that legislative instruments do not breach parliamentary propriety. One Remuneration Tribunal Determination removed significant powers relating to travelling allowances from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the President and the Speaker and gave them to the Minister, without any suitable explanation for this in the Explanatory Statement. One month later another Determination gave the same powers back to the presiding officers, again with no explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for one instrument which revoked an earlier instrument advised that the matters for which the earlier instrument provided would be dealt with administratively, even though the Act provided for the matters to be addressed by legislative instrument. This appeared to breach parliamentary propriety. One instrument did not provide for appropriate gazettal of a document. The Federal Court Rules relating to native title lapsed with a gap of four months before new ones were made. One principal instrument was amended two days after it was first made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delay in making an instrument when one should be made may breach parliamentary propriety. A Commonwealth and States agreement provided for regulations to be made as a matter of priority, but the regulations were not made for five years. One instrument amended an allowance 10 years after the last review. Another amended leave provisions after three years. A group of instruments repealed other instruments up to five years after it was appropriate to do so. Two companies were granted tax advantages with retrospectively of 25 and 16 months. One instrument provided for prejudicial retrospectivity, authorised by the enabling Act, of three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting and presentation of legislative instruments should be equal in quality to that of Acts. The Committee as usual noted numbers of drafting defects, including the wrong enabling provisions, no numbering or citation, misleading and incomplete notes, the wrong making words, wrong cross&hyphen;references, an uncertain commencement date, inconsistencies in style even in similar instruments, imprecise drafting for an offence provision, opaque and otiose provisions, no pagination of a 28 page instrument and a disallowable instrument repealing a non&hyphen;disallowable instrument. Other problems included omission of provision for notices and directions to be in writing, for officials to consider any relevant matters and not any matter and for criteria and standards to be objective rather than subjective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every legislative instrument should be accompanied by an appropriate Explanatory Statement or other explanatory material. As usual, the Committee noted the absence of this material, the wrong material, material which conflicted with the instrument and material which did not explain important provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b): Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle broadly, to include every aspect of personal rights. During the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9678"> sittings the Committee noted the following possible defects in the legislative instruments which it scrutinised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions offence provisions which may be unreasonable. Three instruments provided for strict liability offences, including one which provided for 68 such offences. Another provided for the vicarious liability of the owner, agent and master of a vessel. Another provided that prosecution action may be initiated before a mandatory notice to explain has been given or before an explanation has been received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments should provide for suitable safeguards for official actions which may affect members of the public. One instrument provided for notice to be given to produce a maintenance manual, with a penalty of $5,000 for failure to comply, but did not provide for the notice to be in writing. One provision of an instrument provided that an official "must" give notice before taking adverse action while another provision only provided that notice "may" be given. Another instrument did not provide for an official to provide a statement of reasons for adverse action. Another instrument merely provided for notice of action to be given in a newspaper, which meant that notice could be given in any newspaper at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions unusual or unexplained changes in fees and charges. One instrument abolished the right to a refund of a fee in certain  cases. Another instrument provided that successful applicants who paid large fees received a refund while those who paid a small fee did not. Another instrument provided for one fee to be increased by 150% while nine others were reduced by 10%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee protects personal privacy. One instrument required applicants to give their date of birth and residential address although these details may not have been necessary for the purposes of the instrument. Another instrument did not appear to provide for full confidentiality of details of a ballot. Another instrument, dealing with renewal of a licence, provided for date of birth to be given even though the agency already had this information which, by its nature, could not change. Another instrument provided for the use of individual details in a child immunisation program. One instrument advised that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted before the instrument was made, but the Committee still asked about privacy aspects of information received by case managers about job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments which affect a person's livelihood or ability to carry on a business should be fair. One instrument provided that all commercial leases under its provision must be to an individual, which seemed most odd. Another provided for business operators to pay on a possibly unfair basis for officials to visit their prem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ises. Another instrument may have arbitrarily excluded some businesses from beneficial provisions. Another required business operator to forward the original of an insurance policy to the Minister although it appeared that a copy would be sufficient. Another instrument was deficient in respect of notification of successful completion of an occupational training course. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument affecting business advised that it was only temporary, but did not advise how long the temporary period was, or how the instrument would be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments should not be harsh or unfair. One instrument appeared to restrict the right of patients to receive "gap" insurance payments for certain medical procedures. As noted earlier, this instrument presented problems with respect to prejudicial retrospectivity, but it also appeared to breach personal rights. The Committee suggested that the Act be amended to correct this problem as well.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many instruments of delegated legislation provide for Ministers, statutory office holders and other public officials to exercise discretions. The Committee believes that such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide their exercise, and include review of the merits of decisions by an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted the following general deficiencies with respect to discretions and review. A number of instruments provided for discretions where it may have been more appropriate to provide for officials to take mandatory action or not to give officials any power at all. Another instrument tightened the criteria for decision makers but did not provide for external merits review. A number of instruments were inconsistent in providing for AAT review. Two instruments provided for identical discretions but only one provided for review. Another instrument provided for similar discretions but only one was reviewable. One instrument did not provide for review although the enabling Act provided for AAT review of similar decisions. One instrument provided for officials of the AAT to exercise a discretion with respect to fees but did not provide for review. The Committee

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinises closely instruments which provide for unreviewable discretions which could adversely affect business. One such instrument provided for a discretion which could affect foreign ownership of airport operators. A related instrument granted a discretion to State liquor licensing authorities. One instrument provided that the approval of the Minister was necessary for a commercial activity. Another required the Minister's consent for indemnity insurance necessary to carry on business. One instrument provided for a discretion to impose a late fee on commercial applications. Another provided for discretions to extend the time for payment of an unpaid fee or a late penalty fee or to allow fees and penalties to be paid by instalment. One instrument provided for AAT review of a decision to close a business, but also effectively required the business to stop trading until the review was decided.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ladies and Gentlemen</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The title of this conference is Administrative Law and Ethics. Dicey defined administrative law as the law relating to the organisation, powers and duties of administrative authorities. It has been defined further as the body of rules which govern the exercise of executive functions by the officers or public authorities to whom they are entrusted. The courts have always had a role in these rules governing the exercise of executive functions by their issue of prerogative writs, which restrained public officials from exceeding the proper limits of their authority or which compelled them to act properly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, however, at the Commonwealth level, administrative law has come to mean the group of reforms, all made by Act of Parliament, which in the mid nineteen seventies and early nineteen eighties effected what has been described as a revolution in Commonwealth law establishing the relationship between officials and those citizens affected by their actions. These well known reforms include the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Ombudsman, the Administrative Review Council, the Freedom of Information Act and the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act. There have been further developments of these reforms, such as specialist merits review tribunals for such groups 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9680"> as, for instance, refugees, and, in an area with which I am familiar, the Legislative Instruments Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is conventional wisdom that these reforms were the first important changes in administrative law at the Commonwealth level and that what might be called the modern era of Commonwealth administrative law dates from their introduction. I would, however, like to challenge this conventional wisdom. If administrative law is the systematic and effective scrutiny and supervision of the actions of the executive with appropriate remedies for improper executive actions, then modern Commonwealth administrative law dates from the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in 1932. The Committee scrutinises all disallowable instruments for breaches of parliamentary propriety or personal rights and obtains undertakings from Ministers to amend the offending instrument or a satisfactory explanation of the apparent deficiency. The Senate has never failed to accept a recommendation from the Committee that it disallow an instrument, although we don't do this too often. In fact, the last time the Committee resolved formally to recommend disallowance if the Minister did not undertake to amend was almost two years ago. This role of the Committee as both a premier and continuing central body in administrative law should be more widely known and acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the Committee does not have a comprehensive jurisdiction over all executive activities, but none of the other bodies more often associated with Commonwealth administrative law has this comprehensive authority either. Moreover, none of them has a direct legislative control over the actions of the executive government. For instance, the AAT has strong powers but a limited jurisdiction, the Ombudsman has wide coverage but limited powers, the Federal Court under the ADJR Act has wider coverage than the AAT but no power of merits review, while there are many exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee scrutinises disallowable instruments, which form the basis of the detailed administration of almost all Commonwealth programs, with the power to recommend disallowance of any instrument or provision of an instrument. In its coverage and powers the Committee is in the mainstream of Commonwealth administrative law, and was in this position for up to half a century before other reforms which are more usually associated with such law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has come to expect this rigorous application by the Committee of its principles, with a wide range of Senators both in and out of government supporting the rights and liberties of citizens against arbitrary decision making by the executive. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is no coincidence that successive Attorneys&hyphen;General at the zenith of the development of administrative law were both Senators and had both been active and long&hyphen;standing members of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has, however, integrated the newer administrative law bodies into its operations. For instance, it insists that appropriate discretions should be reviewable by the AAT and that decision makers consult the Privacy Commissioner in suitable cases. This combination of the Committee and those other bodies provides additional safeguards in individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of administrative law by the Committee has also enhanced ethical behaviour by public officials. The Oxford dictionary defines ethics as the science of morals in human conduct. It defines moral as that which in concerned with goodness or badness of human behaviour, or with the distinction between right and wrong. In the context of this discussion, therefore, ethics really relates to public officials having a conscientious commitment to ensuring that laws and their administration are guided by morality and not merely by an apparent adherence to form or process. In short, the spirit of the law should be based on what is fair and right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best way to illustrate the impact of the Committee on administrative law and ethics is to outline a number of actual cases where the Committee raised issues which may have ethical implications. The Committee has reported to the Senate on each of these cases and if conference delegates would like further details of any of them they should contact the Committee staff in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although I have spoken so far about scrutiny of the activities of the executive the operations of the Committee include scrutiny of the Rules of Court made by the judges of each of the federal courts. These Rules are legislative in nature and disallowable by either House and the Committee subjects the rules to the same scrutiny as other delegated legislation. The Committee, through its scrutiny, has improved the quality of the Rules of the different courts. For instance, in one case, the Committee found that the judges of the High Court had made Rules which operated with prejudicial retrospectivity. The Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, then advised the Committee that the Rules would be amended. In another case the High Court advised the Committee that provisions for reversal of the usual onus of proof, about which the Committee had concerns, would be removed. In respect of another instrument the Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason, advised the Committee that its concerns about clarity of legislation would be met. The Committee has also written a number of times to the present Chief Justice of the High Court about deficiencies in the Rules.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industrial Relations Court Rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, however, the Industrial Relations Court Rules which I will use to illustrate some issues of ethics and the impact of the Committee. Those Rules, all 278 pages, were made by nine judges of that Court, including the Chief Justice. The Rules included numerous drafting errors, chiefly wrong cross&hyphen;references, although there was one provision which subsequently everyone seemed to agree was void because it was not authorised by the enabling Act. The principal concern of the Committee, however, was that the Rules were made and expressed to come into operation on 30 March 1994, but were not gazetted until more than five weeks later. Under the relevant provision of the Acts Interpretation Act, the Rules were therefore void if they affected anyone adversely, apart from the Commonwealth or its authorities. After some correspondence and some hesitation the Acting Chief Justice then advised the Committee that the entire Rules would be repealed and remade, so that the Rules would operate with unambiguous validity. The Acting Chief Justice also advised that officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department had offered to assist the Court to do this. In due course this was done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the implications for administrative law and ethics of this episode?  The first point is that, in the view of the Committee, the administration of justice by the courts should be conducted in accordance with the highest ethical standards. In cases such as this the ethics of all concerned should be beyond reproach and the action of the Chief Justice and the other judges in repealing and remaking the Rules was of a high ethical standard, even if this was done after considerable arm twisting by the Committee. The problem remains, however, that the new valid Rules were not made until six months after the old defective Rules purported to come into effect and four months after the Committee drew attention to the problem. The Committee understands that during this time actions in the Court proceeded at full steam, during the first two months because the Court was unaware that there was problem and during the next four despite knowledge that there was a difficulty. In this time it appears that numerous individuals had action taken against them under the invalid Rules, presumably with threats of violence to their person and property for any recalcitrant behaviour. For instance, the Rules provided for arrest and committal. I think that the actions of the judges in respect of this period could be seen as not of the highest ethical standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What, then, should the judges have done in this case?  The ethical response would have been to inform all persons adversely affected that the Rules may be void and that in the interests of justice the Court would order that all action taken under the Rules was consequently ineffective. This would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certainly be the ethical position in respect of action taken under the Rules in the first five weeks during which they were not even gazetted. It is not acceptable for people to be subjected to prejudicial action under delegated legislation before there has been official notification that it has been made. The ethical position would also have been that those affected should have been paid compensation by the Commonwealth for any losses which they suffered. The impact of the Committee here was that it at least ensured that the Court accepted an ethical outcome, even if there was a gap of six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Crimes Regulations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were similar ethical questions in relation to the next case which I will describe. The instrument in question was an amendment of the Crimes Regulations which was quite short and had only one purpose, to exempt the Australian Securities Commission from provisions of the Spent Convictions Scheme. That Scheme provides for important personal rights whereby, if a person was convicted of an offence more that 10 years ago and meets certain other criteria, then the conviction is spent and the person is legally able to claim, on oath or otherwise, that they were never convicted of the offence. Also, other people who are aware of the offence must generally not disclose the conviction without the consent of the person affected and must not take the conviction into account in any decision making process. The Act provides, however, for the Regulations to prescribe exemptions from the Scheme and the Regulations in question exempted the ASC in regard to all offences for the purposes of considering whether to prosecute, making submissions as to sentence, and assessing the suitability of a person to be employed by the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that the enabling Act for the Regulations provided for the Privacy Commissioner to receive applications for exemptions from the Scheme and to advise the Minister on whether an exemption should be granted. The Committee further noted that neither the making words of the Regulations nor the Explanatory Statement even referred to this requirement, much less that it had been observed, or to the substance of the Privacy Commissioner's advice, the obtaining of which was mandatory. The Committee assumed that this was because the matter was routine in nature, with no unusual or unexpected features. Nevertheless the Committee wrote to the Minister, in this case the Attorney&hyphen;General, asking for confirmation that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted and, if so, of the result of those consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reply from the Attorney&hyphen;General, dated three and a half months later, was quite a surprise. It advised that the Privacy Commissioner was indeed consulted, as required by the Act, but that the Attorney had declined to follow the Commis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9682"> sioner's advice that the exemption should not be granted. This reply was of considerable concern to the Committee. It meant that the sole provision of the Regulations was contrary to an express recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner in respect of a statutory duty to provide such advice. This concern was compounded by the fact that, as a result of the delay in replying and of the making words and the Explanatory Statement omitting any reference to the Privacy Commissioner, the Committee assumed that there was nothing untoward about the Regulations and did not give a protective notice of disallowance. Also, importantly, the incomplete Explanatory Statement also meant that individual Senators with an interest in legislation affecting personal rights were not alerted to a matter of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this point I emphasise that the Committee did not draw any conclusions about the desirability or otherwise of the substance of excluding the ASC from the Scheme, which is a matter upon which well&hyphen;informed and well&hyphen;intentioned people may differ. The Committee was concerned, however, that the important issues which the Regulations raised were concealed, whether inadvertently or not, from the attention and scrutiny of the Senate. In this context I add that the Committee strictly avoids policy issues, but does attempt to ensure openness and accountability so that Senators may take informed action in respect of individual instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After receiving this surprising advice the Committee wrote again to the Attorney&hyphen;General, suggesting that the Regulations should be repealed and remade, with a complete Explanatory Statement. This would preserve the options of the Committee and the Senate but would not disrupt the existing arrangements pending informed parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee also wrote to the Privacy Commissioner, who advised that he appreciated the continued support of the Committee in seeking to promote a more open approach by agencies in relation to differences of view with his office, particularly where legislation was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney replied that he was not able to agree to repeal and remake the Regulations, or that the making words or Explanatory Statement for other instruments should include references to any statutory mandatory consultation before making and the result of that consultation. He was, however, prepared to adopt a practice under which the views of the Privacy Commissioner would be communicated to the Committee at the same time as any future Regulations were tabled. Unfortunately this suggestion was not satisfactory because the Explanatory Statement is produced for the benefit of all Senators, not just the Committee. Many notices of disallowance by individual Senators are given on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy grounds unrelated to the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote again to the Attorney, advising that present Commonwealth drafting practice for legislative instruments appears to be to include sometimes lengthy recitals in the making words that statutory consultation requirements have been met. The Committee gave instances of such recitals. One particular instrument, drafted by officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, actually recited that it was made after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The Committee advised the Attorney that it supported this practice and assumed that if the relevant consultations or advice led to results which were unusual or unexpected, such as a decision to reject the advice of the Privacy Commissioner, that this would be explained in the Explanatory Statement. The Committee suggested that the failure to do so in the present case was a breach of parliamentary propriety. The Committee also advised the Attorney that it would write to the Minister responsible for the Federal Executive Council Handbook, asking for the Handbook to be amended to reflect the views of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to report that the final result in this case was most satisfactory. In a further reply the Attorney advised the Committee that he now agreed that the relevant information should be included in the Explanatory Statement and that he would instruct the Department to adopt that practice in future. The Secretary of the Federal Executive Council also advised that a circular which would have the effect of a revision of the Handbook would be sent to all agencies, advising of the Committee's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case also I think that there were questions about the ethical standards of the officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department who had carriage of this matter. Public administration should be both transparent and accountable and, in my opinion, the officers involved failed to meet these standards. As with many of the matters which the Committee raises, there were two levels of ethical deficiency here. The first was the initial problem perpetrated by the Department and the second was the continuing refusal to address the difficulty even after the Committee had drawn their attention to it. The ethical response to the Committee in this case would, as noted earlier, have been to repeal and remake the Regulations in question. It is a matter for regret that this was not done. The Department, of course, finally accepted the views of the Committee and this is to their credit. The Federal Executive Council secretariat, in contrast to the tardiness of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, are to be commended for promptly recognising the problem and initiating action to remedy it. Their actions reflect a high ethical standard.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next case study raises different ethical questions. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act 1993 </EMPHASIS> was assented to on Christmas Eve 1993 and on that same day the Minister for State made an important legislative Determination under the provisions of that Act. Unfortunately the Determination was never tabled in Parliament and consequently ceased to have effect 15 sitting days after it was made. The Committee picked this up more than two years later when the Minister for State made an amending Determination. The Committee noticed that there was no record of the original Determination and at once alerted the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who up until then were unaware of the failure to table. Shortly afterwards, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister in answer to a question advised that the effect of the failure could well cast a legal doubt over a large number of actions affecting the Aboriginal community, the pastoral industry and the mining industry. The Prime Minister further advised that a fresh Determination would be tabled later in the week. The States and other affected bodies would be consulted on remedial matters needed, as the Prime Minister expressed it, to patch up the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an aside, the amending Determination which caused the Committee to raise the issue was validly tabled. Its practical effect, however, was little or none, because its only substantive provisions purported to amend the earlier invalid Determination. It is ironic, and this is an ethical context, that the Explanatory Statement for the ineffective second Determination advised that its purpose was to address what it termed "problems", "uncertainty", "difficulties" and an "unintentional result" in the invalid original Determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister a fresh Determination was then made, gazetted and tabled all on the same day, which showed an alacrity not usually noticeable in the actions of the executive relating to delegated legislation. That fresh Determination, however, could operate legally only from that date and could not validate any action taken in putative reliance on the two earlier Determinations. Any such action taken during that two year period was, of course, totally void. The Committee therefore wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs about the practical effects of the invalidity and of the steps proposed to remedy the situation. The Committee noted in its letter to the Minister that the invalid Determination provided for mandatory action in specified circumstances by the Commonwealth Minister, the Commonwealth itself, the States and Territories and the Native Title Registrar. One of these circumstances, for instance, was notification by governments of their intention to do a future act, such as grant a mining lease. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> response to the Committee's inquiry the Minister advised that there may have been thousands of these actions, each of which was invalid. Another circumstance concerned applications for determinations of native title, in respect of which the Minister advised the Committee that there were hundreds of invalid actions. Another aspect of invalidity related to actions by State and Territory agencies, the Minister advising that there was little likelihood that the range and extent of these could easily, if ever, be ascertained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister further advised the Committee that, following consultations with the State and Territory governments, proposed amendments of the Native Title Act would include a provision to validate retrospectivity  all of these thousands of actions. The Committee in this case did not oppose such an amendment, if only because to do otherwise would result in the considerable financial expenditure of the last two years being wasted and because of the waste of time if the whole process had to start again. The Committee nevertheless normally has substantial reservations about Commonwealth legislation providing for prejudicial retrospectivity. The final outcome here is scarcely a flattering picture of Commonwealth public administration, with thousands of legally void actions being validated years later by prejudicially retrospectivity provisions of a Commonwealth Act. This is an unfortunate result but one which, as I say, could not be avoided without much time and money being wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ethical question here is to balance what might be termed the ethical high ground against the pragmatic approach. I think that the Committee got the balance right by drawing attention to the legal and administrative inadequacies and deploring them, but not opposing what seems to be the only practical solution to the problem. I note, however, that the Committee drew attention to the difficulty 17 months ago and that the amendments of the enabling Act to correct the original instrument which ceased to have effect more than three and a half years ago have, at the time of the preparation of this paper in early November, still not passed the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next two cases concern parliamentary propriety. A Declaration of Aboriginal Land under the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act was made on 11 October 1995 under a provision of the enabling Act which commenced on 29 September 1995. That provision required the Minister, if he or she proposed to make a Declaration, to publish a notice of intention in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>  before the Declaration was made. Neither the Declaration nor the Explanatory Statement advised that this had

In reply the Minister advised that the notice of intention and the Declaration were made on the same day with the Declaration coming into effect on gazettal on the next day. In the Minister's words, the Committee could therefore rest assured that the requirements of the Act had been followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case the Minister may have followed the letter of the Act, but there are some fundamental ethical questions. The Act clearly did not intend for mandatory notice of intention to make a grant of land to be gazetted minutes before, or even simultaneously with, the making of the grant itself. The Act must have contemplated that there would be a reasonable period between notice of intention and the grant. It is a sophism to argue otherwise, or to argue that there are no ethical issues here. It is ironic that the Committee was concerned that the period of notice may only have been 13 days.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next case involves retrospective amendments of the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Laws) Regulations. The Explanatory Statements for these advised that the 12 months retrospectivity was to correct an earlier provision which prescribed the information to be included in an evidentiary certificate used against a person to recover unpaid sales tax, because that earlier provision was inconsistent with the enabling Act. The Committee was concerned at a number of aspects of the Regulations but in particular asked about the use of the evidentiary certificates during the period of retrospectivity. The Minister advised that six such certificates had been issued, none of which complied with the Regulations in force at the time, and that the Australian Government Solicitor, who acts for the Australian Taxation Office in these matters, had advised that the legislation was disregarded because of uncertainty about what it meant and the perceived inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This case raises a number of ethical issues. The first is that the taxation office disregarded express provisions of Regulations in relation to proceedings to recover money allegedly due. The reasons given by the Minister for these actions are that the tax officials could not understand the legislation and, in any event, thought that it was invalid. On one level this may have some ethical validity but it leads to the question of why action to correct the matter was not taken earlier.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last case which I will describe relates to the Approved Occupational Clothing Guidelines, made under everybody's favourite Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Guidelines, which affect large 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> numbers of Australian wage and salary earners and which also have an effect on the national revenue, were made under a provision of that Act which provided that expenditure incurred by an employee in relation to non&hyphen;compulsory uniform or wardrobe was not tax deductible unless the clothing was entered on a Register. The provisions also required the Minister to formulate Guidelines setting out criteria for the entry of clothes on the Register. The Guidelines in question consisted of 57 consecutively numbered clauses, some of which were in italics and some not in italics and some in both italics and non&hyphen;italics. Some of the clauses were also partly in bold and some partly underlined. A helpful note, however, advised that the material in italics was explanatory only and did not form part of the Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned, however, about possible invalid prejudicial retrospectivity. The Guidelines were made on 7 June 1995 and one of the clauses, admittedly in italics, advised that they superseded the previous Guidelines with effect from that date. If this was the case and the new Guidelines were prejudicial then they would be void under the Acts Interpretation Act because the new ones were not gazetted until two weeks later, on 21 June 1995. The position was complicated further by advice in the Explanatory Statement which appeared to be that the old Guidelines were in force up until 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote to the Minister who advised that most of the new Guidelines were more generous to taxpayers than the old ones, although there were some areas where they were more strict. The Minister further advised, however, that the officials who administered the Guidelines did not reject any applications dated between 7 and 21 June 1995 which would have satisfied the original Guidelines but not the new ones. Also, any application between those two dates which would have satisfied the new Guidelines but not the old would also be approved. The Committee noted that the result appeared to be that no person was actually disadvantaged because for two weeks in the last month of the financial year the authorities administered both the old and new Guidelines simultaneously, applying the relevant beneficial provisions of both Guidelines while ignoring the detrimental provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This case presents interesting ethical questions, but the tax office probably got it right. There were clearly problems with the validity of the new Guidelines but to reactivate the old ones would have perpetuated old detrimental provisions without providing for the new exemptions. Also, the end of the financial year had gone and people were submitting their returns. There is still the ethical problem that the authorities did not administer the law as it existed but rather applied it in a creative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9685"> way which seemed to be the fairest to them. In any event, the view of the Committee, with its tongue firmly in its cheek, is that any action by the tax office which expands available concessions, whether lawfully or not, is highly ethical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have outlined these few cases to illustrate aspects of the impact of the Committee on ethics and administrative law. In two of the cases the Committee had to struggle to impose ethical standards on the judges of the Industrial Relations Court and on officials of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. On the other hand, in the case of the invalid native title Determination the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet accepted from the outset that there was a problem which had to be addressed, while the other cases did not of their nature require remedial action although they raised ethical issues. I would, however, emphasise that these are only instances of the hundreds of pieces of correspondence which the Committee sends and receives each year. All of these address some aspect of personal rights and parliamentary propriety and as such all include an ethical component, because delegated legislation which breaches either of these standards has ethical problems. The impact of the Committee on ethics and administrative law is not a series of isolated cases but is a continuing unified process by a body central to Commonwealth administrative law and which has engaged in scrutiny of official action for decades longer than other bodies more often identified with such law. The overriding concern is to meet the intrinsic moral obligations of our terms of reference, and we look forward to continuing to do this for many years to come.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of facilities&mdash;Stage 3 at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Stirling</EMPHASIS> , WA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In brief, the proposal examined by the Committee involves the provision of expanded or new facilities to improve operational support, training, logistic support facilities and personnel support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out turn cost of the proposed development is $19 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Stirling</EMPHASIS>  provides operational, logistics, administrative, personnel and recreational support for assigned and visiting warships as well as port, berthing, ship side and administrative services. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collins</EMPHASIS>  class submarines will be home ported at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> . At present, the Base supports 2,433 naval and civilian personnel. By the year 2004 when half the Australian fleet is home ported there, this is expected to increase to approximately 3,160.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support demands are therefore expected to rise early in the next century when the number of home ported major units is planned to increase from 10 to about 14.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the benefit of Honourable Members, I should mention that these units are expected to include seven frigates comprising both FFG and ANZAC&mdash;class ships, six submarines and one fleet support vessel, together with associated ship borne helicopters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>  has spanned almost three decades and has involved a number of stages. The Parliament, through the Public Works Committee, has been involved throughout this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has calculated, from the five previous reports on the development of naval facilities on the Island, that total expenditure so far, in 1997 prices, has been $459 million. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9686">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Facilities at Stirling are a credit to the Defence force and to the designers, engineers and the construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded, based on the evidence presented and a detailed inspection of existing facilities, that there is a need to further improve operational support, training, logistics and personnel support facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling </EMPHASIS> either by the provision of extensions to existing facilities or through new construction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed work can be justified as meeting anticipated requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the Department of Defence should review two components of the proposed works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is extensions to facilities proposed for the naval diving clearance teams. The Committee has recommended that the review should include the benefits of the construction of a new facility at a more suitable location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second involves a review of the siting of the flight deck procedural trainer in relation to the overall cost, including the provision of power, without compromising safety or the realism of training scenarios.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of benefits to the local community, the Committee was advised that an average of about 70 personnel will be directly employed on construction activities during the 14 month construction period. It is likely that local subcontractors will be used on the project. It is also worth noting that the Base already contributes about $200 million to the local economy each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report highlights that the Department of Defence has established an exemplary record in the environmental management of the Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth mentioning that this outstanding record comes at considerable cost; the annual cost of environmental management of the Island is at least $430,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with past practice, extensive environmental investigations were carried out. Each component of the proposal was tested in relation to justification, siting, the exiting environment and environmental impact assessments were then made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a thorough process and a number of changes were made to what was originally proposed in response to recommendations by the Garden Island Environmental Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence has demonstrated a commitment, within operational constraints, towards the conservation and protection for public use of the environmental values of the Island.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed Australian National Maritime Museum Maritime Heritage Centre,at Wharf 7, Pyrmont, NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Museum was opened in November 1991 and the USA Gallery, the bicentennial gift from the United States of America to the people of Australia, was dedicated in January 1992 by Mr George Bush, President of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its opening, the Museum has achieved a number of significant milestones including the number of visitors attracted by the many artefacts and exhibitions on display.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the current financial year, the total number of visitors passed the two million mark, thereby establishing the Museum as one of the most popular museums in Sydney and one of the world's most visited maritime museums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Museum's outreach and travelling exhibitions attract a further 200,000 visitors per annum nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the acquisition by the Commonwealth of a 99&hyphen;year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont and for the construction of a building to provide accommodation for its back&hyphen;of&hyphen;house activities, including collection and display areas and a library.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of the development, $19.5 million in all, will be borrowed from a major bank and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that Australian National Maritime Museum, as a national institution, plays a key role in reflecting Australia's maritime heritage and culture through public displays, restoration, storage and research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leased premises, some distance from its main exhibition building in Pyrmont, house Museum support activities, including the growing store of artefacts and other material. The lease on these premises expires in mid&hyphen;1999, when the site will be available for redevelopment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to find other suitable accommodation to house the Museum's support activities, preferably adjacent to the main exhibition building.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has been offered a property adjacent to the main exhibition building, for development contingent upon the inclusion of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9687"> elements of the Sydney Maritime Museum in any new facility, and that any Museum development adhere to local planning schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the evidence provided to the Committee, the site is considered suitable for the proposed building to house the Museum's library, laboratories, workshops, collection display areas, meeting rooms, amenities and offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The design of the proposed building recognises planning parameters and, based on the evidence, will meet the Museum's functional and spatial requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes the success of the proposed development depends on providing a readily identifiable link between the main exhibitions building and the centre and the resolution of public liability issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will require the Museum to discuss further with the City West Development Corporation and the Council of the City of Sydney issues of public liability and the placement of objects, with maritime themes, in the public park which separates the two buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of the proposed work will be met from savings offset from rent being paid for leased premises and from commercial tenancies in the proposed facility.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) as a statutory authority, separate from the Attorney-General's Department, so as to enhance its position as the government's legal firm in providing quality legal services to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also provide a framework for greater contestability in the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth, in particular, to enable private law firms to compete for the first time for significant areas of Commonwealth litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's Law and Justice Policy for the last election included a commitment to undertake a review of legal services provided by the Attorney-General's Legal Practice, including an examination of the possibilities for government Departments and agencies to use private legal firms for litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To fulfil that commitment, in November 1996 the Attorney-General commissioned a review of the Commonwealth's legal services needs and how those needs could best be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review committee, which comprised an experienced businessman, a prominent barrister and the then Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, undertook an extensive review of these issues.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9688">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee consulted with Departments and agencies about their legal services needs, as well as holding discussions with the Legal Practice, departmental legal units and private-sector lawyers about the delivery of legal services to government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also commissioned a survey of the Legal Practice's clients and a detailed business analysis of the Legal Practice, and invited public submissions on the issues being examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's report (the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the Review of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice</EMPHASIS> ) was delivered in March 1997 and made 16 recommendations for reform of the Legal Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee found that the Legal Practice had made considerable improvements over recent years in its efficiency and the quality of its services (reflected in the generally positive responses to the client survey). However, significant further improvement was possible and desirable, particularly if the government solicitor were to continue to provide high-quality, cost-effective legal services in an increasingly competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the fundamental questions examined by the committee was whether the retention of a government-owned Legal Practice was justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee found that maintaining government ownership of the Legal Practice was in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for this included the ability of the Legal Practice to meet the legal services needs of the Commonwealth (which could be put at risk if the Legal Practice were sold), its abilities to meet the legal services needs of Departments and agencies because of its particular focus on government work, its ability to maintain a `whole of government' approach, its strong corporate memory, and the need for a government legal service provider to meet the unique role and needs of the Attorney-General in providing legal services which are core to government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the report recommended retention of the Legal Practice as a government authority, albeit with greater contestability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered all options, including the possible sale of the commercial parts of the Legal Practice, but has firmly concluded for the reasons outlined by the committee that they should be retained within government ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government also considers that, without further reform, the AGS will face a serious risk of not being competitive in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is principally because of the current limits on the AGS's business structure and operations, by virtue of its status as part of the Attorney-General's Department.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These limitations are not shared by the private law firms with which the AGS is increasingly being asked to compete.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore accepted the thrust of the committee's recommendations, and in particular has decided to restructure the AGS as a new legal services provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will implement this decision by amending the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the AGS as a new statutory body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGS will be structured in a way that maximises its ability to provide legal services and conduct its business operations, on a commercial, competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its separation from the Attorney-General's Department will facilitate its operation as a government business enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the usual approach for government business enterprises (and the position enjoyed by private law firms), it will also be able to employ staff and consultants outside the usual public service regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, it will be able to charge fees at market rates in relation to the legal services it provides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGS will not be established under the Corporations Law, but will be set up as a government-owned statutory authority, headed by a CEO, rather than a board of directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CEO will be responsible for the management of the AGS and will otherwise have responsibilities similar to the boards of other government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGS will be able to provide legal and related services to a range of government Departments, agencies and officers, including to State and Territory bodies if they request it to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional limits mean that, unlike private law firms, the AGS's potential client base is largely limited to the Commonwealth government and its agencies and a small range of persons who are acting for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes it clear that the AGS will be able to provide advice to the full range of clients within the constitutional limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This more focused client base will enable the AGS to deliver a unified, specialised and nationally-coordinated approach to government legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGS is not, and cannot be, the same as privately owned law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its unique value to government is based on its government ownership and its expertise in delivering legal services to government clients. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9689">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with this role, some limited core areas of government legal work, primarily Cabinet, constitutional and national security matters, will be reserved to the AGS, and not be available to private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public interest served by having the AGS undertake this role is not inconsistent with having the AGS operate at the highest level of efficiency and making a profit as a government business enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a government business enterprise, the AGS will have, in effect, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance and Administration as `joint shareholders'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with this approach, the bill gives joint responsibility to the Attorney-General and Minister for Finance and Administration for the business operations of the AGS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will not interfere with the legal professional functions of the AGS, nor the Attorney-General's responsibilities as First Law Officer in relation to these functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Competitive neutrality</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to ensuring that, as far as possible, government-owned businesses are placed in the same position as the privately-owned businesses with which they compete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most areas of work, Departments and agencies will be able to use private law firms to carry out their legal work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, litigation other than that in the reserved categories will be contestable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This opening up of most categories of litigation completes the process of providing choice to government clients that was commenced in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the proposed commencement on 1 July 1998 of the new system, approval for untying of litigation will be possible on an ad hoc administrative basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains several measures to ensure that, consistent with the Government's Competitive Neutrality Policy Statement, the AGS will not enjoy any competitive advantage over private law firms by virtue of its government ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, the bill will establish a mechanism to require the AGS to pay to the Commonwealth, in respect of each financial year, an amount equivalent to the total amount of any taxation liability that would have been incurred by it under Commonwealth, State and Territory laws if it were a firm of legal practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the AGS will not be subject to State and Territory taxation laws unless they are specially prescribed, requiring the AGS to make a tax equivalent payment will ensure that it enjoys no net 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitive taxation advantage over private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Attorney-General will be empowered, together with the Minister for Finance and Administration and after consultation with the CEO of the AGS, to determine corporate governance arrangements for the AGS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporate governance arrangements will enable the AGS to be required to make other payments where this is necessary to achieve competitive neutrality in respect of costs incurred by private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with other government business enterprises, the AGS will be required to pay to the Commonwealth a dividend, analogous to the return of profits to the partners in a law firm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the power to determine corporate governance arrangements will enable the arrangements that apply to the AGS to take into account the particular structure of the AGS and its function of providing legal services to government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the AGS will be subject to the reporting, accountability and financial requirements of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Legal Services Directions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also gives the Attorney-General power to issue Legal Services Directions, relating to Commonwealth legal work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Directions will be capable of applying to Departments and agencies in receipt of legal services and to their legal services providers, including the AGS, private legal firms and `in-house' legal units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Directions will provide a framework for the conduct of the Commonwealth's legal affairs, but will leave prime responsibility for the effective and efficient use of legal services with Departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directions will be able to be made on the full range of issues affecting Commonwealth legal work, including what work is to be contestable, reporting arrangements in relation to legal work, and compliance by legal service providers with the obligation of the Commonwealth to act as a model litigant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This power to issue Directions will ensure that the Attorney-General, will be in a position to manage risks that could arise from the provision of legal services that are inconsistent, that lack coordination, or that do not identify and appropriately deal with whole of government and public interest issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is necessary in an environment where an increased range of government legal work will be contestable by private sector firms, which are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9690"> providing a significant proportion of overall legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Attorney-General is determined to ensure that minimum restrictions are imposed on the way legal services are provided to Departments and agencies, consistent with the aim of ensuring that Departments and agencies should be fully and directly accountable for their decisions in relation to legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the recommendations of the report on the Legal Practice, the Government approved the establishment within the Attorney-General's Department of the Office of Legal Services Coordination to assist the Attorney-General in discharging his First Law Officer role, especially in relation to litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office is now operational and will assist the Attorney-General in the preparation of Legal Services Directions and in consulting with Departments and agencies, as well as the private profession, about their content.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also advise on Commonwealth litigation policy, both in general and in relation to particular cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will have an important role to play in advising Departments and agencies on their obligations under the Legal Services Directions and on the purchase and delivery of legal services, so as to achieve maximum efficiency and appropriate risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to issue Directions is designed to enable the Attorney-General of the day to fulfil his or her First Law Officer functions in relation to the provision of legal services to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compliance with Directions will therefore not be enforceable other than by the Attorney-General, and only the Commonwealth will be able to raise the issue of non-compliance with Directions in any legal proceedings.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms introduced by the bill will give the AGS the structure and flexibility in its business activities and legal services work to enable it to continue to provide high-quality legal services to government in an increasingly competitive market.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a measured, fair and practical response to the problem of unduly high prices for music sound recordings in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this way the act can be used to control the Australian market for imported copies of recordings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is significant as imported recordings constitute the overwhelming percentage of recordings marketed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will exempt the importation of non-pirate copies of a sound recording from infringement of copyright in either the sound recording or in the works recorded on the recording.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will thereby remove the ability of copyright owners to control the market for each imported copy of a sound recording.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns have long been held that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act have been used to obtain higher prices for records and CDs than those prevailing in some other countries, notably, the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns were raised in an inquiry by the Copyright Law Review Committee, on which it reported in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was followed by an inquiry into the prices of sound recordings by the then Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PSA found that prices of sound recordings were unreasonably high in Australia and recommended either partial or full removal of copyright control over importation of legitimate copies, thereby introducing direct competition as a mechanism for reducing prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike the Labor Government which lacked the resolve to implement the PSA Report, changing its mind repeatedly over 4 years, we have acted decisively on those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we have not done so precipitantly&mdash;or without regard to possible changes in the market and market behaviour since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our election commitments we stated that we would consult industry and the community on the most effective means of lowering prices for music CDs, and we have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Views were sought from a wide cross-section of the Australian music and copyright industries, including representatives of performers, record producers and music publishers, and from consumers. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9691">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our decision to follow, in essence, the recommendation of the PSA reflects this Government's conclusion that insufficient effort had been made by the recording industry to embrace competition and provide world-competitive pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the estimates of the amount of the reduction vary, all the economic advice obtained suggests that allowing importation of legitimate CDs will lead to a reduction in prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also has the potential to expand availability of overseas recordings in response to consumer demand, and will give retailers freedom of choice in sourcing supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If expected price reductions lead to increased sales, artists receiving royalty income from sales may well achieve a net gain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, we are aware of the industry arguments that allowing importation will reduce returns and allow greater potential for importation of pirate copies of sound recordings into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill responds fully to those concerns, so far as they are justified, in the following way:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill largely achieves its effect through excluding what are defined as "non-infringing copies" of sound recordings from the rights to take action for unauthorised importation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crucial provision is therefore the definition of "non-infringing copy".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a copy must have been made without infringing any law in the country where it was made protecting copyright in any musical or other work used in the sound recording.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "non-infringing copy" is explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a 10 per cent increase over existing maximum penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum term of 5 years imprisonment that may currently be imposed as an alternative, or in addition, to a fine for some copyright offences by individuals will apply across all the primary infringement offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The language and form of these penalty provisions will also be adjusted to reflect current usage for imposition of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act presently limits the discretion of the courts by restricting the maximum penalty for each infringing article, such as a book or a software disk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the value of the copyright carried on the disk or in the book may vary considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will remove maximum penalties for each infringing copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum will apply whether there is one or many infringing copies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current distinction between the maximum penalty for a first offence and that for a subsequent offence is also removed for these offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And last, the setting of maximum penalties for infringements related to films at different levels to those for infringements for other copyright subject matter is no longer justifiable or necessary, and is also done away with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes, while primarily aimed at modernising these penalty provisions, also send a clear message to the courts, as well as would-be offenders, that copyright piracy offences are serious matters.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and other aviation&hyphen;related legislation. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act mainly relate to the Commonwealth's initiative in introducing a national scheme requiring air carriers to carry mandatory non&hyphen;voidable passenger liability insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requirement means that, in the event of an air accident, passengers, or their relatives, are assured as far as possible of receiving compensation to the amount of $500,000 per passenger for their death or injury. The Commonwealth requirements are reflected in complementary state legislation, so that a mandatory passenger liability insurance scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will operate nationally to cover all commercial flights in Australia. Uniform application of state legislation will not come into effect until these Commonwealth amendments are enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal amendments proposed to the two acts are of a minor nature and are intended to make the administration of the national scheme simpler, and thereby ensure the full and effective implementation of the Commonwealth's initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act will authorise the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to directly administer both the Commonwealth Carriers' Liability Act and the complementary state legislation, rather than under delegation from the Commonwealth and state ministers responsible for transport. This will clarify the position on state/Commonwealth delegation of powers, and powers of enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, to assist CASA further with the enforcement of the national requirements, offences under the state acts must be regarded as Commonwealth offences. To this end, the Carriers' Liability Act will also be amended to enable Commonwealth authorities to investigate and prosecute offences under the State acts as if they were Commonwealth offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further minor amendment to the Carriers' Liability Act will allow Australian governments to self&hyphen;insure their risks under the act, instead of requiring them to take out commercial insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, Commonwealth and State government agencies are required to insure any passengers that they occasionally carry for reward, in accordance with the Carriers' Liability Act requirements. However, it is not the practice of Australian governments to carry commercial insurance. The bill therefore provides that, where both carrier and insurer are the Crown, the carrier need not have a stipulated contract of insurance to satisfy the technical requirements of the act, but must still satisfy CASA that the arrangements it puts in place for coverage of passengers satisfies those requirements of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act will also impose conditions upon Air Operator's Certificates (AOCs) which will require that operators continuously hold the mandatory passenger liability insurance required by the Carriers' Liability Act. Therefore, these amendments will give CASA the authority under legislation to more effectively prevent an operator carrying passengers without the mandatory insurance. CASA will be empowered to cancel, suspend or vary an AOC where an operator allows that insurance to lapse, but continues to carry passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of minor corrections to other aviation&hyphen;related legislation. The corrections, of a formal or typographical nature, in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9693"> Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Act 1995 have retrospective effect, in order to ensure that they have effect from the original date of commencement of the provisions being corrected. The retrospective repeal of certain amendments in the Civil Aviation Act 1988 is purely to remove them as they are no longer necessary. The corrections and the repeal have no effect on the rights, duties and obligations of any person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal amendments in this bill will ensure effective protection of an aviation consumer's entitlement to adequate compensation in the event of an air accident, anywhere in Australia. This will fully implement the original intention of the Commonwealth's initiative, in reforming this aspect of consumer protection in the aviation sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier, I was concluding my speech on how the uncertainty of this legislation, in its current form, is affecting regional Australia, particularly regional New South Wales where the western division leases have not been included in schedule 4 because Premier Carr was not prepared to say that they were leases that conferred exclusive tenure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many projects that are being held up&mdash;about 40 projects&mdash;and some of them are worth millions of dollars. There is one at Cobar&mdash;the emu abattoir&mdash;which will provide 100 jobs. Senator West has been around that part of the world for the Labor Party saying that she supports the abattoir. The best thing she could do to make sure that that abattoir is built is to vote for this legislation. That will provide the certainty to get these sorts of projects off the ground. It would be nice to see her vote with her feet on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important project that is being held up is the gas pipeline that is going from Moomba to Sydney. It has a spur that is going up to Forbes and Dubbo and further north up to Tamworth. This has been held up by recent native title claims demanding millions of dollars before they will withdraw their claims. That is a very large project that is very important to the people of regional New South Wales. It is being held up because of the erroneous nature of the previous and existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is simply killing regional New South Wales. The ALP, including Independent Mr Andren, who represents the seat of Calare, who voted with the Labor Party against the native title legislation in the House of Representatives, is standing between the present messy and unacceptable situation and the progress and jobs that will be provided by a more realistic and appropriate response to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9694"> the legitimate Aboriginal claims for native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While people may disagree about the details of this legislation, there is absolutely no doubt that the Native Title Act needs amending. The previous government agreed with the Attorney-General's advice in 1995 that amendments to the bill were necessary, particularly after the High Court's Brandy decision. Aboriginal representative groups agree, including ATSIC and the working party, and so does Justice Robert French of the National Native Title Tribunal. An undertaking to amend the bill was part of our policy platform leading up to the election, so there was never any doubt about where this government stood on the Native Title Act in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australians are acutely aware of the problems created by the current native title legislation. We have 27 claims with the Native Title Tribunal and more are expected. Many of them claim exclusive possession and overlap claims for exclusive possession by other Aboriginal groups&mdash;perhaps a lesson may be needed in coexistence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These claims cover almost two-thirds of the state, although, of course, native title has not been found to exist yet in South Australia. The claims have been made by 7,500 adult Aborigines who live in South Australia&mdash;one half of one per cent of the state's population. Of the landmass of our state, 18.7 per cent is already owned as Aboriginal freehold. In fact, more is owned as Aboriginal freehold than the amount of freehold owned by the rest of us, and that is before these claims are determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our largest claim, covering a variety of land tenures, covers almost 152,000 square kilometres of our state, covering much of the Flinders Ranges. It is one of two claims that have been lodged by the Kuyani people. The Barngarla claim, which covers pastoral and grain growing areas of the state, includes very large areas of freehold land, reserves, extensive pastoral and other leases, crown land and land owned by other Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freehold land in the town of Ceduna has been claimed by the Maralinga people, and they have also claimed the adjacent beaches 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the foreshore and coastline of our new Great Australian Bight Marine Park. These claims are made in quite inflammatory language which demands `the possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the land, minerals and waters to the exclusion of all others'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt: in my state significant areas of freehold land and schools, churches and community halls are included in these claims. Where is the certainty for them under the current legislation? My colleague Senator O'Chee just a few minutes ago talked about the difficulties he has had with the Queensland branch of the Native Title Tribunal in trying to have some of these freehold claims in Queensland struck out. So we can only wonder about the freehold claims in South Australia. This bill will enable states and territories to confirm that native title was extinguished over freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the unfortunate effects of these and other claims around the nation is the delays and the costly obstacles to new, not established, resource processing projects, which surely means that all of us suffer&mdash;all Australians lose. This is especially true of the projects around South Australia's resource rich Gawler Craton, with its exciting new prospective areas of gold, copper, nickel, diamonds, iron ore bodies and, of course, the well&hyphen;established coal reserves in that area. This area, which extends from Yorke Peninsula across several hundred kilometres beyond Coober Pedy, and which includes the magnificent Roxby Downs copper and uranium mine, is now covered by multiple native title claims by the Kuyani, Kokatha, Yandrawandha and Dieri peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of our most richly prospective areas, where a number of small resource companies are beginning to plan their new mines and to offer the state of South Australia a substantial boost in economic performance as well as, very importantly, jobs in the remote parts of our state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prospecting rights on our opal rich northern regions are now also uncertain. There is absolutely no doubt that this uncertainty is driving our resource industries offshore. Companies simply are not investing in new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9695"> mines, preferring instead to extend their existing mines and to try to prolong the prospectiveness of those resource areas. This bill will restore certainty and optimism to the mining industry by improving the threshold test and introducing more flexibility into the right to negotiate process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal activist Father Frank Brennan has described the right to negotiate as `an appropriate means by which Aboriginal people might have some economic impoundment'. Mining companies have told the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund that they accept that native title is now a statutory infrastructure cost to be taken into account when new mines are considered and new exploration is undertaken. In fact, the increased cost of gaining access to land, using the right to negotiate process, can now represent about 20 per cent of the budget for a typical exploration project. It is therefore absolutely crucial that the right to negotiate is a clear and respected mechanism for dealing with legitimate native title claimants and not 20 separate feuding family claimants. This bill will ensure the right to negotiate is not abused. It will enable the representative bodies to also play a role in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For generations, the South Australian pastoral industry&mdash;which comprises 39 per cent of our state spread over 300 or so leases&mdash;has shared its land with our Aboriginal peoples, with rights which have enabled Aboriginals to travel across, stay on, pass through or hunt, gather or forage on the land as part of their traditional activities. This bill, unlike the Labor government's legislation, preserves those current access rights for Aborigines in South Australia and in all other states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our pastoral industry is rich in history. Over the past 150 years it has contributed enormously, providing a significant capital base for the development and economic wealth of the state. More recently, however, the industry has suffered economically from the near destruction of our wool industry and from the collapse of cattle prices. Surely these families should be able to appropriately diversify their agricultural activities to support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their families, without attracting a costly and complex legal process? After all the average farm business profit in that region over the past four years is less than $4,000 per year per family. That is hardly millionaires' row, although, sadly, it has been the target of far too many misguided and cruel accusations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may wonder why so many of our pastoral leases are under claim. Perhaps the answer lies in the answer given to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund by the South Australian Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement. In response to the question, `What other rights could native title possibly include that are not now covered by our reservation rights?', came this enlightening statement: `The right to negotiate.' Interestingly enough, that is a statutory right given to Aborigines by the Labor Party and certainly not discovered on the island of Mer by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many pastoralists have effectively shared their land with Aboriginal communities, and they have told me how betrayed they feel when indigenous leaders deny them any recognition of the spiritual attachment they feel for the land that they have occupied for generations&mdash;sometimes more than a century. How could David Ross and Noel Pearson so cruelly reject the very clear and, in many cases, deep and spiritual attachment pastoralists have to their land? Yet this is precisely what they did when they appeared before the parliamentary joint committee. It was a disgraceful renunciation of a legitimate attachment to land. This bill will enable pastoralists to manage their properties, while recognising any coexisting native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this public debate has revealed to me once again is the depth and breadth of the farm&hyphen;city gap in this country and the degree to which those families in the leafy streets of our metropolitan cities fail to appreciate or even understand the reality of life in the bush: over the Dandenongs, beyond the Blue Mountains and past the Adelaide Hills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many residents of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane know the heartache and uncertainty that comes with the arrival in the roadside mailbox of one native title claim after another? Some of these claims 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9696"> are from people living hundreds of kilometres away who have never sought to visit the farm or the region. How many of that sea of waving hands on the lawns near here were contributed by families whose homes and businesses are under claim?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a commonsense attempt to balance the interests of all Australians, wherever they live, to ensure that the resource industries of this nation continue to grow and to prosper for the benefit of all of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. I believe we have a very important opportunity in making our contribution. I certainly want to make the point, first of all, that we are making our speeches at a time that is historically important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are alive in a piece of history. To my mind it is not unlike the significance of living through the First World War, the Second World War or the fall of the Iron Curtain. What we are debating today is a piece of legislation that is of such historical importance that it equates with those events I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, said the other day, `We are not just living through history; we are making history.' He reminded us that we have a great responsibility to ensure that we `get it right'. He asked, `Will generations look back upon us and our actions as something for which they must apologise or something of which they must be proud?' I believe that is the most significant question we need to ask at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation comes as part of the reconciliation process, and there is an importance in that too. There are many things in our history, when we look back at them, of which we cannot be proud. The stolen children report made that absolutely clear. For that we need to apologise&mdash;say we are sorry&mdash;and many of us have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also look back to the historical event of the 1967 referendum, which effectively gave Aboriginal people in this country the right to be citizens in their own country. Before that, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal people were effectively not citizens in this Commonwealth. They were not recognised as such, not counted as existing and not able to vote. The referendum changed all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very interesting thing for a senator from South Australia, as I am, to reflect on the impact of that referendum, particularly because, while Aboriginal men had the right to vote, after 1894 Aboriginal women also had the right to vote in South Australia and, indeed, exercised that vote on a few occasions. In the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902, Aboriginal people were excluded, except in so far as they did have the right to vote previously under section 41, I think. But, effectively, what happened with the 1902 act was that all Aboriginal people were then either actively denied or disregarded in terms of their right to continue to vote in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1967 referendum saw that injustice taken away. I have been reading an excellent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The origins of the Commonwealth involvement in indigenous affairs in the 1967 referendum, Information Research Service Background Paper No. 11 of 1996&hyphen;97</EMPHASIS>, produced by our Parliamentary Library, and the history makes an excellent piece of reading. It is interesting to read just who had what to say about the rights of Aboriginal people at that time. It is interesting to note that, when the bill for the referendum was introduced into the parliament, it was unanimously supported. For the record, I note in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Churches came out strongly in support of the Yes vote, the Heads of all    the major denominations publicly pledging their support. The Anglican Primate  saw it as a way of helping to build the Aborigines' self&hyphen;confidence, self&hyphen;reliance and self&hyphen;respect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder whether the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have raised objections about the churches' contribution in that debate. I will come back to that shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of Aboriginal rights, particularly their right to vote, is something&mdash;through the history of South Australia&mdash;that has great resonance for me as a woman and, indeed, for women in this country because women were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9697"> described as equally unfit to vote&mdash;the words used about Aboriginal people. You could not expect Aboriginal people to vote; they did not have the intelligence. That is what was said in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. They were exactly the sorts of comments that were said about women. They were equally wrong and equally offensive to both groups. But women in Australia, except Aboriginal women along with Aboriginal men, did not have to wait until a referendum in 1967 to have the right to have a say in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to the significance of the Mabo decision and the history of the Native Title Act. I would like to quote from the contribution of my colleague Senator Bolkus to this debate on Tuesday, 25 November, because I think he says it very succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mabo decision corrected that great lie upon which this nation had been built. For over 200 years, through the application of the doctrine of terra nullius, Australian law had sought to hide the fact that we were not the first inhabitants of this land. Our law sought to pretend that the indigenous Australians did not have cultures that dealt with issues of land management, nor did the law seek to understand the very special spiritual and cultural attachment of indigenous Australians to this land&mdash;their land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what the Native Title Act 1993 did. It actually recognised the common law rights of Australia's indigenous people in native title. It created a mechanism for recognising and protecting native title rights and it confirmed all rights, indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous. In the act, some native title rights were extinguished to give certainty to leases granted between 1975 and 1994, but only after significant negotiation with Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The doctrine of terra nullius has its own particular irony in my state of South Australia. There was much discussion and debate and principles were established as to how the new colony would be established. While I cannot claim to be full bottle on all of these details, I do understand that Lord Glenelg and also Torrens, in discussion and formulation of the guidelines for this new colony, agreed that there would have to be compensation to the natives in the area. In fact, the British govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment withheld the letters patent allowing the colony to be established until there was an agreement that would be the case. I am advised that when the relevant people arrived in South Australia they simply refused to implement that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to understand why, shortly after the establishment of that colony in South Australia, the local community saw fit to establish pastoral leases at all. The colonial office of the British government `had three objectives&mdash;to ensure the land did not pass permanently into private hands, to allow the pastoral industry to expand, and `to protect Aborigines'. They created a `special form of land tenure&mdash;the pastoral lease&mdash;which provided for joint occupation of the same land by the resident squatter and the local land&hyphen;owning clan'. Henry Reynolds in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Law of the Land</EMPHASIS> makes a comment about this. He says, as quoted by Mark Horstman in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arena Magazine</EMPHASIS> of 22 AprilMay 1996, page 31:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were agreed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as we might in this bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases, contemporary Australia would show itself to the world as having less interest in protecting Aboriginal interests than the aristocratic Englishmen who ran the Empire 150 years ago.</PARA>

But Henry Reynolds is more than able to speak for himself and I will make sure that he sees a copy of your interjection, Senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perfectly reasonable what the British government intended by way of acknowledging the existence of Aboriginal people and their rights to land usage all those years ago. That is what the Native Title Act did and that is what we on this side are concerned to see continues and is not deleted under the  Native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9698"> Title Amendment Bill , as proposed by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further supporting comments come from people who, perhaps, might be regarded as an unlikely source. John Sheehan, the spokesperson for the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists, which advises property investors, including all major banks, said in an interview on Friday 25 April 1997 that there was no uncertainty caused by the Wik decision, and that, in fact, the High Court decision has clarified, for the first time, the rights of pastoralists. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Wik did was to confirm that there was certain rights held by pastoral lessees, they thought that they had something equivalent to freehold, but that certainly wasn't the case. Banks have always treated pastoral leases as less than freehold, a point that pastoral lessees seem to have forgotten . . . the rights that were held by pastoral lessees are unchanged as a result of the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the Howard government, with its amending legislation, that has created the uncertainty by making promises to pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to know that the government, the parliament, the pastoralists and the miners&mdash;anybody, in fact&mdash;cannot take away native title right found to exist in the common law by the High Court of Australia. The government, though, through its  Native Title Amendment Bill  is seeking to diminish the common law right of Aboriginal people. If this bill gets through unamended, it will certainly be challenged in the courts precisely because it goes to that point that I have just made. There will be, if this bill is passed unamended, no certainty. People need to understand that native title is not a threat to private or public property, to pastoralists or to the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I was for some time prepared to attribute good faith to the government on this matter. However, as I have listened to the debate over the last few months I have heard the assertions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the pendulum has swung too far in favour of Aborigines. I have heard the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, about this bill containing `bucketloads of extinguishment'. Last night I heard the outrageous comments of Senator Minchin that dissipated any re 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maining goodwill I might have had about the intentions of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, who is the man with special carriage of this legislation, went on national television last night and asserted that Australian homes were under threat unless the bill was passed&mdash;that even freehold title was under threat. I had presumed that Senator Minchin was a reasonable man. He is, by his own words now, a self-avowed unreasonable man. He is a man who has betrayed his own intelligence; he has certainly betrayed his own and his government's real agenda: certainty for some, but not for all, under their bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Laura Tingle writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> this morning, 27 November, had this to say about Senator Minchin's remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(It) is the most disgraceful act yet of a Government that has made an art form of the `big lie' on Aboriginal affairs ever since it came into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is one thing the High Court has explicitly, unanimously made clear about native title, it was its declaration in the Mabo decision in 1992: freehold land extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Laura Tingle is absolutely right. The government knows that its legislation is unfair, unconstitutional and unworkable. It will not produce certainty. It will not produce justice. It is the Howard coalition government that has persistently contributed to the hysteria and misinformation that has proliferated in the community over this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary debate before us is really about how our society, our legal system and our governments recognise the rights of indigenous people. It is fundamentally a question of social justice and it is about the process of reconciliation, of how we ourselves judge we can progress and go forward as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I was astounded to listen to the extent&mdash;not just the content&mdash;of this government's attack, from the Prime Minister down, on church leaders from every denomination who spoke out against this bill saying that it was racially discriminatory, unjust and unfair. The call from the House of Representatives member Mr Warren Entsch for Christians to boycott their churches took that attack against the churches one step further. It did nothing but discredit him. The churches have always 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9699"> claimed a right to speak out on matters of social justice. From my perspective, sometimes it has been a sadness that they have not spoken out more often and more loudly. But, in this debate, as in the 1967 referendum, the church leaders are well worth listening to. All of them have been at great pains to inform themselves about the matters of debate, the issues and the fine detail of the impact of this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to quote Mr Howard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to conceive of the factual base on which some church figures have attacked my government's legislation as being racist, discriminatory or immoral.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the Prime Minister knows, as we know, that the government had advice, via its Chief General Counsel, Mr Henry Burmester, as early as July this year, about how this legislation is discriminatory. It is interesting to watch how government front bench members of every level have ducked and twisted rather than give us access to or affirm the advice that had come to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also important to acknowledge the churches' right to speak out on this legislation because so many of those churches have also acknowledged their part in contributing to appalling injustice to Aboriginal people. They acknowledge that and they apologise for that. It gives, I suppose, an even keener edge to the rightness of their contributing at this time. But, most importantly, the rightness of their speaking is actually based on the efforts they have gone to to find out about this legislation, to find out the impact of it, to inform themselves of exactly what it is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope it is not the intention of the government to be racist. They say they do not wish to be, and I would prefer to understand them that way. But it is very worrying when, in the face of all sorts of most senior legal advice, Law Reform Commission advice, perhaps unsought, church advice and considered advice by scholars&mdash;all sorts of people who have examined this legislation thoroughly, who conclude that it is discriminatory, that it will disadvantage Aboriginal people and that it is therefore open to the charge of being racist, that still the government says, `Non 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sense, everybody has got it wrong except us.' It is time for the government to seriously take stock and listen, and in the end I believe the Senate will force them to do so. I would prefer that the government itself might have reached that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing to say is what I said in opening my remarks. I believe this piece of legislation means that I am alive and, by the good grace of the people of South Australia who have elected me to stand here, I am contributing to a decision that is historic. We do have an opportunity to make a case for the rights of Aboriginal people and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people in this country to coexist, to try to extend the process of reconciliation so that we really and truly give effect to what it means: that Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal brothers and sisters, men and women, sons and daughters, go together, as those hands so brilliantly symbolised, for the development and extension of this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a prelude to my address, I would like to say that my Deputy Leader, Senator Brownhill, from New South Wales, is in complete agreement with me that the government's 10&hyphen;point plan is the best response to the High Court Wik decision, but unfortunately, due to commitments and responsibilities he has to the trade portfolio, he is unable to address the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must pick up something that the previous speaker opened her speech with. If ever we have heard the warped or absurd, it was the previous speaker's making a comparison between today's events and those of World War II or the fall of the Berlin Wall, for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9700"> heaven's sake. No tragedy, no trauma, no loss of World War II can be equated to today's more humble events. Absolutely nothing in today's debate can be compared with the great events and infamous events of World War II, or the fall of the Berlin Wall, though no doubt that was a sad day for Senator Crowley. Nothing of today's debate can be compared with those shattering events. It really does show how desperately some wish to whip up hysteria on this issue and what false pretences they act under. The comparisons that Senator Crowley made really would be funny if the matter was not so serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to my formal address, it is now just over five years since the High Court historic Mabo judgment. That decision held for the first time that indigenous Australians have native title rights in relation to land that are recognised by the common law of Australia. There is no argument that the High Court Mabo decision was correct. Eddie Mabo's claim was legitimate. It is only fair that his possession of the land, and his ancestors' possession before him, should be recognised. The continuous occupation by his people really was in the tradition of the common law right of `possession is nine&hyphen;tenths of the law'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the previous government's response to that judgment, in the way of the Native Title Act 1993, that has raised the coalition's objection. The coalition said at the time that the act was inadequate and failed to address many of the uncertainties on the mainland arising out of the Mabo decision. The coalition identified a number of shortcomings within the existing Native Title Act that were a cause of great concern to Australian people generally. We knew then that the legislation was not workable. After four years and some 660 claims, the complex processes of the act have not yet led to the identification of any native title under the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The only native title determined on the mainland has been in the Crescent Head case, and that was extinguished with compensation by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of Victoria, the most prominent and sweeping claim is that of the Yorta Yorta people. The claim is to the north of the state, spilling over into New South Wales. It is an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> area approximately bounded to the north by the towns of Deniliquin and Jerilderie, to the east by Walbundrie, Howling and Chiltern, to the south by Benalla, Euroa and Rushworth and though the west by Cohuna and Rochester. For those who wish to get their maps out, they will find that this is a massive claim covering 20 councils and shires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yorta Yorta claim, made in 1994, epitomises everything that is wrong with the Native Title Act 1993, both in the spirit of the legislation and the mechanics of the legislation. For example, the obviously ambit claim is so frivolous in parts as to cause aggravation within the broad community. There are claims covering local sports grounds, recreation parks and bushwalking trails. The claims cover freehold land, local government land, crown land, Murray River frontage and the Murray River itself. The simplest understanding of the Mabo decision would conclude that the best part of the Yorta Yorta claim falls outside the criteria set in the original High Court judgment. To state one, there is the requirement to show continuous physical connection to the land claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yorta Yorta claim is proof positive that the mechanics of the legislation require an overhaul. For example, the claim was given in&hyphen;principle approval all too automatically. No information or detail was available to anyone who had a claim placed over them&mdash;as is the case with hundreds of farmers alone. Who and how many were claiming, and what was being claimed, was detail that was not initially made public. The uncertainty and feeling of unfairness at this stage of the process were sorely felt by those under claim. What is more, access to legal aid was not available to defend the rights of those under claim, whereas the opposite was true for the claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, to show the faults of the Native Title Act 1993, there is the Yorta Yorta claim. Nearly four years have elapsed, yet no judgment has been made. It is true to say that in this time local government, business operators and farmers of the area have been either extremely reluctant, or will not carry out any investment or maintenance projects in the area. The government's proposed amendments, while not denying the  Yorta Yorta 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9701"> people the right to claim native title, would restrict the right to within the High Court judgments of Mabo and Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Yorta Yorta claim was a particular Victorian case, for Australia&hyphen;wide it was last year's High Court Wik decision that made it imperative for the government to fix the Native Title Act&mdash;both in its workability and uncertainty in law. Succinctly, the decision said that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguishing native title, unless exclusive possession exists on the pastoral lease. Yet in 1993, the Native Title Act was clearly written on the presumption that pastoral leases extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To quote the movers of the act, firstly, there is the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the issuing of freehold or leasehold extinguishes native title . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Secondly, the then Senator Evans, who had passage of the legislation in this Senate, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think the short point is that the reasonable working assumption from just about everyone who has read the High Court judgments and understands the issues is that the pastoral leases validly granted do produce an extinguishment . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that this was the understanding by all sides of parliament, the Aboriginal community as a whole, and the rural community, is it any surprise that the Wik judgment created uncertainty and confusion? Therefore, the government's amendment bill has two aims: firstly, to reduce the uncertainty over pastoral leases; and, secondly, to simplify the native title process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's amendment bill has kept faith with the basic principle of respect for the Mabo decision and the common law recognition of native title. It then follows that the bill does not seek to go beyond the decisions of the High Court as to what actions have already extinguished native title. To be clear, we do not seek to extinguish native title. But it is in the interests of all to be certain about where extinguishment has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill confirms, in line with the High Court's judgments of Mabo and Wik, what land can be extinguished&mdash;for example, freehold land and pastoral leases 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that entail exclusive possession. For further certainty, the bill provides that the extinguishment is permanent. The introduction of this certainty will lift many of the frivolous claims now being made over freehold and certainly agricultural leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those pastoral leases that do not claim exclusive possession, native title can be claimed. However, in line with the Wik decision, the government's amendments state that a successful claim cannot interfere with the pastoralist's legitimate primary industry activities. The amendments I have outlined in no way diminish the Aboriginal people's scope to claim native title. The principle is intact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to deal with two other matters which are seen as being the most important but which are also riddled with confusion and inefficiencies. Firstly, there is the right to negotiate, which was put in the original legislation in recognition of the special attachment that Aboriginal people have to the land. It gives Aboriginal people a means of protecting their sacred sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original act states that the right to negotiate may be waived where the act will have a minimal impact on native title. But, because it has been impossible to define `minimal impact', the chance for agreement pre&hyphen;tribunal has stalled. In Western Australia, of the 1,910 acts that are subject to the right to negotiate, 148 have been cleared&mdash;and that is an eight per cent success rate. The obvious cascading effect is a freeze on exploration and development and a logjam created at the Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal changes are, firstly, that the bill retains the right to negotiate over crown land; and, secondly, the states will put in place their own regimes of negotiations, but they first must be signed off by the federal government. It is true to say that the right to negotiate will be streamlined. Certain future actions will be excluded from negotiation, for example, compulsory acquisition for third parties where the purpose is the provision of an infrastructure facility, like electricity transmission lines. All parties must negotiate in good faith. Presently, the legislation only requires the government party to negotiate in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9702"> good faith. There is provision for early ministerial determination. This will ensure that negotiations focus on relevant matters and that the involvement of the arbitral body cannot be indefinitely delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important administrative change is the threshold test for claims to be made. Currently the ability to make a claim is, in a word, slack. There are often multiple and overlapping native title claims. The claims are often spurious or frivolous, for example, claims on the Murray River or on areas of Perth. Also, claims are often far too general and uninformative. For example, some claims not only do not define the boundaries or the past and continuous connection, but there is no compulsion to identify all the claimants. Therefore, the purpose of the registration test is to ensure that only claims that have merit are registered on the register of native title claims. The conditions about the merits of the claim require the registrar to be satisfied that a prima facie case for native title has been made, and that procedures in making the claim have been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to raise another matter which is related to the native title issue: that is, the indigenous land fund. The fund, supported by this government, was established in 1994 with the purpose of recognising that for many indigenous people their native title rights had already been extinguished&mdash;for example, those who live in capital cities. The land fund is intended to assist these people acquire land. By the year 2004, the fund will have some $1.4 billion in it. Every year since 1994, $45 million has been dedicated to the purchase of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that this self&hyphen;sustaining land fund runs alongside or complements the ability of indigenous people to make native title claims. While I believe most Australians are unaware of this fund and would not object to the principles contained therein, they have a right to be concerned at the great many frivolous, ambit and even vexatious claims that are being made on native title. Such claims undermine the good intent and the purpose of the land fund. To many, it would look like a case of misuse of the original understanding.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there are no sectional interests here. Rather, the government's moves are for the country as a whole. All Australians are equal under the law. I do not believe the amendments are unconstitutional, although that claim will be tested. They are not racially discriminatory. They do not extinguish native title. They do not wipe out the right to negotiate. They do not abolish fair and just compensation, nor do they go beyond the Mabo and Wik judgments of the High Court. Rather, they enhance those decisions and represent the interests of pastoralists and Aborigines alike. The details of the legislation prove this. Our amendments are a much needed action for an ailing piece of legislation. I commend the amendments to the Senate.</PARA>

The main implication of the High Court's decision in Wik is that native title could possibly have survived on the estimated 42 per cent of Australia covered by pastoral leases. This decision essentially asserted that, while pastoral lease rights still prevail over native title rights, such leases do not signify the extinguishment of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , by contrast, is a blueprint for the unnecessary extinguishment of native title throughout Australia. It misconstrues the fundamental principles underlying the Wik decision in a blatant attempt to undermine the authority of the High Court. Such an approach demonstrates contempt for the independence of the Australian judicial system and is thus of particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past few weeks I have received letters from all over Australia urging me to reject this bill and thus the 10-point plan. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9703"> People from many different sectors of society are shocked at the arbitrary nature with which native title is to be extinguished. They are equally concerned that such a proposal could be put forward in the context of the need to maintain the ongoing process of reconciliation in Australia. The Native Title Act 1993 and the High Court's Wik decision seemed to indicate that both legislative and judicial bodies in Australia were supportive of the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are very concerned that this bill may threaten the status quo by diminishing the status of native title as a means of establishing land rights, thus alienating indigenous people. Under the government's 10-point plan native title would be permanently extinguished on areas covered by a pastoral lease&mdash;current or expired. This measure is supposedly designed to provide certainty and security of tenure for pastoralists who have been concerned by the prospect of native title claims in the wake of Wik. However, the extinguishment of native title in this instance is based on false assumptions with regard to the implications of the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court decision by no means authorised the permanent extinguishment of native title rights by pastoral leases. Hence, the government has chosen to misrepresent the facts as a means of justifying this most unjustifiable legislative proposal. The Howard government has capitalised on the fears of small rural land&hyphen;holders as part of its campaign to rally support for the 10-point plan. There is widespread apprehension among pastoralists concerning the potential implications of the Wik decision for land&hyphen;holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many fear that native title claims may result in the seizure of their property. These sorts of misconceptions have not been adequately addressed, and little has been done to explain to pastoralists how co&hyphen;existence can be satisfactorily achieved. Therefore, the Howard government has put forward a proposal that is based on false assumptions, and thus is fundamentally flawed. The rural community is being cruelly misled by a Prime Minister desperate to garner support for his most unpopular piece of proposed legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title illustrated the potential for the extinguishment of native title to impose a huge financial burden on the Australian taxpayer. It is estimated that up to 78 per cent of Australia has been covered by a pastoral lease at some time. Therefore, any consideration of pastoral leases has widespread implications. If all pastoral leases&mdash;past and present&mdash;constitute the extinguishment of native title rights, then compensation must be awarded on just terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extinguishment of native title rights in Australia on such a large scale would thus result in an incredible compensation burden for Australian taxpayers. The creation of such a large debt in order to enforce the extinguishment of native title seems excessive and unnecessary given the adequacy of agreements enabling the coexistence of pastoral and native title rights. More adequate reconciliation of these interests through negotiated land use agreements would be preferable to wholesale extinguishment as a means of providing lasting security of tenure for land&hyphen;holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also of particular concern to many Australians are the implications of the  Native Title Amendment Bill  for Australia's relations with other countries. Many ordinary Australians are concerned that our country's status as a civilised nation has already been damaged by the debate relating to the bill's passage through parliament. Countries such as the UK and Canada have voiced significant concern about the willingness of the Howard government to depart from international standards with regard to indigenous people's land rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also widespread confusion among OECD countries with regard to the reasons for the Australian government's seemingly inappropriate and contradictory response to the High Court's Wik decision. Our Asian trading partners are already concerned by the views expressed by One Nation supporters. The Native Title Amendment Bill seems to further substantiate international fears that Australia is being subjected to a significant right&hyphen;wing backlash at the moment. Grossly ignorant and ill-informed racist sentiments, as expressed by the member for Oxley, are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9704"> seemingly substantiated by a government willing to dispense with native title&hyphen;holders' rights to negotiate over land use. These factors, combined with the Australian government's reluctance to apologise in response to the report on the stolen generation, are contributing to an international perception of Australia as an increasingly racist nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the country that promoted its human rights record as a feature of its bid for the 2000 Olympics, it seems ironic that the Australian government is now willing to abandon our reputation as a racially tolerant society. It is time for the Howard government to really consider the social and cultural implications of this proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 signified a major turning point for Australian society. It demonstrated that Australians recognised past injustices to Aboriginal people and was seeking to make amends by putting in place a permanent legislative framework to prevent such injustices from ever occurring in Australia again. Since that time Australians have embraced egalitarianism and worked together to create one of the most harmonious multicultural nations in the world. As we head towards the next century, this government seeks to undermine our international reputation and negate the values of equality and fairness upon which our nation was built</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, Labor's amendments advocate coexistence rather than extinguishment as a means of solving disputes with regard to native title. The use of indigenous land use agreements is a means of implementing procedures designed to encourage a more cooperative and conciliatory approach to disputes. Such agreements offer an alternative to the extinguishment of native title by pastoral leases and would therefore remove the motive for ongoing litigation and animosity between claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of Queensland such agreements are already providing an effective and workable solution. An agreement between the Redlands Shire Council and the Quandamooka Aboriginal people has established procedures by which native title issues are resolved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by mutual agreement without the intervention of the courts. The Hopevale agreement is a similar arrangement between nine parties in Northern Queensland, including the Hopevale Aboriginal Council, the Cape Flattery silica mine and Telstra. Other examples of successful arrangements in Queensland include the Century Zinc, Alcan South Pacific and Chevron Gas pipeline agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that such agreements have already been established demonstrates that coexistence is an attainable goal. The agreements I have mentioned are all the more remarkable because they were established in the current climate of tension created by the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply saddened and ashamed to report that my home town of Ipswich is now in danger of becoming a community divided by Ms Pauline Hanson, who has not just encouraged but incited the sort of racial intolerance that Australia sought to overcome by introducing the Racial Discrimination Act. The situation in Ipswich at the moment may be replicated all over Australia if this government is able to override the act by introducing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely it has become obvious to most Australians by now that no matter who was here first and who got here later, we are all here now and we must learn to live together as Australians&mdash;not as pastoralists and miners and Aborigines and governments but as Australians. This being the case, any legislative proposal which unnecessarily disturbs the balance of multiculturalism and incites ethnic tensions is not just unfair but ultimately threatens the security of our nation and the stability of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another particularly disturbing aspect of the Howard government's attempt to enforce the 10-point plan involves the intervention of coalition members in the deliberations of the joint parliamentary committee. The committee was selective in its consideration of submissions and failed to address the concerns of all major stakeholders. The committee subsequently voted against accepting a submission from the Australian Law Reform Commission. Hence, in this instance the objectivity of the committee's final report was substantially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9705"> compromised as a result of the suppression of valid evidence highlighting criticism of the bill from various non-government agencies. It can therefore be concluded that the significance of any analysis of the bill's provisions emanating from the report of the joint committee is limited by the selective and arbitrary nature of the way in which evidence was collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of fundamental reasons why I oppose the Howard government's 10&hyphen;point plan as outlined in the Native Title Amendment Bill . The wholesale extinguishment of native title and the removal of the right of indigenous Australians to negotiate, constitute an unacceptable departure from current legislation designed to protect the rights of indigenous people. The government's misguided assumption that pastoral leases extinguish native title has formed the basis of a misinformation campaign designed to mislead land&hyphen;holders with regard to the 10&hyphen;point plan's capacity to provide ongoing security of tenure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aspects of the bill have been revealed to be unconstitutional and in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. Hence, the proposed legislation is destined to provoke extensive litigation, resulting in ongoing uncertainty for all stakeholders. In addition, the widespread extinguishment of native title would necessitate compensatory measures which would not be required under coexistence arrangements. Therefore, the enforcement of the wholesale extinguishment of native title would impose a somewhat boundless and unrealistic bill on the Australian taxpayer. Such excessive expense could be averted by a policy of coexistence, whereby native title could be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their attempts to secure safe passage for the bill through parliament, the government have constantly sought to mislead and misinform. They have conducted a scare campaign referring to non&hyphen;existent rights of veto and fears of land acquisition from pastoralists. These misconceptions have been compounded by a committee report censored by coalition members. As a piece of legislation, the bill would negate the recognition of native title established by previous legislative meas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ures. It would alienate Australia from the international community who have already registered their alarm at government responses to the High Court's Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, however, the bill represents a resounding rejection of the egalitarian and racially tolerant values of Australians in the 1990s. It therefore constitutes an insult to all Australians, indigenous or otherwise, who have sought to represent and support the ideals of multiculturalism. It is my firm belief that the majority of Australians&mdash;black, white and those of other ethnic backgrounds&mdash;genuinely want to live together in peace and harmony, respecting each other's cultures and beliefs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Mabo decision introduced the major new element of native title rights into the Australian system of property rights. The Native Title Act of 1993 was an attempt to manage the issue. However, the act was inadequate and unworkable. And I might say that that was a view expressed to me at the time by certain senior Labor people who were then in government. I was also led to believe, rightly or wrongly, that the then Prime Minister of the day, Paul Keating, made it quite clear that he believed that that act would have to be amended and, of course, this is what the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF>  does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the Wik decision, the confusion has increased. Early resolution of native title issues will remove major impediments to the development of the industries in the primary industries and energy portfolio&mdash;in particular, the mining and pastoral industries which are such significant contributors to the Australian economy. The government's amendments to the Native Title Act will provide the certainty sought by pastoralists and miners since the enactment of the Native Title Act and the announcement of the High Court's Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issues for orderly mineral exploration and development are, firstly, clarity as to who are the valid beneficial owners of property and the rights of those owners, whether the land be freehold, leasehold, crown or valid native title; and, secondly, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9706"> clear recognition that the Crown owns the minerals. The normal procedure is that exploration companies have access to land but are responsible for the repair of any disturbance, and informal arrangements are made to minimise inconvenience to either the explorer or the land&hyphen;holder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to mineral development, applications are made for leases and negotiations are entered into with land&hyphen;holders. It is not unusual for valuations to be made on the basis of `willing buyer and unwilling seller'. This gives independent valuers latitude to be generous to landowners. The vast majority of these negotiations are settled in this way. In the absence of successful negotiation, an independent arbitration is sought and, from my own experience over many years in Queensland, this was either a land court or a mining warden. At no stage is the perceived value of the minerals or the expected profitability of the mine taken into account. The decision by the court is made simply on the basis of detriment to the valid titleholder. Royalty is paid to the Crown and this represents substantial revenue to the community&mdash;estimated for the states to be in the order of $2 billion per year. The titleholder does not have the power of veto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill recognises native title; gives certainty as to validity, which has been a very major problem with overlapping claims, and we have heard speaker after speaker talk about that; gives claimants and those with valid native title exactly the same rights as apply to any other titleholder; and, where negotiations are not successful, it gives to a court the ability to make a determination in regard to compensation&mdash;which, I might say, is exactly the same as applies to any other holder of title. To claim that this is in some way discriminatory, is totally absurd. It does not take away rights. It gives valid native titleholders at least equivalent rights as apply to everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of misrepresentation in this debate, often propagated by people who do not have a great deal of experience of regional Australia. Mining companies are more involved in working with local and indigenous communities than ever before. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flow of royalties from mines fund Aboriginal development projects at the discretion of Aborigines. The Aboriginal community can grow and prosper in conjunction with the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a popular misconception that negotiations between companies and indigenous groups are a one-way street and that the mining industry wants to circumvent indigenous interests. This is simply not the case. The industry recognises that negotiated agreements are the best outcome for the industry and the Aboriginal communities. But both parties need a system that works, a system with the backing of a statutory procedure for when negotiations breakdown. As I mentioned earlier, in my own experience 99 times out of 100 that does not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes many of the impediments for the resources and energy industries imposed by the current act. It aims to facilitate the growth and development of resource based industries, which are so important for the future prosperity of all Australians. In particular, it provides for mining projects to be covered by a single right to negotiate process with valid native title holders or registered claimants. It enables exclusion of low&hyphen;impact exploration activity from the right to negotiate as part of a Commonwealth approved scheme. It supports and encourages the resolution of native title issues through the negotiation of indigenous land use agreements which will be legally binding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It validates where necessary mining titles over non-exclusive tenures issued between 1 January 1994&mdash;which was the date of the commencement of the Native Title Act&mdash;and 23 December 1996, the date of the High Court's Wik decision. It exempts from the right to negotiate the renewal of mining titles and it exempts mining industry infrastructure from the right to negotiate. It removes the right to negotiate from small-scale mining operations such as opal and gem mining, and alluvial gold mining and tin mining, subject to conditions. For mining on leasehold land where native title may exist, it provides for the states and territories to be able to replace the right to negotiate with state based processes, giving native title claimants and holders 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9707"> exactly the same procedural rights with leaseholders or even people with freehold, including compensation for any loss or impairment of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major concern for the petroleum and fisheries industries is the effect of claims under the existing Native Title Act over offshore waters. Some claims purport to exclude all others from the area and claim full ownership of aquatic resources. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  continues to allow claims to be made over offshore waters because the fundamental legal question of the native title status of offshore waters is yet to be decided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes any doubt about governments' ability to manage offshore resources. It makes it clear that governments can legislate for the management and regulation of water and aquatic resources, including fisheries, whether or not native title might exist. Governments can continue to regulate the fisheries and the petroleum industries and issue fishing licences and petroleum exploration and production permits. Native title claimants and holders are entitled to only the same procedural rights as others with corresponding rights and interests and cannot exclude others from offshore areas. There is no right to negotiate offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title processes established under the Native Title Act have proved to be unworkable. If anyone doubts that, they just have to ask the opinion of the previous Governor-General, Bill Hayden, in the discussions that he had on the Century Zinc projects. All interests now recognise this. The bill incorporates a number of improvements to native title processes. It establishes an effective threshold test for the registration of native title claims. That is important for people who have valid claims. It stops the muddying of the waters by those who do not have valid claims overriding those who have valid claims. Where there are multiple claims, the Federal Court will make a single determination of native title and in general will not consider subsequent claims. The bill also makes improvements to the provisions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representative bodies. It will establish a more robust system in which representative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bodies are subject to national standards of performance and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth repeating what I said in May this year at the time agreement was finally reached on Century Zinc. While the agreement was a triumph for perseverance, the fact the negotiations took so long is an indictment of the previous government's Native Title Act. As I mentioned earlier, we are well aware that Bill Hayden, who led the negotiations that finally obtained agreement on the project, was extremely frustrated by the processes required by the legislation&mdash;so much so that he made his concerns public so that future negotiations may not be similarly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years of unnecessary delay had a high cost: 3,200 direct and indirect jobs, many of them for Aboriginals, available during the construction stage of the zinc mine had been denied, in an area where there were few jobs, all because the system failed. At the end of the day, the Aboriginal communities of the Gulf received exactly the same $60 million package offered by the company back in August 1995&mdash;at a time, I might add, when it was thought that native title over the mine had been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unworkability of the Native Title Act puts question marks over the vital investment Australia has to attract. Investors must have certainty. The Century Zinc example shows that cannot be guaranteed under the present Native Title Act. The native title amendments must pass and operate as soon as possible to ensure that a farce like the Century Zinc case will not be repeated in Australia. It is worth noting that the size and value of Century Zinc enabled that project to bear the costs and delays resulting from the current Native Title Act. This is not the case with the very large number of smaller, less valuable projects that are currently required to meet the onerous requirements of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill responds to the urgent national need to restore certainty to native title processes and to resolve the uncertainties arising from the Wik decision. It facilitates economic development across Australia. It strikes a balance among the interests of all stakeholders by respecting the interests of native title 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9708"> holders, delivering certainty for pastoralists, reducing complexity for the resource industries and recognising the appropriate role for the states and territories. It meets Australia's need for native title processes that work.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the election of the Howard government in March 1996 we have witnessed the politics of division&mdash;not cohesion&mdash;in our society. The inclusive and nation building approach of the Hawke and Keating governments has been replaced with the politics of division and disconnection. Some examples of this are the Workplace Relations Act, which since its introduction has seen an escalation of confrontation in the workplace; horrific cuts to the public sector and their impact on jobs, particularly in regional Australia; attacks on the security of aged Australians and the resultant uncertainty created for those in need of nursing home care; tacit government approval of the racist agenda pursued by Pauline Hanson and her cohorts; and the 10&hyphen;point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) which, if adopted by this parliament, will be a gross denial of justice to our indigenous people&mdash;a people who have already suffered enough. They have been dispossessed, killed and had their children stolen and families destroyed. It is they who have experienced decades of discrimination and demoralisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only will it be a denial of justice; it will mean that we as legislators have missed a rare opportunity after 200 years of disenfranchisement to engage our indigenous people as an inclusive part of our society in a manner that sustains their culture, maintains their pride and upholds their dignity. Only when that is achieved can any government claim to govern on behalf of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 was a first step in achieving that inclusiveness. The High Court, in its historic Mabo decision, for the first time in Australian history recognised what we all knew existed: native title in Australia. A second step in the process was more recently the Wik decision, in which the High Court has recognised that native title rights were not extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease, that native title rights of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indigenous Australians can coexist with pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposed legislation seeks to diminish those rights. This is not the agenda of a government of compassion. It is a tragedy that this country does not have today a leader of vision with the necessary political maturity to deliver a political solution based on fairness and goodwill. This nation requires a legislative response based on bucket loads of compassion, not extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the decision in the Wik case is simple and already guarantees the rights of pastoralists. Native title and the rights of others such as pastoralists can coexist. The government and in particular the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, would have us believe that native title rights have been achieved to the detriment of pastoralists. Much of the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Wik decision of the High Court has been deliberately manufactured and promoted by this government, in cahoots with the rich mining lobby and large&hyphen;scale pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obfuscation, distortion and confusion are well&hyphen;worn political weapons which are deliberately being used to mislead the Australian public and honest farmers into thinking that Wik will affect them, that their right to use the land will be lost. The government are using fear and ignorance to promote their agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been further confirmed by the recent claims of the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) that freehold property could be affected, that the average suburban home could be under challenge. That must rank in the same category as Malcolm Fraser's `put your money under the bed' claim just prior to the 1983 election and equally as stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in Australian history we have a unique opportunity to define both the form and the substance that the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians will take in the future. This can be through a path of conflict, protracted court battles, racism and division at great cost to our nation, as would be the inevitable outcome of the government's proposed 10-point 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9709"> plan, or it can be an inclusive path of reconciliation, negotiation and preservation of human rights and the dignity of the individual within a cohesive society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A central tenet to achieving that outcome is the fundamental right to negotiate. It is therefore essential in any legislation passed by this parliament that negotiating rights are strengthened and preserved for indigenous Australians. This provides no guarantee at law. The right to negotiate is not a right to veto. It is a fundamentally important right, nevertheless, as it secures the participation of all parties in any negotiated solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's amendments failed to do this. The Prime Minister's 10-point plan is nothing but compulsory, forced, not consensual extinguishment of native title over enormous stretches of the country. Currently the right to negotiate in the Native Title Act 1993 is in recognition of the special attachment that indigenous peoples have to their land. It provides that, for acts relating to any significant change in land use, for example mining, and for the compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of making a grant to a third party, registered native title holders and claimants will have a right to negotiate before such an act can take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can only be described as reasonable to include an affected party in the decision making process. The experience overseas in countries such as Canada and the United States of America has over a number of years seen that, in conflicts over the use of land between native title holders and others, negotiation has been fundamental to achieving lasting settlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Canada the comprehensive land claims program was adopted by agreement of all parties in 1973. This program was designed to find ways in which indigenous Canadians can use land to become more self-sufficient in partnership with other Canadians, both corporate and individual, who have an economic interest in those lands. The aim of the program is to work out consensual agreements between indigenous peoples and government and other economic interest groups which all have a stake in the use of the land. This is a process of negotiation by consent with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> underlying principle&mdash;that of coexistence&mdash;similar to Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a process that has worked and worked well. In fact, in Canada to date they have negotiated 58 specific and treaty land entitlement claims, representing 205,000 hectares of land and $163 million; and five comprehensive claim settlements since 1983, representing 83,000 square kilometres of land and $230 million. It also recognises that the land has more than just an economic value for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to draw your attention to the findings of the distinguished academic from Toronto University Professor Peter Russell and what he had to say on native title. But, before I do so, if Professor Russell had been writing about native title in Australia during the debate, would he have suffered the same smears that our religious leaders have had to deal with from those on the other side for daring to speak out? Or like Hugh Kerr, a distinguished member of the European parliamentary delegation visiting Australia, who dared to address a rally outside parliament just a couple of days ago, would Professor Russell be accused of having an axe to grind, of not being independent? Would those smears be made on him? We would do well to remember that abuse is no substitute for a challenging debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what Professor Russell had to say about native title and the Canadian experience. He indicates that the payment of compensation for extinguishment of native title cannot be measured in just or similar terms. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By making that equation, it denies the unique nature of Aboriginal interest in land as recognised in common law. It is a unique interest that goes beyond,  above and beneath the mere material value of the land and has to do with the fundamental identity, collective and individual, of the indigenous people with their homeland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That dimension of Aboriginal title is not one that can been monitorised and simply given a cash value and bought out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For this reason, as Professor Russell indicates, the move in Canada and the USA has clearly been towards negotiation of agreements by consent. The Howard government's native title amendments do not include a process 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9710"> with a genuine right of negotiation for indigenous Australians but allow for extinguishment of native title by stealth, based on the premise that land or property rights have an economic value alone. This is both morally reprehensible and legally wrong and cannot and should not be allowed to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to reaffirm the importance of the six steps of coexistence, as recommended by Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation and supported by the Leader of the Labor Party, Kim Beazley, at the rally here this week. I want to particularly emphasise step No. 4 which relates to establishing a system for negotiating binding agreements. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people, pastoralists, miners, governments and other stakeholders need to be able to negotiate agreements about land use, in a system which is expeditious, fully supported by governments and under which agreements are backed up by statute.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In both Australia and other common law countries it is being recognised that legal disputes are a cumbersome and ineffective way of resolving conflict. The worldwide trend is towards forms of alternative dispute resolution. These are already being successfully used in Australia today in such environments as the Family Court, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Small Claims Court of the Local Court. These environments focus on settlement of dispute through negotiation and provide arbitration only as a last resort. This is a modern, conclusive and mature way to deal with differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my experience as a trade unionist, I know that the only way to achieve a lasting resolution to disputes is to negotiate an outcome that is sanctioned by all the parties to the agreement and to which they are totally committed. The right of all affected parties to participate in negotiations is fundamental in this process. If any party is excluded, then there can be no acceptance of the outcome let alone the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well understood in our society that agreements reached through a process of negotiation and recognition of the needs and rights of the participating parties and openly and freely entered into are much more likely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to endure. This is an inherent principle in the approach taken to dispute resolution in almost every forum in Australia today. If the Howard government is allowed to remove the right of negotiation for indigenous Australians then it is removing them from the process. If they are excluded in this manner then there can be no reconciliation, commitment or genuine agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act has already laid the foundations that are capable of resolving disputes and processing claims in an effective manner. This is seen through the many agreements that have been reached to date&mdash;such as the agreement between the Arakwal people, the New South Wales state government and the Byron Shire for joint management of a new state recreation area in Byron Bay. In addition, through a process of negotiation, agreements have been reached by Hammersly Iron at its Yandicoogina Mine, the Century Zinc project and the Chevron&hyphen;PNG pipeline project&mdash;together, worth close on $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 are firmly focused on the rights of pastoralists, miners and governments. For the most part, they ignore those of the native title holders. How can we have an effective resolution to the use of land subject to both native title rights and pastoral leases if one of the critical parties is excluded from the process? The answer is that it cannot be done and the Howard government is aware of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are designed to remove the rights of native title holders and secure additional rights for others at their expense&mdash;nothing less. The agenda of this government is to pay lip service to native title holders, ignore their rights and allow their title to be extinguished later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Respect for native title rights is fundamental to the reconciliation process. The government's amendments do not meet this simple test. They do not have the support of indigenous people and would effectively extinguish their common law rights. After more than 200 years of dispossession and demoralisation, Australia as a nation must reject the voices of prejudice, ignorance and hatred. Respect for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9711"> the rights of indigenous Australians is an issue for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo and Wik judgments reflect fundamental truths about the prior occupation of this country. They lay the basis for justice, not further injustice. The amendments to the Native Title Act proposed by the Howard government clearly are racially discriminatory as they remove the rights of one race in Australia&mdash;indigenous Australians. That is why these amendments require the removal of the Racial Discrimination Act's protection before they can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are tantamount to extinguishment of native title. The path of the Howard government is one that will lead to divisions within Australian society in a manner that will need generations of trust to repair. It is an attempt to secure additional rights for the few at the expense of the many, and it will destroy the forward thinking ideals and the reconciliation process. It has implications for all Australians and is nothing more than a gigantic leap into the dark ages of racism. In modern Australia this is unacceptable and must be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to these amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party are aimed at achieving a fair and acceptable outcome for all stakeholders. They build on the substantial foundations already achieved in the reconciliation process, and they should be supported. Australians are renowned for believing in the principle of a fair go. For me this has always meant a fair go for all, and in the Australia of the 21st century that must include our indigenous people.</PARA></SPEECH>

First there was the decision of the Waanyi case, which related to threshold tests; then the decision of Brandy, which said that judicial decisions could not be made by non-judicial people; and then there was the Wik decision, which said that pastoral leases did not extinguish native title. So we have had a successive stream of High Court cases which have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9712"> altered the understanding that hitherto had been held by the prior government and this government in relation to the effect of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not uncommon for parliaments to alter the law when decisions are made by a court saying that the interpretation is different to what was thought. Therefore, it is not uncommon for the government to be introducing this bill to remedy the situation&mdash;and the opposition acknowledges this with its hundreds of amendments in relation to this legislation. The opposition, when it was in government, amended the Migration Act as a result of High Court and Federal Court decisions. There is nothing new in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question relates to efficacy, certainty and enacting good law. Responsible governments are not about enacting bad law. That would be irresponsible. Those critics in the community who have criticised this government as being racist and those critics in the community who have criticised this legislation as being racist simply do not understand the issue. I point out to those people and to the nation's press that, although much remains to be done in indigenous affairs&mdash;that is conceded by this government&mdash;this government has still done a great deal in the first half-term of its office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my portfolio, which includes education and training, I would point to a number of initiatives which deal with indigenous Australia and which have enjoyed high priority. Our indigenous education strategic initiatives program is an example. We have committed an additional $80 million over four years to this program. More money will be put into indigenous education, from pre&hyphen;school to TAFE, and we have restructured funding arrangements so that we will target literacy and numeracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an English as a second language program. From 1998, funding will enable intensive English as a second language assistance for indigenous language speaking students from non&hyphen;English speaking communities to commence in schools for the first time. Each eligible student will attract a once only payment of just over $3,000 for intensive tuition, to assist students to reach a basic level 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of English communication so that they can function effectively in a mainstream classroom. The total cost to the Commonwealth is expected to be in the order of $6.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996 budget we committed $72 million over three years for indigenous higher education, including $21 million per annum for the continuation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support funding. We also applied $6.5 million for the establishment of a number of specialist indigenous higher education centres. Expenditure for training of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has been increased from $53 million last year to $65 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Abstudy there has been significant expenditure, anticipated to be around $130 million in 1998. We have recently varied the number of interstate trips and days away that students can spend in relation to their institutions, and some 1,500 indigenous students are expected to benefit from these changes. We are also undertaking a review of Abstudy in its current form, to make sure that it provides the most appropriate assistance. Consultations with indigenous people will be a feature of this review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education is an essential part of any community and any society. Training of our young people is enormously important. This year I was privileged to present the Apprentice of the Year award to Jason Jones, a young Aboriginal man from the Northern Territory. In 1994&hyphen;95, Labor's last full year of government, there were a mere 817 indigenous trainees, compared to this year when there are just under 5,000. This is where the government is working to achieve outcomes for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that those critics who call this legislation racist and call this government racist do not acknowledge these important initiatives. As I said, education is essential for all Australians, especially for indigenous Australians. It has ramifications for health, self&hyphen;esteem, advancement and empowerment of the individual. If ever reconciliation is to be achieved, it is by good works and not by empty words. This government is not about rhetoric but achievement. We are looking for positive outcomes for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9713"> indigenous Australians and we are looking for a native title system that works for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of Western Australia, where there has been much experience in relation to this matter, there has been uncertainty for the pastoral and mining industry. I might point out that there are a good many Aboriginal people involved in the pastoral industry and also in the mining industry. The progress of these industries will benefit all Australians, Aboriginal people in particular. Some of the best training schemes I have seen for Aboriginal youth have been provided by a mining company in the north of my state. However, such things cannot happen without development. So it is that this legislation is about outcomes. It is about making something work which has been unworkable for the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about this bill contravening the Racial Discrimination Act. The government denies that. The government denies that this bill is racist. Much has been said about the right to negotiate. I would like to place on record the fact that the right to negotiate is attracted not to a titleholder as such but to a registered claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate was a positive action taken under the Racial Discrimination Act. It was used in the Native Title Act in relation to the process of claims for native title and  has been a vexed issue in relation to the whole issue of native title. Much has been said about how the right to negotiate has held up the determination of native title and also the progress of mining and compulsory acquisition for public works. What has happened is that this right to negotiate has been afforded to someone merely by virtue of their lodging a claim. The Waanyi case reduced the threshold, as it was understood. It reduced the claim, so that you did not have to pass a prima facie test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At civil law if you conduct a case, if you take proceedings, there is a prima facie hurdle over which a claimant must negotiate his or her claim. What we are doing in this legislation is installing an appropriate threshold test which is in accordance with the law across this country and with the understanding of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that test as it was when the Native Title Act was originally passed in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is terribly important to remember, because the reduction of that threshold test has opened up the application of the right to negotiate so that it now attaches to a claimant who may not have much of a case. A claimant may not have much of a case but, using the right to negotiate, they  can still hold up determination of a matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point to another aspect which relates to the competing claims we are experiencing, particularly in the eastern goldfields of my state of Western Australia. We are seeing multiple claims from competing Aboriginal families and clans. That has bred division within Aboriginal communities. This was something which the previous government did not acknowledge nor foresee, despite the fact that we warned them that the way their process was set up would incite division and would not work. We have to streamline it, and we are now doing that, by saying to the Aboriginal community, `You have representative bodies and you can work it out amongst yourselves and then bring forward the appropriate claim.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a sensible thing to do. It will avoid what we have seen to date: the conflicting multiple claims and sad conflict in the various Aboriginal communities. It will also help hasten the determination because the hastening of the process will benefit all; it will benefit everyone. I have pointed to the fact that in four years there has been only one determination of native title and that was in the Mabo decision. That points to a system which does not work. The facts speak for themselves. In this bill we are making it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, if we are to achieve reconciliation, it will be by good works, not empty words. My area of responsibility is in the area of education and training. I believe this government has done a great deal in that area. It still has much to do, but we are doing it. There are aspects of health where Minister Wooldridge has embarked on great initiatives and Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, whom I am pleased to see in the chamber tonight, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9714"> has done a great deal in his portfolio in the area of indigenous affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the areas in which we can make a difference. These are the areas where we can achieve reconciliation. But it will not be by introducing legislation into the parliament that does not work. It will not be by raising people's expectations and then seeing them dashed. It will not be by promising them the world and then giving them an atlas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what we are about. We are about outcomes and achievements&mdash;the substance&mdash;not the rhetoric that we have been seeing in the nation's press. If the press were serious, they would report some of these initiatives. If the press were serious, they would report those areas which do need attention. If those commentators who call us racist were serious, they would take time out to understand this legislation and also to acquaint themselves with what is being done in the areas where it counts, such as education and health. This legislation is just one part of it. It does not diminish rights. It, in fact, protects them on all sides of the argument. After all, that is what good government is about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>   and I want to make it clear from the outset that I, of course, support the amendments that the Labor Party will move to ensure that this bill is not a racist bill, discriminating against a minority group within our community. I cannot get into the detail of the bill or the hundreds of amendments, but I do want to make some general remarks about why I believe it is important for all of us in the Senate to express a view on this bill, not just about the technical part of the amendments but also about the ethics and the moral issues associated with native title and about the style of country we want in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my teenage years and early adulthood, the great moral and political issue that I was involved in as a political activist was the Vietnam War and conscription. In the 1970s and through to the 1980s, one of the major issues that also drove me as a political activist was the political vandalism that had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been wrought on Australian society through the sacking of the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, in the 1990s, we are faced with the watershed issues  of reconciliation, coexistence and native title. Mabo and Wik reflect the essence of these three issues. If they are not dealt with successfully, this country, at its heart, will have a deep and continuing hollowness. Great nations and great peoples have as their basis a moral and ethical heart and it is incumbent upon us, as a national parliament, to provide our nation with that moral and ethical foundation. Unless we can achieve a just outcome for our indigenous citizens, we will have failed in that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as 18 million people, are extremely fortunate that as a nation we occupy a single continent. We are the only people in the world who have the luxury of having a whole continent to ourselves. But we cannot maintain a fully just and legitimate claim to our continent upon a foundation of continuing dispute with our indigenous population. I do not claim to have a close and detailed involvement with all the issues relating to our indigenous communities, or the development of legislative options to deal with the complexities of native title, but I do know that the issues surrounding this legislation make it clear that, as elected members of this Senate, we cannot shirk our obligation to reach a resolution which will be judged as an honourable, ethical and moral response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before I entered this parliament, I had developed an active interest in issues relating to human rights. I am proud to have been the inaugural chairman of the Australian parliament's committee on human rights. During that time, with other members of the committee, I was exposed to some of the most horrendous accounts of human rights abuses from throughout the world. For instance, I can remember a witness from the Sudanese Refugee Association who gave a horrifying account of slavery in southern Sudan as a result of an awful civil war that still goes on to this day in that area, and that was just one of the endless list of horrifying, gut-wrenching accounts that were given to us as a committee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we were considering the numerous abuses that were occurring throughout various places in the world, little did I realise that similar abuses had been taking place in Australia so recently. When I was reading the report of the stolen children <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> earlier this year, after it had been tabled in this parliament, I was shocked by the revelation that as late as the 1970s Australia had its own version of slavery. It is an ugly fact that we cannot escape or hide from and it is a shameful aspect of our history which we must acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not since I was a teenager in the 1950s reading William Shirer's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</EMPHASIS> and his chapter on the `final solution' and the extermination of the Jews have I been so moved or so overcome. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> was even worse because the barbarity was committed in Australia, by Australians and in my lifetime. Although it is an inadequate response as an individual, all I can do is say that l am sorry. I am sorry that the party I am a member of helped perpetrate some of the policies in government which led to a number of the atrocities that are accounted for in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These three simple words&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;remind me of an experience in South Africa some years ago. In 1991 I attended, as an official visitor in South Africa, a funeral ceremony just outside Johannesburg for 42 people&mdash;young high school students&mdash;who had been massacred during those turbulent times at the end of apartheid. There were 25,000 young black people present at this funeral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the people who spoke from the podium in front of the 42 coffins was Dr Beyers Naude. Naude was a white person, an Afrikaner, who had supported the National Party government of South Africa, and thereby apartheid, for many years. But eventually he found it impossible to deny what he knew was a fundamental and moral truth: it was morally wrong. He gave up the struggle between what he knew was wrong and what he knew he should do as a Christian. He was a church leader who was prepared to risk the wrath of a ruthless government and speak out honestly. He stood up for what he knew in his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heart to be right, knowing that his Prime Minister would be critical and might declare him a banned person, which he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the funeral he stood and addressed the crowd. In the most moving way, with tears in his eyes, he said, `All I can say to all of you out there'&mdash;the 25,000&mdash;`is three words: I am sorry.' It is a great pity that our present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cannot find the same ability to say those three words to our indigenous people: `I am sorry.'</PARA>

As a father, in a personal sense, I can express my sorrow for what other parents and children have been subject to; as an Australian I can express my sorrow for what we have done as a nation. I am, of course, powerless to undo the past; so, too, this parliament is unable to correct the wrongs of history. However, what we can do as a parliament is to act with integrity and honour and do what we can to ensure that the wrongs are brought to an end&mdash;we can act to ensure that the principles of Mabo and Wik are upheld.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great tragedy that we have a government and a Prime Minister who seem totally unable or unwilling to provide any real leadership on these issues&mdash;a Prime Minister who lacks the generosity of spirit to seek an outcome based on truth and justice, and instead seems to be determined to destroy the progress that has been made over the past few years towards reconciliation and co&hyphen;existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting on the last 12 months, it is impossible not to compare the sterile words of our Prime Minister on these issues with those of Lois O'Donoghue, Noel Pearson or the Dodson brothers. The contrast in eloquence and sincerity is immeasurable. Their words will last through the decades ahead, but our Prime Minister's will only ever be remembered as mean-spirited, narrow-minded, devoid of generosity and lacking in vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's amendments are a comprehensive response to ensure that this legislation will not shame our nation but will establish a shining monument of which we and our successors will be proud. Well into the future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9716"> it will be judged as having been an integral step in the process of reconciliation&mdash;a great step forward that was made possible by non-government senators standing firm in the face of a mean-spirited conservative government totally incapable of appreciating the importance of this issue to our national fabric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude on a broad theme which I believe expresses the very core of what all these issues are about. They go deeper than just our concept of land title. There is a symbolic importance of which we are all cognisant. Last year, in an appalling and indiscriminate atrocity, a young boy in Cairns was set alight in his schoolyard. Despite his horrific injuries and against all odds he survived that attack. His name was Tjandamurra O'Shane. His courageous struggle for life moved the nation. I was struck&mdash;I suspect like many others&mdash;by his unusual first name, and it was subsequently explained that he was named by his proud indigenous parents after the great Kimberley Aboriginal warrior, Jandamarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had only ever vaguely heard of Jandamarra, but on further reading I discovered that he was a great warrior with a great natural gift for guerilla military tactics. He was not alone. Through the last century there were many other Aboriginal military leaders who fought to protect their land. In the 1890s, Jandamarra fought to defend the lands of the Bunuba people from European appropriation. Recently, Sir John Gorton, a former Prime Minister, said that Aboriginal title did not exist; they did not understand private ownership. Jandamarra proves Gorton wrong. Jandamarra fought and died defending his land, that is, his native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year is the centenary of Jandamarra's death&mdash;he was killed on April Fools' Day in 1897 defending his land. And this mean-spirited government wants to mark the centenary of his death by passing what could be referred to as April Fools' Day legislation. If the legislation was not so discriminatory, not so divisive and not so full of uncertainty, then we could perhaps regard it as nothing more than a joke. But it is far more serious than that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course you will not find Jandamarra's military exploits recorded in any of our school history books. He gets no mention or place of honour in our war memorials. White society does not recognise him as part of our history and has conveniently forgotten his military exploits even though for a period of at least six years he conducted a successful military campaign against overwhelming odds in the Kimberley defending his land. The cynic might argue that we do not celebrate and remember the losers but that ignores the fact that white Australia is prepared to celebrate its most glorious defeat at Gallipoli with a national day of remembrance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jandamarra was a great Australian warrior who died fighting for his land, his culture and his freedom. We should celebrate the centenary of his death by voting to ensure that what he died for 100 years ago is established by this parliament&mdash;that is, Jandamarra's native title and the title of his successors. And this in a year when we have seen that the courageous spirit of Jandamarra lives on through a little boy in Cairns who carries his name. In the face of a most cowardly attack he has demonstrated bravery that his namesake would be proud of. Let us hope that we can reach an outcome that we can be proud of too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I conclude I want to make the observation that, irrespective of the outcome, this parliament will be making a determination on native title without a single indigenous Australian being able to make a contribution in this chamber or in this parliament by casting a vote. At the same time, every other interest of our white society is represented in this place and in the other place. This parliament, this Senate, will not hear the dignified words of a Lois O'Donoghue, the passionate commitment of the Dodson brothers or the soaring eloquence of Noel Pearson, and as a result our parliament is diminished accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with a quote from a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jandamarra and the Bunuba Resistance</EMPHASIS>, by Howard Pederson and Banjo Woorunmurra. This book, which only recently came to my attention, details the history of Jandamarra's resistance and his military exploits. What it points out is that white 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9717"> people wrote Jandamarra up as an outlaw and a criminal when in fact he was a successful military leader defending his people and defending his land. I want to read an extract from the book that certainly gives an understanding of Jandamarra. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The saga of Jandamarra and the Bunuba resistance is an epic story among many epic stories. . . . There are many Jandamarras who figure in the grim recital of Australia's colonisation.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bunuba people are still seeking ownership, management and access to most of their country. Some of the pastoralists whose leases occupy Bunuba land continue to deny the traditional owners access to their country. The State Government does not recognise traditional ownership and therefore refuses to entertain any joint management of national parks. The Bunuba are locked out of any real management of the lands they know better than anybody else. Windjana Gorge, Tunnel Creek, Geikie Gorge and a new national park that takes in much of the Oscar Range are state&hyphen;owned and run by public servants who live in Perth. Efforts by the Bunuba people to negotiate a major role in management for the traditional owners have been strenuously resisted by the State Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bunuba are still waiting for non&hyphen;Aboriginal people to negotiate with them on the use of their country. Until there is a negotiated settlement between traditional owners and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people today, who continue to benefit from the original invasion and dispossession, the past will remain unresolved and a shared future impossible to plan. The legacy of Jandamarra is the challenge for this nation to achieve a co&hyphen;existence of indigenous people and those who have come to live on dispossessed Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the concluding paragraphs from the book on the history of Jandamarra. They eloquently put the very nub of why the Labor Party is opposing this legislation. The Bunuba people have every right to have native title and access to their traditional lands. They have waited patiently for 100 years and they are still waiting. I hope that this bill is either defeated or seriously amended so that the Bunuba people can achieve their native title by negotiation. If this bill is amended by the Labor Party and other non&hyphen;government senators in this place, it will mean a major step forward for reconciliation and coexistence. I have to say that in the week ahead, when there will be many divisions, I hope that I will be able to vote and do my bit in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> memory of a great Aboriginal Australian warrior, Jandamarra, but above all else vote in honour of a very brave young boy called Tjandamurra O'Shane, who in the future offers us courage to go on with the job of creating a united Australia where we can all live together. I commend the Labor Party amendments to the Senate and look forward to achieving a great result for our indigenous people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go to my own remarks on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , might I commend the speech of my colleague Senator Chris Schacht as an intelligent and informed, sensitive and passionate statement. His comments about the Aboriginal warrior Jandamarra, who comes from the Kimberley region of my own state, Western Australia, draw to my mind a similar Aboriginal warrior of great renown called Yagan, who was declared an outlaw and a bandit and was murdered near Greenmount in Western Australia. His statue has now been raised in bronze on Heirisson Island, on the causeway crossing from South Perth to the Perth city area. I am sad to say that, as an act of gross intolerance, that bronze statue has been decapitated twice and now stands without a head on Heirisson Island as a classic example of the intolerance that operates in some parts of our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My speech will be less colourful than Senator Schacht's but, hopefully, I will be able to spend some time analysing some of the implications of this bill in greater detail. I believe that the government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is, in its current form, widely recognised as a flawed piece of legislation that will, unamended, end up in multiple legal challenges in the High Court of Australia. The bill before the Senate is without doubt a recipe for uncertainty. It is because this legislation has had to be navigated through the backbench of the Liberal Party and the coalition, whose every public presentation of views has demonstrated its complete ignorance of the legal framework in which successful legislation should be pursued, that we have this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor shares the government's stated desire for greater certainty for all stakeholders, for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9718"> greater workability of the Native Title Act 1993 and for the resolution of disputes the act seeks to address. The Mabo decision brought Australia into line as the last New World nation with a British common law tradition to recognise the presettlement laws of its indigenous people, giving rise, of course, to native title. At the time there was a need for clarification of the implications for all levels of government and all holders of post&hyphen;settlement titles, as well as for potential native title claimants. There were complex legal, social and economic issues to be resolved. There was the prospect at the time of innumerable common law claims for Aboriginal native title from indigenous people, to be conducted without a statutory framework and in the absence of a single piece of case law for guidance. The consequence was a lengthy piece of complex, costly legal action and a great deal of legal and economic uncertainty. The process had the potential to be socially divisive both within the indigenous communities and between the indigenous communities and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. Unlike most conservative political leaders across Australia, the Labor government accepted the concept of native title and set about devising a decent, workable, practical response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A key element of the response to Mabo was the Native Title Act 1993. The act was the product of extensive and inclusive negotiations with all stakeholders. The process was further enhanced by extensive research on comparable responses in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The government, we believe, has surrendered certainty for pastoralists and the minerals and resources industry, and decent treatment for the property rights of indigenous Australians, for a false backbench unity&mdash;a unity based on a fundamentally mistaken view of this parliament's legislative powers and an ignorance of the certainty to be found in the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act aimed to provide a swift, cost&hyphen;effective and less legalistic alternative to resolving matters on a case by case basis in common law actions. It established the Native Title Tribunal, and allowed for state governments to set up approved alternative processes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clearest immediate outcome from the act was the validation of every previously issued title for every existing titleholder. In particular, it validated potentially invalid past acts of governments, such as grants of interest in lands, since the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Simply put, the aim in a prevailing atmosphere of legal uncertainty was to achieve certainty, clarity and workability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drafting and passage of the act was carried on in the face of stubborn refusal on the part of the coalition&mdash;at the time, the opposition&mdash;to engage constructively in the process. It makes a nonsense, I submit, of the claims of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the flaws in the present act are the sole responsibility of the Labor government. Despite urgings by miners and pastoralists, the Liberal Party in opposition refused to participate constructively in that debate. Labor will not treat either the government or the country in that way on this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of conservative politicians simply rejected outright the concept of native title. They attacked the concept, and they attacked the High Court that had recognised it. The government at the time, the Labor government, took the view that the only lasting certainty for all stakeholders was that which came from consensus; any party aggrieved by the process or the outcome would challenge matters in the courts. That was what Labor's Native Title Act was designed to achieve. Labor's Native Title Act did not create rights; it created a mechanism for recognising and protecting native title rights that had been given recognition by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples where agreements have been made under the framework of our original bill. In Western Australia the Kimberley Land Council has negotiated over 30 agreements, on behalf of native title holders, covering cultural protection, mining and exploration, tourism, aquiculture, and major capital works. Again in Western Australia, Anaconda Nickel negotiated the Murrin Murrin agreements with local Aboriginal communities, showing that cooperation between all stakeholders can, and does, work. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9719"> Negotiations were carried out between the chief executive officer of Anaconda and Aboriginal elders; as a result, several native title claims were settled without delay to the company's project timing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Murrin Murrin area, which is near Leonora in Western Australia, the company has now completed 23 agreements. They have also given a commitment to the training and employment of Aboriginal people to achieve a target of those people making up 20 per cent of their operational work force. But it has not only occurred in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland the Hopevale agreement between nine parties covers a broad range of interests and demonstrates how, with effort, complex native title claims can be resolved through mediation. That agreement is between the Queensland government, Telstra, the Australian Maritime Authority, the Cook Shire Council, the Queensland Commercial Fisheries Organisation, Cape Flattery Silica Mine, the Far North Queensland Electricity Corporation, the Cape York Land Council, and the Hopevale Aboriginal Land Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, I now challenge the government's claim that the native title legislation is a mess. Those examples demonstrate that is not true. The claim that the act has created a mess is not sustainable. The High Court recognised it. Labor's act created mechanisms for dealing with it. Labor recognised that native title must be recognised and cannot be legislated away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1993 act is, of course, not perfect. But the coalition opposed it outright in 1993, and chose not to contribute in any way, and moved no amendments. As the incumbent government, it is now their responsibility to improve it&mdash;not to make it more unworkable and untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me for a moment consider the possibility of legal challenges in the future. The Wik case is a common law claim. It has been in the court since June 1993. It is still there, with matters of substance related to it yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think of the 600 or so claims currently registered with the tribunal. The failure in the face of a High Court challenge of a badly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amended act&mdash;an act railroaded through the parliament by an unthinking government&mdash;would see all those cases and more clogging up our courts indefinitely. The pastoral industry might survive such an eventuality, but the mining industry would not. We could already be previewing a coming nightmare for the minerals and resources industry in Australia&mdash;and particularly Australian society in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the government's amendment bill. The opposition supports the principle that the time is right for amendment. It has always accepted that the original act would in time need to be amended in the light of practical experience in the tribunal and the Federal Court, and in recognition of new case law as it emerged. There are still many problems to be addressed: confusion over the meaning of the native title concept; the expectations that come about from the Mabo and Wik decisions; unsustainable claims, multiple claims and overlapping claims; the failure to set up appropriate state tribunals; and the failure to adequately resource the whole system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the virtual gridlock in the current situation in Kalgoorlie. With its maze of overlapping, opposing and sometimes unsustainable claims, it is impacting on mining, residential development and daily life in that area. It is a dramatic example of the need for considered sustainable change to the act in the interests of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the national interest that the act balance and reconcile, to the maximum possible extent, the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, and of all of the stakeholders&mdash;be they miners, farmers, or the Australian taxpayer. It is in the interests of all Australians that they not give up on the possibility of achieving reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate before us is about how Australians, our legal system and our governments recognise native title. The right to native title exists. Those rights have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights. They are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians. The issue is how to deal with them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9720">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution lies in recognising rights in an equal way, respecting Australia's tradition of European law and respecting indigenous law and native title. Both laws exist and are deserving of respect. They can both coexist. Coexistence can allow the mutual enjoyment of our land to be determined by discussion and agreement. In essence, it is about reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this nation is mature enough, compassionate enough and wise enough for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians to live together, indigenous and non-indigenous cultures to coexist side by side and the rights and interests attached to them to coexist. This government must come to understand that there is an overriding need to guarantee the constitutional validity of this legislation. That validity can be critically threatened unless it operates for the benefit of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to act in a fashion that upholds the essence of the original act places at risk things that must be done now to ensure expeditious access for commercial interests vital to our national economy. This bill is seriously deficient, and it requires substantial amendment. Our areas of greatest concern include the fact that the validation provisions exceed anything necessary for addressing any real or perceived problems flowing from the Wik decision. The bill is racially discriminatory because it takes away rights from one group on the basis of race. Its provisions, if accepted, would extinguish native title rights in some cases and diminish them in others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's measures purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title through past grants of exclusive tenure involve massive over&hyphen;reach. The legislation provisions, including the schedule, do far more than confirm the current state of the common law as asserted by the government. They involve the extinguishment of surviving common law rights. It is vital that pastoralists are permitted to fully enjoy all the entitlements they have been granted under their various tenures. Both the 1993 act and the Wik decision affirm that their rights extinguish native title to the extent of any inconsistency. We will support any amendments 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that give greater certainty and clarity to that reality. Any amendments that invite legal challenge must undermine certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where it seeks to introduce a sunset clause, this is simply a recipe for ambit claims and guarantees a return to expensive and complex common law claims after six years. This bill must be made more practical. It must provide a genuinely attractive alternative to common law claims. It must address the legitimate need of all stakeholders. Above all, it must be decent and it must retain the beneficial status of the original act. If it does not do so, it will surely fail in the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must assert the fact that the cultures of this nation can coexist. We can all enjoy our rights to our collective benefit in our own best interests and in the best interests of the nation. This bill is clearly not a bill that is in our own best interests and the best interests of Australia. This is the minimum achievable bill in a backbench deeply hostile to the concept of native title and deeply ignorant of the operation of the law of this nation in relation to it. It reflects surrender by this government to backbench pressure; it is not a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came to power saying that it would make the Native Title Act workable. It said that it would consult widely before it introduced any amendments. The Prime Minister has not consulted widely and, by being intransigent in his position, is forgetting his role in leading the parliament and the country through this critical debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's amendment bill is divisive and has potentially huge costs in terms of time, money and human suffering. The opposition has been advised that it is potentially unconstitutional, and still the government continues to withhold its legal advice on this question, which leads the country towards further suspicion of its motives. The Prime Minister has also been very slow to hit back  against the racist comments being made in Australia&mdash;to hit back against Pauline Hanson for one. He will still not apologise to indigenous Australians in line with the recommendations of the stolen generation report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the Prime Minister and the government should be showing leadership on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9721"> native title, it is now too sadly evident that they are not able to do so. In fact, they appear not to want to do so and are prepared to talk about race based elections. Australia's international reputation is being put at risk by the attitude of a government that has stubbornly continued to press ahead with a bill that will go on to be proven as racially discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We intend to cooperate with the government to overcome the problems that it has with its backbench to produce a piece of workable legislation. On behalf of the needs of this country for certainty and the desire of all Australians to achieve that certainty, we offer cooperation to the government. But, to achieve coexistence, to achieve reconciliation, it will require this government to move away from its political motivations and its scaremongering that currently underpin its approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chamber is in the midst of a debate on a bill which is capable of being concluded with some consensus and which is capable of producing an expeditious and effective result. It will require cooperation and some change of mind by the government to achieve a consensus based outcome. But, at present, that objective is not contained in this bill. So the opposition will not support the government's amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to send my solidarity on behalf of myself and my party to the tent city that is currently being held in Victoria Square in Adelaide this week. I salute those wonderful 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> men and women&mdash;indigenous and non-indigenous&mdash;who are committed to reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. I refer to women such as Sandra Saunders, Shirley Peasley and Nicola Guerin and men such as Brian McDermott, all of whom have played a vital role in the reconciliation process in my home state and in the formation of ANTaR and Women for Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago I was honoured and privileged to address the Women for Wik rally in Victoria Square in Adelaide. Like the sea of hands rally on Tuesday, there was an inspiring number of men and women&mdash;members of the community&mdash;who turned up to display their commitment to the principles of reconciliation. Women for Wik is a grassroots movement that exists on a national basis and includes all political persuasions, different ethnic groups, business and industry groups, church groups, the arts, different professions, universities, the rural sector and political parties. It is also linked with national women's organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the launch of Women for Wik in Sydney in July there has been a mushrooming of Women for Wik groups all over the nation, certainly in all capital cities and many other regional centres. Many thousands of women are involved, including Dame Roma Mitchell, the former Governor of South Australia, Jane Lomax Smith, our current Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Hazel Hawke, Caroline Jones, Margaret Whitlam, Ruth Cracknell, Jane Campion, Jan Chapman, Professor Marie Bashir, Anne Deveson and Rachel Ward. These are just a number of the many women involved in Women for Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to these women. They were inspired by Lady Deane's call at the National Reconciliation Conference&mdash;the call that Australian women should take the lead in putting the reconciliation process back on track. I am proud to say that the women of Australia have taken her at her word and mobilised one of the most powerful national grassroots women's movements seen in this country&mdash;certainly one of the most powerful national and grassroots movements we have seen since the Vietnam War, according to some commentators. I pay tribute to Lady 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9722"> Deane and to her husband, the Governor-General, Sir William Deane. Some commentators have said that he has at times provided a conscience for this nation. I concur with those sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I would like to take the opportunity to speak a little about the role of reconciliation in terms of native title. As we have stated many times, the Australian Democrats believe that native title is the cornerstone of national reconciliation in this country. I wish to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Throughout the long consultative process, the council, the composition of which includes indigenous as well as non-indigenous people, has developed some valuable principles. In short, the council sees reconciliation as dependent upon its vision&mdash;that is, a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and equity for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many people in this place&mdash;and certainly many thousands of members of the community&mdash;on Tuesday I went to the sea of hands rally. I was proud to be a part of that inspiring event, the second sea of hands rally on the lawns. It was inspiring because it served as a reminder&mdash;a timely one at that&mdash;of the great number of Australians who are committed to reconciliation and peaceful existence. It was inspiring because so many different sectors, many people and different religious groups were represented at this event. At least 100,000 Australians pledged their support by placing or supporting a hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am only sorry that the display of such hands in the Senate chamber this week was objected to by one member in this place. He objected, as is his right, to advertising in the Senate chamber. Honourable senators, I was not advertising anything. I was promoting, along with Senator Lees and Senators Allison, Bartlett, Woodley and Murray, peaceful coexistence. If we are ashamed of promoting that, we should hang our heads in shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I wear the armband in honour of peaceful coexistence and justice. I wonder if any senator would deny me or my colleagues this opportunity, because I will take an arm 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> band over a blindfold any day. Ignorance and fear should not run this debate, and too often it has. As a member of this parliament, I have been ashamed in recent days of some of the statements I have heard from some politicians and their determined ignorance about Aboriginal and Islander people in the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation is vital to the healing of Australia's spirit and to our maturing as a nation. This legislation threatens to undermine the reconciliation process. Reconciliation is about addressing disadvantage. It is about understanding the causes of disadvantage, the legacy of history and the dispossession of Aboriginal people. But most of all, reconciliation is about relationships. I am talking about relationships so poignantly encapsulated by the images of Gladys Tybingoompa and Camilla Cowley in front of the `Sea of hands'&mdash;that wonderful glorious picture&mdash;encompassed by the Jurrang people, who we heard about today in the Democrat party room. Their agreement to share access to the Scott Creek station in the Northern Territory recognises both their rights&mdash;the right of those people&mdash;and the pastoralists on whom that station is based. It respects both their rights and their love of that particular piece of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation is about the relationships such as those forged in the Democrat party room this morning between my male and female colleagues in the Australian Democrats and the visiting delegation of women from the Northern Land Council who had come to express their views on cultural aspects of native title and, of course, the proposed amendments before us. I acknowledge their women, land and culture statement, which Senator Bob Collins read during his speech on the second reading debate in the chamber on Monday night. I commend that statement to all members of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their message this morning reinforced what we have been told by many groups in the community. Only last night I was told by Jason Glanville, formerly the indigenous youth policy officer of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, `You cannot separate native title from reconciliation.' The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9723"> Democrats have heard this message; we accept this message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor can you separate the life and culture of the Aboriginal people from their land, and, in trying to do so, this government is striking directly at the life and culture of indigenous Australians. You cannot separate the stolen children and other shameful events from present disadvantages suffered by indigenous people. You cannot separate history from the present. If I hit you yesterday, don't you have some redress today? What is the statute of limitations on the invasion of a country or the massacre of people, on stealing their children and the loss of much of their culture?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the pamphlet distributed by Women for Wik states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can not bring the children (of the stolen generation) home, but we can ensure that their Native Title rights are not taken away.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unity in spite of, or perhaps because of, diversity comes from a heartfelt recognition of the Women for Wik statement. That statement is that any amendment of the Native Title Act which leads to extinguishment of native title is the end of the reconciliation process. The Democrats believe this. We are proud supporters of the reconciliation process and we vehemently oppose any attempts to undermine this process, whether it is through the spreading of fish and chip myths about Aboriginal and Islander people or whether it is the introduction of racist legislation and regressive laws into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the High Court Wik decision is really the next step in a series of measures that have come from this federal government which have targeted those most marginalised in our community and often have impacted most harshly on women. The government's response demonstrates a profound lack of respect for decisions of the High Court. Surely, that sends a message to nearly every Australian citizen about the surety of their rights as upheld in law. As Noel Pearson has pointed out many times, aren't these white traditional laws the very laws and traditions that apparently we are all taught to revere and respect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, as do my colleagues, that the Wik decision&mdash;the High Court's decision&mdash;was a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fair decision. It was a just decision. It was one that actually achieved compromise. No&hyphen;one should be in a position to resist this; no&hyphen;one should want to resist this decision. To many, it encompassed compromise, a sharing of rights and a sharing of access to land. It was about minimising conflict. Who can forget those joyous pictures of Gladys Tybingoompa in front of the High Court dancing at the outcome. It should have been a positive decision and one that the government could reflect on and respond to positively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that there are some parts of the Wik bill that are non&hyphen;controversial, such as the Brandy amendments, which all parties and indigenous groups have agreed are positive and necessary amendments. I might acknowledge most of them were proposed by, or introduced by, the former government. These amendments would have improved the Native Title Act. Instead, this bill is being used as an excuse by the government to extinguish native title. This government's amendments before us represent the single most comprehensive attempt by any government to dispossess indigenous Australians of their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main concerns that the Democrats have with this bill have been outlined on a number of occasions by my honourable colleagues. They include several main areas: the possible windfall gains from the upgrade of leasehold to freehold leases; actual and de facto extinguishment; the sunset clause; and the watering down of the right to negotiate. We do strongly oppose and object to any loss of the right to negotiate and we condemn the idea of a sunset clause&mdash;simply because who else's rights in this society are subject to a sunset clause?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this bill is dubious on a number of grounds, and the one that has been the main focus has been the constitutional ground. We know this because a number of reports, including the report of our very own Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, have found this legislation constitutionally questionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are not just relying on the High Court or constitutional lawyers to tell us 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9724"> what is or what is not racially discriminatory. We actually believe it is the responsibility of politicians&mdash;that is, of legislators&mdash;and these two chambers to make moral and value judgments all the time. We should not be in a position to refer the hard judgments to the judiciary. Clearly, in our view, the Howard amendments treat indigenous rights to land differently from those of other Australians, and we cannot, in all conscience, support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politicians make moral judgments all the time. Our job is not to second&hyphen;guess legal decisions yet to be made. This government has been clear. These amendments, by the government's own admission, depend on the races power to become law. What a sad indictment on Australia in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should acknowledge that there are exciting developments in the reconciliation process in Australia in 1997. I would like to commend to the chamber the recent publication of a document by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compact 98</EMPHASIS>. It is about young people for reconciliation. This organisation has committed itself to working in the area of reconciliation until that vision is realised, and they are documenting the tangible actions of its organisations and its members and friends and supporters. This document shows that young Australians care about the nation and care about its future&mdash;as I am sure all honourable members do. In this document they point out that this involves acknowledging past wrongs. It means rejoicing in the wonders of this land, including the peaceful and tolerant environment in which most of us have been raised, and celebrating and respecting our environment and our natural resources&mdash;the great land and sea of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that one senator, in his speech this week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is foolish to make native title into a single symbolic `totem&hyphen;pole' gesture expected to give solutions overnight.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But this is a totem&hyphen;pole gesture. This legislation is extraordinarily symbolic. In fact, I suspect it is more symbolic than some of us perhaps will ever know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill was an opportunity to respond in a constructive and positive way to the Wik 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision of the High Court. Instead, it has been used to undermine the rights of indigenous Australians and to emasculate some of the rights that the Native Title Act has provided. It is also an opportunity to send a message to the world; and this bill does go against international trends, with the rights of indigenous people to political sovereignty being popularly asserted all over the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been prepared to use, and I think quite rightly, international forums to call attention to human rights abuses in other parts of the world. But we must respond when the same tools are being pointed at us. I am sure that if our foreign affairs and trade spokesperson, Senator Vicki Bourne, were here tonight she would comment further on the international obligations we have as a nation and also the implications in terms of international laws and treaties regarding this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes remaining, I wish to return to the issue of young people and reconciliation. I note that many young people&mdash;whether it was at the sea of hands, or Women for Wik, or in the many faxes, phone calls and letters that have come to our offices&mdash;have expressed their opposition to this bill. They have put forward their voices in support of reconciliation. Their voices should not be ignored in this process. I acknowledge the National Union of Students and their poster which has just been released which refers to this bill. It quite accurately referred to this bill as the `final act of dispossession'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why continue to perpetuate injustice? Are young people of today going to have to explain to their grandchildren that this government extinguished native title? The Howard government is creating history; yet I am scared and concerned that it will be a history of which we will be ashamed. We should be looking to the future. We should be working out how we can nourish indigenous culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most indigenous Australians are actually under the age of 23&mdash;and incredibly young on average. A 1994 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey showed that many indigenous young Australians maintain strong cultural links, with more than half identifying with a clan, tribal or language group. More than two- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9725"> thirds recognised homelands where they had ancestral and cultural links and almost one in five spoke an indigenous language. I believe that many of these young Australians&mdash;indigenous and non-indigenous&mdash;have a positive cultural identity. There are an increasing number of individuals who have survived racism and dispossession who are successful role models to indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt some of the comments I heard in the chamber tonight&mdash;in particular from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Senator Ellison, when he said, `Of course it is important to ensure that we put money into education, training and welfare for indigenous students and young indigenous people.' But why is the government cutting programs like the CDEP? Why have we seen $48 million worth of cuts to Abstudy programs? Why have we seen cuts to legal aid and ATSIC? Why have we seen increased fees and charges for young people who want to enter education and training institutions when these very groups that we have been talking about&mdash;indigenous people&mdash;are traditionally not only under&hyphen;represented in these institutions but completely unrepresented in some cases?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really is quite sad to see that Senator Stott Despoja has chosen to continue the campaign of misinformation and misrepresentation with regard to the intent and effect of this government's <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF> . This bill responds to the community's call for certainty and the government's election commitment to restore certainty to native title processes throughout Australia. While the Liberal and National Parties accepted the principles behind the Mabo and, more recently, the Wik High Court decisions, the Native Title Act itself was identified as being unworkable from the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of last Monday afternoon, 676 claimant applications have been lodged with the Native Title Tribunal. However, in the five years since the Mabo judgment there has been only one native title determination on mainland Australia, resolved through the court and through long processes of negotiation and with $210 million of taxpayers' funds spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this time there has been uncertainty, disagreement and misunderstanding within communities as decisions, development and progress have stalled. In these five years lawyers and advisers have made a fortune. Scaremongers have whipped the nation into a frenzy, pitting black against white, black against black, white against white and country against city, claiming and counterclaiming and all the while muddying the waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government parties accept the Mabo judgment, which gave indigenous Australians native title rights under the common law. The government parties recognise the special circumstances of Aboriginal people and the need for a system of Aboriginal land administration. However, the previous Labor government's Native Title Act also gave the right for claimants to negotiate on future development on their land with regard to mining activity and compulsory acquisition for government purposes without any clear guidelines on who could claim, no deadlines 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9727"> on when to claim and no limits on compensation available to be sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there has been an appalling lack of development in the resource rich areas of Australia demonstrates problems in the exercising of this right to negotiate. Successful self-determination for indigenous Australians is linked to them taking their place in the national economy. This will not happen without amendments that tighten up the way the right to negotiate is currently applied. When negotiation rights hold development to ransom, the main casualties are Aboriginal people as well as the broader Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claims under the Mabo legislation all still stand and are yet to be resolved. The Wik decision raised new uncertainties when the High Court found, by the narrow margin of four judges to three, that pastoral leases, after all the assurances to the contrary, do not extinguish all native title. This effectively meant that nearly 80 per cent of this country would have to go through the time consuming and costly negotiation and litigation processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision said native title could coexist with pastoral leases. Coexistence has not been taken to mean just that traditional people can have access to pastoral lands for ceremonies, hunting, site visitation and similar purposes. It has actually been taken to mean that they have a right to have a say in respect of all development on the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen several legal claims by Aboriginal groups actually asking for use and enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of all others. At the negotiation table, the virtual effect of the Wik judgment has therefore been that, unless an agreement is reached that is satisfactory to the native title claimants, the development proposal on the land subject to claim has no hope of proceeding. This is entirely unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government gave a commitment to Australia that it would tidy up the mess of the Native Title Act. We have heard that our amendments to the Native Title Act extinguish native title on pastoral leases&mdash;and that false claim was again perpetrated by Senator Stott Despoja in her remarks earlier this evening. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was certainly the preferred action by the National Farmers Federation, but the fact is our amendments do not extinguish native title. Those who are seeking even further negotiation and compromise on this legislation need to be reminded that these amendments are already a massive compromise between pastoral interests on the one hand and indigenous interests on the other. By identifying exactly what functions in running a pastoral business are to be exempt from the right to negotiate, the bill confirms the Wik decision, which said that pastoral activities take precedence over native title activities. It gets rid of the possible and probable need to negotiate continually with the native title claimants on issues where clearly pastoral interests need to take precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall watching the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on 11 November. He made it all sound so simple for native title to coexist with pastoral interests. He painted a picture to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> audience, asking them to imagine more than 50,000 square kilometres of pastoral land, land on which only a few cattle grazed, and asking why Aboriginal people cannot just roam around on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating said that the Mabo legislation and the extended application of that legislation under the Wik determination simply give Aboriginal people common law rights and these amendments will take away those common law rights. The fact is that the Mabo legislation gave native title claimants statutory rights over and above common law rights, thereby giving them more rights than any other land-holder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate is not a common law right. It is not a right enjoyed by all Australians. It is in fact a right based on race given by the previous government's Native Title Act. Pastoralists do not have a right to negotiate. If road authorities want to build a road through land subject to native title, the government has to negotiate with the claimants in the hope of arriving at an agreement as to where the road will go and what amount of compensation will be payable. The amount will be determined by how much the claimants agree to accept.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9728">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In marked contrast to this, if the road authorities wish to build a road through non-native title pastoral land, they simply advise the leaseholder or land-holder and pay compensation which is based on the market value of the land needed to be excised for the road. It is clear that the right to negotiate enjoyed by traditional claimants has gotten completely out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For further confirmation of this consider that in many cases several indigenous groups are all claiming the same area of land. In South Australia, where there are 27 separate parcels of land subject to native title claim, each parcel of land has two or more competing groups making claim. Mining companies and governments alike do not really know with whom to negotiate. Once the rightful claimants have been established, the battle lines over compensation begin with enormous demands in terms and compensation sought. If these demands are not met there is a stalemate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All pastoral leaseholders and freeholders, regardless of race, have the right to negotiate with private developers. But in the case of compulsory acquisition by the government for infrastructure needs or for other public purpose or for mineral extraction the pastoral lessee or freeholder must accept the situation and surrender the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating the other night went on to say that his government always meant for Aborigines to be able to negotiate by all under the common law. He said that the right to veto was never intended and that if the traditional owners did not negotiate then the respective state's land minister could always make the final decision. Can you imagine that? Each time a state minister would step in to make a final decision they would be accused of being racially motivated. Then it would be off to the High Court again where a decision would be held up for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate given to Aboriginal people was left wide open in the hope that this right would be sensitively applied and based on goodwill. Many of us enjoy goodwill with our neighbours. We coexist in our home streets and we try not to impinge on the rights or lifestyles of our neighbours. If two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> neighbours get on and there are plans put, for instance, to extend a house, the other neighbours will not mind or they might even share the costs of building a common fence. With goodwill the project goes ahead. There may be some adjustments made and there may be some fair compensation agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if the neighbours do not cooperate, there will be appeals, the development application will be held up and eventually there will be arbitration. There will be a decision made and maybe an amount of compensation payable. In contrast, where native title is involved the negotiation remains open ended. This must not be allowed to continue. If a pastoral leaseholder is to co&hyphen;exist with native titleholders it has to be based on goodwill and a willingness to adjust to each other's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point 10 of the bill's 10-point plan refers to the setting up of indigenous land use agreements. Both pastoralists and native titleholders need to know their rights in respect of the land and, once the boundaries are drawn, be able to co&hyphen;exist and respect each other's rights to use the land. Without the boundaries being clearly defined in law, we cannot expect or respect any consideration between those in co&hyphen;existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions of privacy, liability in the case of accidents, use of existing property infrastructure and interference in each other's business are the real questions to be faced if we are to have co&hyphen;existence. Issues of security and privacy must be addressed. City residents will be unwilling to allow strangers, possibly with firearms and alcohol, into their homes or business premises. It would be a concern in the city, and it is an even  greater concern in the pastoral areas where the nearest police are hours away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goodwill and cooperation are not fostered when the right to claim and negotiate is applied and dealt with in a racially discriminating way. Under the current legislation, it is the pastoralists who have to accept or else disprove the co&hyphen;existence of titles. If co&hyphen;existence is accepted, pastoralists face the uncertainty of trying to thrash out negotiations&mdash;perhaps in the absence of goodwill. If they do not accept the claim, they face paying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9729"> the court costs in defending against the claim&mdash;in money and in precious time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an attitude that Wik only affects the big pastoral stations sparsely stocked with cattle. The reality is that every bit of spare land in country towns was originally a pastoral lease. Much of it then became government land or crown land. Since the Wik decision, there has been a rush of ambit claims on this land and prime development sites, often just for the possibility of large compensation payouts if governments become desperate to acquire spare land for public infrastructure and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point 7 in our 10-point plan provides for the compulsory acquisition of land inside cities and towns for the purpose of government type infrastructure. Native titleholders would gain the same procedural and compensation rights as other land-holders. This, in effect, means that the common laws will apply equally to all land-holders regardless of race and without discrimination. Aboriginal people were given a superior negotiating position through the Native Title Act and many have taken unreasonable advantage of that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greed has ensured that the Native Title Act has been unworkable. The massive claims on everything possible made it unworkable. The time taken for arbitration made it unworkable. The conflicting claimants made it unworkable. Genuine claims have been lost in the land grab.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uncertainty is very apparent in the mining industry, particularly in South Australia. More than 45 per cent of South Australia is covered by pastoral leases, most of which are covered by native title claims. Development and investment in the mining industry has been stifled by the uncertainty of Wik and the ongoing delay in the grant and operation of mining tenements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of native title legislation and questions resulting from Wik, the ability of mining companies to access tenements to carry out exploration has become increasingly difficult. The South Australian Department of Mines and Energy has not been able to grant new opal tenements on Lambina station. One hundred opal mining applications cannot be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealt with until the right to negotiate process has been completed. They are subject to native title claim because they are located on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mining applications on two gold and silver leases at O'Leary on the Wadnaminga Goldfield have been held up. In the Riverland, near Renmark, a company had a lease over a sandhill for the removal of sand. Because of the complexities and costs associated with negotiation over native title, the company has given up and has left the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The District Council of Le Hunte, on the Eyre Peninsula, has been trying to encourage the South Australian granite industry. There has been some very keen interest from Italy, with some areas being pegged for mining. This cannot go ahead until the negotiation process is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Gawler Craton, the most prospective mining area of South Australia, and probably Australia, several new mining discoveries cannot start mining because of native title claims. It was expected that these discoveries would have been in production by now, and it is feared that some of the companies involved are beginning to get cold feet because of the delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Coober Pedy a South Australian government and Indonesian joint venture planned to trial new technology that could turn fairly low grade iron ore and coal into higher grade product. It is now subject to a native title claim. As a result of that, the core samples needed to test the new technology cannot be mined. South Australia simply cannot afford to lose these opportunities because of the shortcomings of the Keating government legislation. South Australia desperately needs the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me summarise. Throughout Australia farming families need certainty that they can continue to run their properties. This will provide $27.5 billion to the Australian economy. Mining, currently worth $40 billion per year, is essential for economic growth, investment and jobs. This government wants to see Aboriginal people participate in realising the potential of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9730">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that 353,000 Aborigines, representing two per cent of Australia's population, already own 15 per cent of the country as freehold, leasehold or crown land. This is equivalent to 117 million hectares, an area larger than New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT combined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people can still negotiate to be partners with the mining companies and still lay native title claims on some 79 per cent of this country as a result of the government's proposed amendments. The Aboriginal land acquisition fund will continue to provide $45 million every year forever for Aboriginal people to buy pastoral leases and other land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title legislation is but one of the issues and policies relevant to the special needs of Aboriginal Australians. This government has done more for Aboriginal Australia in the areas of housing, health, alcohol and substance abuse, education and economic development than Labor has and we will continue to do so. It is this government's aim that Aboriginal Australians take an equal place in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is a fair and reasonable solution to the problems created by the High Court's decisions and the previous government's inadequate legislation. That is why the gross misrepresentation being perpetrated about its intent and effect is extremely disappointing. In recent weeks the rhetoric has reached a crescendo, fuelled by mischievous statements from the Labor opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed unfortunate that for political gain the Labor Party is prepared to peddle their fictions in the face of overwhelming fact. Perhaps it is to be expected that we would get such misrepresentation from the Labor Party. Perhaps it is also to be expected from their barrackers in the media. However, the many faithful Christian church&hyphen;goers, especially those from the bush, are entitled to expect better than they have been given by some of our church leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be too much to expect fair comment on this legislation from the various church so-called commissions for social responsibility and the like, whose pontifications are barely distinguishable from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar secular political lobby groups. But it is the responsibility of archbishops and similar church leaders, if they are going to exercise their right to speak, to do so on a properly informed basis. This they have failed to do and are therefore guilty of perpetuating and extending the misinformation about this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their theology is also open to question. One can understand and accept the historical links of Aboriginal people to the land in a secular sense and support sensible legislative recognition of this, as this legislation does. But it seems, at least in certain areas, that link is also imbued with non&hyphen;Christian religious significance. To the extent that this is the case, it is quite contrary to the commands of the Christian gospel for Christian leaders to be promoting such icons of non&hyphen;Christian belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not share the view of my colleague Mr Entsch that congregations should boycott their churches. The church is its lay congregation, not just its leaders. Fellow Christians should be seeking guidance to make their leaders accountable rather than boycotting them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was always going to be a very difficult debate because there are strongly held views by people on both sides of this chamber. If we cannot hold strongly held views in this democracy of Australia and express them in this chamber without being abused or ridiculed by anybody, then I think that the democracy of Australia will suffer badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the majority of people in this chamber, I do not understand the intricacies of this bill. I am the first to admit it. I am sure that many other senators would also. There are only half a dozen senators who have spent hours and hours&mdash;some over the last 18 months and some over the last few months&mdash;poring over the amendments, poring over the intricacies of the bill, who actually understand every single piece of it. We all understand the general thrust, but very few understand the intricacies of it. So it is not my intention to try to speak about those intricacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a comment about one or two things that have been said by previous speakers, including Senator Schacht, if he likes to stay for another couple of minutes. In opening the debate for the opposition, Senator Bolkus said very early in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, a bill of fundamental concern to them, is taking place without a single indigenous Australian sitting here with a voice and a vote.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those sentiments were echoed by Senator Schacht in a speech just before dinner this evening. The question I put to Senator Schacht is: why isn't there an indigenous person on your side of the chamber if you are so concerned? You have had 97 years of this federal parliament to elect an Aboriginal or indigenous person to your side of the chamber, and you have not done it. So for you to bemoan the fact&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have had your turn. Let me say that Senator Schacht made those claims, and if he is going to bemoan the fact that they have not got anybody on that side then they should look to their own 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> preselection methods, they should look to their own party and make sure that somebody is there. You have never elected an indigenous person to your side of the Senate. The Greens, who have spoken so strongly in support of the Indigenous Working Group, have never elected an indigenous person to the Senate. The Democrats, to this stage, have never elected an indigenous person to the Senate. The only party that has elected an indigenous person to represent them in this chamber is the Liberal Party. Senator Schacht and Senator Bolkus, who both got up and bemoaned the fact that there is no indigenous person to have a vote, should first look to their own party and find out why it has not happened. Senator Bolkus went on to say a number of other things which I will speak on at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the run&hyphen;up to this debate, which has taken a considerable time, the bill having gone through the House of Representatives first and then being introduced into the Senate, there has been a lot of public speculation, a lot of misinformation, and a lot of public debate in the media in particular as to what should happen to this bill. The media have also represented those people who they claim have some moral right or some knowledge of the way this bill is put together and how it will affect people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a rural person who has spent most of my life until I came to this place with my only form of radio being the ABC&mdash;and this government has funded the ABC for many years now in its role as an independent broadcaster&mdash;what saddens me is that this debate has seen the ultimate demise of the only independent broadcaster within this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the commencement of this debate on Tuesday night I listened carefully to the reports the next morning. The only people who were quoted were those who opposed the bill. Again, a later stage, when it came to television there was only a person who opposed the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example was the news only an hour or so ago before I came in here tonight. The first item on the news was an item of interest regarding the current situation in New Guinea and its Prime Minister. Whom did they seek to get a response from on the Channel 2 news tonight? Not the foreign minister, not the shadow foreign minister, but former Senator Gareth Evans. They chose to speak to him. He is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow spokesman on the Treasury. I do not know whether they asked him because Mr Brereton is performing so poorly as shadow minister of foreign affairs or whether Mr Evans is performing so poorly as the shadow Treasurer, but for one reason or other the only person they asked to comment on the situation was the former Senator Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That gives you some idea from just two instances. If you want another instance, I suggest that you play a re-run of the first question this morning on Radio National asked of Senator Minchin by Fran Kelly. Then see whether or not you think there is any bias on the ABC. It may only be my view, Senator Schacht, but I am deeply saddened by the demise of what I always considered was an independent broadcaster in Australia. There has been a lead&hyphen;up to this for a long time. Not only that: no&hyphen;one in their right mind could suggest that the media has portrayed the issue with any sort of balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht has invited me to speak of the role of the church and its leaders. I have been an active member of the Uniting Church all of my life, and still am.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the church, I was brought up in a parish and still belong to a parish where there are very few people who share the views of Senator Woodley and who share the views of their church leaders. This has been a very difficult time because it tests the Christian faith of those who belong to those individual churches and who do not share the expressed views of their leaders. I defend their right to say so; I believe they do have a right to express those views. But to subjugate the views of many parishioners, which has happened by getting comment only from church leaders, means that the role of the churches and the views of the people within those churches have been overplayed in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the views that have been expressed by church leaders certainly are not mine. I want to put it on the public record that they are not. I know they are not the views of many people who are involved in my own parish. It does not mean that the people in those parishes are without compassion. But if, in a democracy like ours, you cannot hold a different view and be able to express it without animosity coming in, then I think there is something wrong with our own society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I listened carefully to what Senator Andrew Murray had to say because I have a high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9733"> regard for Senator Murray. He is someone in the Democrats who has, on many occasions, given a different view about economic issues and a range of other issues. I have also worked with him on several committees. However, I was disappointed when Senator Murray introduced the subject of apartheid into his speech. I was disappointed for one reason only: `apartheid' is a South African word and that is where it should stay. I do not know anybody in Australia who does not abhor apartheid and always has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not once did Senator Murray say in his speech that the situation in South Africa was one where 20 per cent of the population were ruling over the other 80 per cent and where that 80 per cent had very few rights and privileges. The situation is totally different from Australia, where minority groups are nothing like the size of the minority groups in South Africa. Apartheid to me is where a small minority express their views and dominate and oppress a majority of people. That is what happened in South Africa. I would certainly hope that never happens here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I respect Senator Murray's views because I find him to be a very honest gentleman. He is expressing his views in much the same way as I am expressing mine. But there is no place in Australia for the word `apartheid' as a description of the way in which the Australian parliament is trying to revise its native title legislation. The term `apartheid' has also been used by one other spokesperson. I hope I never hear the word again because I do not think it does anything to further the debate. Certainly, it only brings ill-feeling, which is not warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There has been lots of talk about reconciliation during the debate. Reconciliation is a two-way thing. What disturbed me when I heard opposition speakers talk about reconciliation was that they then used the most inflammatory language about anybody who holds a different view on this side of the chamber. We heard Senator Schacht talking about a `racist bill'. How can you have reconciliation when you have one side of the chamber using inflammatory language and calling people racist? We have had members on this side being referred to as `racist scum'. How does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that progress the cause of reconciliation, because reconciliation is a two-way thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation is mostly in the minds of people. It does not matter what people say, you cannot change what is in the minds of people without a long process of education. While public statements may be made in relation to reconciliation, it is the minds of people that have to be changed so that reconciliation becomes part of them and so that their feelings towards their fellow Australians are feelings of goodwill and not of divisiveness, which we have heard in some of the comments that have been made today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The terms that have been used by those who are opposing the government's proposals do nothing for reconciliation. As a matter of fact, I think they actually retard the process of reconciliation. I hope that the committee stage of the debate, which is when all the amendments that are to be made to this bill will be debated, can be conducted and debated by people who hold strong views. It does not mean that either view is right or wrong. The process of democracy will decide which of those amendments pass and which of them fail. We are all subject to the democracy of this place. Introducing ill feeling and divisive words will do nothing for the process that we are starting tonight and that we will be going through in the next week before this bill is finished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Can I say on a personal note that it is not very easy waking up every morning and knowing that you have a particular position on a bill, which I have on this bill, where a lot of time and effort has been put into preparing it and knowing that some people on the other side are going to refer to you as a racist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent all of my early life living close to Aboriginal people. My children went to school with Aboriginal children all of their school days. In my younger days, there was a considerable amount of goodwill within our rural communities. I am not suggesting that in those times the indigenous people were well treated&mdash;because they just simply were not well treated&mdash;but there was a tremendous amount of goodwill by the people in my own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9734"> community towards those whom they felt were far worse off than they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very sad for me to say that I think that goodwill has been diminishing in recent times. It is diminishing because of the public speculation and the public debate that is sometimes carried on both in the print media and on television. That public debate does not allow people to get back and try to solve the problems on a local basis, as they used to in times gone by, with much less bitterness than is evident today. My own view is that I am very sorry that has happened because I had a very enjoyable time playing footy with people of Aboriginal descent in those younger days. All of my life, I have had some really good mates amongst those Aboriginal people. Although a lot of those families have moved on, I am sorry that that same goodwill does not seem to exist today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that it is not there but it does not seem to exist. A lot of that is brought about by the fact that much of the writing and media comment has been made by people who live in urban areas. I do not say that unkindly, but they do live in urban areas where many of them have less contact with people of lots of other races than we have in our rural communities. I hope for the sake of Australia and for all the people of Australia that that goodwill does return, because it is important. Let us remedy the mistakes of the past&mdash;because they were mistakes. But that does not mean that the goodwill cannot exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly does not mean that time and effort have not been put into this bill. It has been suggested by people opposite, the Greens and the Democrats that there was no negotiation. It was only a week or two after the 1996 election that Senator Minchin started talking to groups around Australia. It is now 18 months since that election and in the first six months a considerable number of Aboriginal groups all around Australia were consulted. I know a lot of people are not happy with the final result; a lot of people in the pastoral industry are not happy with the final result. As has been said before, it was never going to be possible to produce a bill that would introduce some certainty and that would please everybody. It was just never 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> possible. I believe&mdash;I know others do not share my view&mdash;that the bill we have before us has done the best that it possibly can to look at the interests of all people. The debate will take place, the amendments will be brought forward and the democratic process of this chamber will decide whether my views or the views of somebody else are right. I am quite happy to put myself through that process because no&hyphen;one has a monopoly on right or on being perfect in anything that they do&mdash;in this place or in any other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other things that I could say but I see that my time is drawing to a close. I can only conclude where I started: this is not an easy bill for this chamber to debate. There are lots of individuals who will feel the pressure as we go through the amendments over the next 10 days. There are lots of people on both sides of this chamber who will be under considerable pressure. All I can hope is that, by the time we come to the end of the debate and the decisions are made, people will accept those decisions for the manner in which they were made and know that they have been made with the best of intentions from people on both sides of the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I want to start by saying that I never thought we would hear statements like those we have heard in the last few days. I particularly refer to statements from the offices of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, and the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin&mdash;the good old `fear and loathing' statements. I used to wonder why it has taken until now for the government to bring out this ridiculous claim that somehow native title may take away the freehold backyards and homes of ordinary Australians. Why wasn't it raised before? If we look at how things have progressed over the last 18 months you can begin to uncover why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government started from a position of arguing for certainty for pastoral leaseholders, miners and developers. That was, they said, the only matter that needed to be resolved. But following the public emergence of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9735"> government's 10&hyphen;point Wik plan it all started to unravel. The 1O&hyphen;point Wik plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) started to come under greater public scrutiny. Questions began to be raised about whether or not the 1O&hyphen;point plan could even provide the security that the government claimed it would. As the public came to understand what the government was really doing, the louder the criticism of their plan became. Legal opinions said it was unconstitutional, church leaders said it was unjust and the public opinion polls said that the government had not got it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really what led the government to raise the freehold versus native title issue with regard to people's homes and backyards. It was and is a desperate attempt to regain public support for their position. But what a low, despicable way to try to regain that support. One could be forgiven for thinking that the government has taken these steps not just in an endeavour to get support for their 1O-point plan but to create a diversion from all the other things that have gone wrong for them over the last 18 months&mdash;things such as the nursing home debacle, the child-care debacle, their lack of industry policy and so on. One could go on forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach is almost a mirror of what they did with their announcement of the work for the dole plan when they were under significant pressure in another area. These diversionary tactics seem to be becoming a trait of this government. Rather than confront an issue and debate it on its merits they seek to create smokescreens, especially when they are in trouble. It is a gutless and leaderless approach and Australians should not buy it&mdash;and I do not think they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australians want from their political representatives is an open and honest debate, and more than anything else they want a resolution that is just and fair. Australia does not have a good history of being just and fair when it comes to Aboriginal people. It took a High Court decision to correct the doctrine of terra nullius. For over 200 years our law sought to pretend that indigenous Australians did not have cultures that dealt with issues of land management. Nor did our law seek to understand the spiritual and cultural attach 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment indigenous Australians have to their land. The Mabo case was the first step towards rectifying that blight on our history. The Mabo case made it clear that native title comprises a property right and that indigenous Australians have that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the Mabo High Court decision, in 1993 we in government enacted the Native Title Act&mdash;an act that respects and preserves native title but allows reasonable use and development of the land to continue. As has been said, the act is complex&mdash;it had to be&mdash;and it was probably inevitable that it would need to be amended, not unlike any other legislation that is new and deals with very complex issues. We have not pretended that there are not problems; indeed, we acknowledge that there are. But to resolve those problems we need a fair and equitable approach&mdash;not one that winds the clock back to pre&hyphen;1993. That is the course the government is pursuing, and the late Eddie Mabo's family must surely now be anguishing that his long, hard fought fight, won fairly and squarely, could be in vain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said from the outset, the Prime Minister says that he seeks to deliver certainty. He says he wants to protect native title. But he is pursuing a course of action that can do neither. There is evidence in the statements of many people. Submissions in evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which considered the constitutional aspects of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, made the following points. Mr John Basten QC, barrister at Frederick Jordan Chambers, Sydney, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 has given rise to serious concerns in the minds of those familiar with the issues of constitutional law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr George Williams, lecturer in law at the Australian National University, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill in its current form is likely and indeed will inevitably continue the legal uncertainty surrounding Wik and surrounding native title in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Ron Castan QC, barrister at Owen Dixon Chambers, Melbourne, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the very least, there is substantial doubt about the constitutional capacity of the Commonwealth to make laws in relation to Aboriginal people which are adverse to them, or which discriminate against them. Thus, the bill, if enacted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9736"> into law, will inevitably be the subject of substantial constitutional uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is obvious from these statements that the Prime Minister's claims about his government's bill are not true and that the bill will create even more uncertainty for indigenous Australians, mining interests and pastoralists alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the question of whether or not the Native Title Amendment Bill is racially discriminatory. Native title property rights are protected by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which was enacted by Australia's 1975 Racial Discrimination Act. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 10 of the RDA provides for equality before the law for people of all races. Enacting legislation to extinguish native title would detrimentally affect the property rights of one group of Australians . . . based on race, in that the property rights sought to be extinguished are only held by Indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That says it all in a nutshell. And, of course, the federal government has legal advice from its Chief Counsel, Mr Henry Burmester, which may well contain the same warning: that its Wik legislation would breach the Racial Discrimination Act. If it does not, why don't they make it public? Why doesn't the Prime Minister? Indeed, why doesn't the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), who is sitting over there, make it public? What have they got to hide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this is not just a debate about legal opinions; it is much more than that. It is a debate about the reconciliation of our past. It is about determining a moral and just outcome for indigenous Australians, and it should be an honest and open debate. Reconciliation&mdash;and this is something the Prime Minister doesn't seem to realise&mdash;requires the involvement of all parties, and that includes the indigenous peoples of Australia. It is difficult to see how the Prime Minister can claim to support the spirit of reconciliation when the bill he seeks to have passed by the Senate seeks to clearly exclude a fundamental principle and right of indigenous Australians&mdash;the right to negotiate. That is why so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many people within the community are speaking out against the Prime Minister's legislation. That is why so many people in the community are calling for a proper approach to this debate. I myself have received numerous letters on this issue from individual Australians. Not one of them has advocated the course that the Prime Minister is pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more notable members of our community who has expressed concern about this government's approach is the Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane, who in an address warned that past oppression and injustices toward indigenous Australians must be acknowledged and addressed or our nation would pay a price. Sir William also questioned the nation's commitment to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, claiming the jury is still out on whether Australia passed the test of a true democracy. The government has strongly criticised the Governor&hyphen;General for even daring to speak on this matter, but I think an observation contained in a letter to the editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 26 November probably sums up the situation very well. In part, that letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that our Governor&hyphen;General should even feel compelled to speak publicly is in itself an indication that things are seriously wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The significance of this statement is even greater when you consider that it was necessary for Sir William Deane to defend the right of free speech against John Howard's claims that the churches should not speak up on issues that did not concern them. Well, the churches have spoken out, and perhaps it is time that Mr Howard and his government started to listen. Mr Toby O'Connor, National Director of the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, stated in a press release today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Denying native title rights to indigenous people is certainly not going to solve the many other problems faced by rural communities . . . Legislation that resolves conflict by wiping out the rights of one group is not going to further the cause of reconciliation. Peace without justice is not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a letter to members and senators on 21 November, the National Assembly of the Uniting Church in Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government will gravely damage its claims to moral, ethical and legal integrity if it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9737"> pushes ahead with its Native Title Amendment Bill in its current form . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Catholic Commission for Justice, Development and Peace, in a press statement on 24 November, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns of rural communities will not be addressed but will be compounded by this ill-conceived legislation . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best solution is through mutual understanding, discussion and negotiation . . . which benefit all parties . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiation is the best way forward, not the abolition of rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even international organisations have expressed concern at this government's approach. Amnesty International, in a letter to members of parliament on 20 November, expressed its concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Amendment Bill . . . potentially breaches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and Australia's own Racial Discrimination Act (RDA).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Considering all of these views, and even if one agreed with John Howard's claim that churches and others don't have a monopoly over morality, the Prime Minister would be well advised to realise that he does not have a monopoly over the right to freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the misinformation campaign&mdash;the vested interest campaign. What could be described as one of the most disappointing contributions in that area is that of the mining industry. l would like to refer to a letter circulated to all members and senators in this place from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, dated 24 November 1997. In that letter, it says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industries, including the mining industry, have suffered for four years under the totally unworkable regimes prescribed by the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But that is somewhat hard to believe if we do as industry keeps telling to us do&mdash;and that is, to look at the facts. I took a look at the facts. In fact, I went to AMEC's own Internet web page to have a look at how they really were suffering. Looking at that page, I found that in the mining industry:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of exports of mineral and energy resources has nearly doubled since 1986&hyphen;87, rising in 1995&hyphen;96 to a record $33.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian mineral exports are expected to be over $36 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA's mineral production industry has risen consistently by approximately 5.5 percent per annum since 1991, to over $15 billion in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is nothing wrong with that. That is all good and great; all the more for it; all the better. But, of course, I am sure that Aboriginal people would not mind suffering to the same extent if they saw their rights doubling over that same period, or their rights increasing by 5&half; per cent per annum. I am sure they would look forward to that with a great deal of joy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the misrepresentation and misinformation of big business that concerns me. It is also the misrepresentations and irresponsible actions of some conservative MPs who are endeavouring to whip up a fear and loathing campaign within the community by preying on the fears and interests of particular groups of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example of this&mdash;and it is one in which I have a particular interest&mdash;is the issue of recreational fishing access to Australia's waterways, beaches and seas. It appears that some government members and senators are going around the country saying to Australia's fishers and anglers that, unless the Native Title Act is amended, they will lose their right to fish on the beaches and rivers of this country. Indeed, one senator, Senator Bill O'Chee, in an address to a recent Australian National Sportsfishing Association conference, said exactly that. But nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under section 212(1) of the existing Native Title Act, it is clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a law of the Commonwealth, State or Territory may confirm . . . that any existing fishing access rights prevail over any other public or private fishing rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Therefore, even if Aboriginal people were to be granted native title rights over rivers, beaches or seas, they would not&mdash;if the existing act was applied&mdash;be able to exclude recreational fishing access that has already 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9738"> been occurring. That is the case&mdash;and it is about time that persons such as Senator O'Chee apologised to people for the nonsense they have been peddling and for conning people into believing what they are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The keen interest in and support for the access rights of recreational fishers or anglers to private property, being shown by Senator O'Chee and his colleagues, are very interesting. I find it very interesting because it implies&mdash;and I think Senator O'Chee actually said this&mdash;that no-one owns the water in the rivers, and no-one owns the fish that swim in the sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all well and good. But I would be very interested to hear what Senator O'Chee has to say about all those pastoralists who currently have freehold title over land who will not let anglers access their property or beaches to go fishing. I do not see Senator O'Chee or the conservative MPs over there introducing legislation to ensure that anglers of this country get access to those waters to catch fish. No, of course not. What you will do is defend the right of those pastoralists to deny people that access. That is what you will do&mdash;and that is what you will continue to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I indicated earlier in my speech, Labor does recognise that there are some difficulties with the existing native title legislation. That is why we have 359 amendments that are aimed at ensuring this government does not take away the native title rights of indigenous Australians&mdash;does not take away their right to negotiate&mdash;but does seek to bring about certainty and security for pastoralists and for miners in a way that we all expect, and in a way in which we all want to be treated, using that age&hyphen;old principle of fairness and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we will be seeking to achieve. But we will not accept&mdash;and I hope the Senate will not accept&mdash;the path of divisiveness and injustice that is proposed by this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  because I am concerned that truth has become a casualty. The facts are being ignored by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many who should know better; and the reconciliation process is being threatened by those who have chosen to politicise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the great privilege over the last 20 months of being responsible for the portfolio of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I have met hundreds of wonderful indigenous people. Throughout Australia there are many outstanding indigenous people, living and working at the community level, quietly going about their lives. These people make a tremendous contribution to their communities. And this is, in reality, an important contribution to the Australian nation. I could tell you countless stories of the people whom I have met over this period. You would not know their names. The stories of these people do not make the newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven years ago, the current editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> commented upon how difficult it was for new players in the field of Aboriginal affairs to be accepted in the media as persons with a right to be heard. He noted that the leaders of 20 years ago were still quoted and accepted as leaders&mdash;and it is my impression that this largely remains the case today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that non-indigenous Australians must learn about the lives of those indigenous men and women who are working with such dedication to improve the conditions in which their people live. It goes further than just learning about their lives and work: non-indigenous Australians must meet them and come to know them so well, as mutual understanding and friendship grows. Again, it has been my great privilege to have made friends in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal firstly, however, with the truth. Constant claims are made in the media, and even here in this place by senators&mdash;senators who, at the very least, should have read the legislation and should therefore know better&mdash;that are patently wrong. I would ask people to listen carefully to what I now say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not extinguishing native title. After our amendments are passed, indigenous Australians will still be able to make native title claims over 79 per cent of our landmass. We are not removing common law rights from indigenous Australians. Despite claims 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9739"> to the contrary, the right to negotiate is not a common law right; it is a device which was introduced by the Keating government under the Mabo legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not breaking the principles laid down in the Mabo and Wik decisions. Currently, there are native title claims over 45 per cent of the landmass. There are almost 700 claims, and only one has been settled. Indigenous Australians make up two per cent of the population, and currently over 15 per cent of our landmass is in indigenous hands. These are facts that cannot be disputed. Yet, when they are raised, we are told to stop using the facts because they might alarm people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today those opposite became very excited about comments made by the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) regarding freehold title. Again, Senator Minchin was only laying the facts on the table. He was not scaremongering. What did we see reported in the media tonight? The government is scaremongering. I repeat what I said earlier in the Senate on this subject: the government believes that native title has been extinguished on freehold land and by the grant of residential, agricultural and other exclusive possession leases. That is why the government seeks to confirm this in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Labor Party have indicated that it will oppose that confirmation provision, even the confirmation that freehold has extinguished native title. The only rational reason for their position is that they think native title can coexist with freehold. If Labor are successful, claims will be able to be made over freehold land in the Federal Court, and we think they will fail. Whilst generally the High Court has said that freehold extinguishes native title, it has not decided a case directly on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who would dispute this fact, I would ask them to read the comments of Chief Justice Brennan of the High Court in the Wik case when he said that, if native title is simply suppressed rather than extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease, then in logic this could be the same for freehold grants. That is a fact. Our policy is that the enormous cost and social division of adversarial litiga 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion on claims over freehold and other exclusive possession leases should be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not forget that in 1993 Labor insisted that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. They were wrong then&mdash;they now agree with that, and it is accepted. They were wrong. What we are seeking is certainty in this legislation, and the only way to achieve that certainty is to put it in the legislation. While we are abused for speaking the truth, our opponents are spreading half-truths and outright lies and are resorting to hysterical sloganeering. They are misleading many well&hyphen;meaning people who really did not understand the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many people, for example, understand that Keating's  Mabo legislation was intended to allow indigenous Australians to claim just 37 per cent of our landmass? Under our legislation, indigenous Australians can place claims over 79 per cent of the landmass, and that is another fact that cannot be disputed. The logical extension of the argument that we should not place the facts on the table is that it is all right for those opposed to our legislation to tell lies but not for us to tell the truth because the truth might alarm people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been accused of being racist. In fact, Mr Noel Pearson has resorted to `racist scum', `capitalist swine' and `apartheid legislation'. At least he is being consistent, because in 1993 during the Mabo debate he abused the Keating government in a similar vein. He said that there was moral scurvy in the Keating government and that the Mabo document was slimy and useless. If Mr Pearson had a logical, reasoned argument, he would use it. Instead, his arguments are so threadbare that he has been forced to resort to hysterical sloganeering. That sloganeering is designed for one purpose only: to create a racial divide. He stands condemned for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media perception is that there is a united approach by Aboriginal people on native title, and this again is far from the truth. Native title has different meanings for  different clans and language groups. There is even objection by some groups to our aim to rationalise claims.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quote from a letter by the former Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden, AC, written on 21 March this year, when he finished his role as chief negotiator on the Century Zinc mineral project. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What became abundantly clear to me quite early is how complex, even confusing, the drafting of the relevant legislation is.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was referring to the original Native Title Act. The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities the legislation offers for outside manipulation of processes and for the adoption of measures which come perilously close at times to being extortion; the absence of any definition of who can be a claimant and the seemingly unlimited opportunities for people to register as such; the unrepresentativeness of some who register as claimants; the confusion and tensions which can become rampant as longstanding factions and family disputes within a tribal group manifest themselves at the expense of the issue to be settled; the jealousy and mistrust which can arise between different tribal bodies and which can impair negotiating processes. And this is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems which stop the . . . Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are the words of a former leader of the Labor Party, a former Governor-General and a former President of the Labor Party. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sincerely hope that the Howard Government is able to remedy these grave defects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reconciliation is far too important to be used for cheap, dishonest political purposes. As a government, we have a strong commitment to the reconciliation process based on achieving practical outcomes. There needs to be, first, an honest and realistic acknowledgment of the injustices of the past. Second, there needs to be a mutual acceptance of the importance of working together in ensuring that our differences do not prevent us from sharing equally in a common future. Thirdly, there needs to be a shared commitment to overcoming indigenous disadvantage and providing equality of opportunity for all Australians. Over the last 20 months this government has attacked that disadvantage. We have spent more on health, education, employment, housing and law and justice in that period of time than the previous government did. Over the next four years we will spend over $400 million more than the Labor government did in their last four years. That, again, is fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also achieving recognition that the Torres Strait Islanders hold a special place in Australian society. We have already legislated to give the Torres Strait Regional Authority control of its own budget and we have promised to introduce legislation to provide the Torres Strait Regional Authority with greater autonomy within the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I close, I want to refer to another claim&mdash;that the government has no sense of the symbolism of native title. I strongly refute that statement. The government recognises that land lies at the heart of indigenous existence. Indigenous people need their land to fulfil spiritual and cultural needs for traditional use, for living areas and for economic purposes. Perhaps the most important issue on the national landscape involving indigenous Australians is our current response to the decision by the High Court of Australia in the Wik case. The decision's complex interaction with legislation, including the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act, have produced major difficulties and uncertainties for state and territory land administration, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9741"> pastoralists, mining interests, other leaseholders and potential native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government sees it as essential to achieve an early resolution of the uncertainties arising from the High Court's decision. But we want to make it clear that we recognise and accept indigenous native title in Australia. After extensive consultation with all parties, including indigenous interests, the government released its 10-point plan&mdash;a framework for  responding to the decision. As honourable senators know, the legislation is before us. The plan is based on the non-extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases, meeting the legitimate concern of pastoralists while respecting the principles of native title. It is important to stress that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite claims to the contrary, our native title legislation does not extinguish native title on pastoral leases for indigenous people. The government's approach means that the possibility of coexisting native title is preserved over Australia's rangelands. On pastoral lease land, native title holders will have the same procedural rights as other interests in that land in relation to development. Indigenous people can continue any existing access to pastoral land. Contrary to some perceptions, common law rights in relation to native title are preserved. The right to negotiate is retained for mining where native title may be equivalent to full ownership, and there are greatly expanded provisions for negotiated agreements with native title holders on all aspects of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot expect to totally satisfy all interests, but we will promote policies in the national interest. We are committed to achieve just and fair outcomes for indigenous people, industry and government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset in this crucial debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I acknowledge the Ngunnawal people on whose land this great parliament has been built. In the next week the Senate will set the course of history as it amends the Native Title Act. In the words of Galarrwuy Yunupingu, on the Howard government's 10-point plan:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the final drive. This is the revisit to our waterhole to poison it yet again. This is rounding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up Aboriginal people into the valley and a final shoot&hyphen;out. This is the killing of Aboriginal men, women and children one by one . . . Our right must not be taken away ever . . . Without this right we will not maintain and practice what we practice now. We will be like a dead leaf in a river that floats up and down in the stream. We will be a bird that flies freely up in the sky with no foundation, with no law, with no song, with no story.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I say, `Let us hear the strength and sting of these words and the cry from the heart that they involve.' Business and political commentators have been equally explicit about the need to amend the Native Title Act. They say that Australia's economic development, no less, is at stake. At the end of the 20th century it is no longer acceptable to promote economic interests through violent dispossession. Instead, we use the law&mdash;hence, this bill and this 10-point plan. Our choice here in the Senate is to turn back the tide of dispossession by rejecting this bill or to add yet another weight to the scales of past injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two centuries the indigenous peoples of Australia have been racked with Old World contagion, shot, poisoned, enslaved, imprisoned and dispossessed of their land, their culture and their spirit. At first this was concentrated in the south, where the bulk of Australia's population and commerce is set, but now all eyes have turned to the north. This, we are told, is boom country. Population growth is going north. Mining is mostly north. Road, rail and port developments are north. New land and sea occupying industries like cotton growing, aquaculture and tourism have a great potential in the north. It is perceived, wrongly, that in the way of this progress stand the indigenous people. Certainty for this progress is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these times when dark deeds of violence or force flash onto TV screens around the world in an instant, a new formula for handling this problem, which the indigenous people present, is required through the courts, through the parliaments and through the police stations of the land. As Kenneth Davidson said in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would all like more certainty in our lives. But it has to be shown how the nation, not simply the rich pastoralists, gain by standing on the throats of Aboriginal people. Of course graziers promise to be magnanimous because, if the general com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9742"> munity accepts that it is magnanimity that allows Aborigines on pastoral leases, that magnanimity is an attempt to slide past Aboriginal entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet here we are deliberating not on magnanimity, but on how best to abrogate the indigenous peoples' right to the land in the interests of the onrush of development&mdash;how best to take more. It is against the taking of more&mdash;the more bucketfuls of extinguishment of native title&mdash;that we Greens will stand. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  We are keenly aware of the central role of land in indigenous life and culture, and the drastic consequences of dispossession. As the royal commission into deaths in custody put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the particular priorities with respect to land differ as between Aboriginal People, they are united in their view that land, whether under the banner of land rights or not, is the key to their cultural and economic survival as a people. It was the dispossession and removal of Aboriginal people from their land which had the most profound impact on Aboriginal society and continues to determine the economic and cultural well being of Aboriginal people to such a significant degree as to directly relate to the rate of arrest and detention of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The impact of dispossession is indeed profound. Our Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane, has commented that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those of us&mdash;both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous&mdash;who are now joined together in a crusade for true national reconciliation all know that we will not succeed until our nation has properly addressed and made significant progress towards resolving the current plight of the Aboriginal peoples in relation to practical things such as health, education, employment and living conditions. And how could it be otherwise in a context where the gap between the average life expectancy of an Aborigine and that of a non Aborigine is almost 20 years and actually widening and where Aborigines are dying from particular disease rates up to 12 times or more than those of non&hyphen;Aborigines? Clearly, we will not achieve reconciliation until we reach the stage where it can be seen that we are at least approaching the position where life expectancy and future prospects of an Aboriginal baby are in the same realm of discourse as a non&hyphen;Aboriginal one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Crucial to that reconciliation is certainty in the land for the indigenous people. This bill torpedoes that certainty. It erodes the tenuous Aboriginal hold on land even further, and the 10&hyphen;point plan should be defeated. But if, as the majority of non&hyphen;government senators 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have it, the bill is entertained for amendment rather than rejected, nothing less than standing strong on the indigenous peoples' own line in the sand will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If not vetoed, this bill must undergo a radical rewrite, and that is a hazardous path and one which I do not particularly like. The ALP has said that its rewrite will meet 90 per cent of the National Indigenous Working Group's recommendations, but I think that 90 per cent is not enough. What of the other 10 per cent? One major concern, for example, is the ability afforded by the government and, to a lesser but nevertheless very real degree, by ALP amendments, for leaseholders to change the use of pastoral land way beyond cattle grazing with no Aboriginal right to negotiate. This is the very heart of Wik&mdash;coexistence of native title with pastoral use&mdash;with its kernel of reconciliation of two systems able to exist in harmony side by side. Yet the bill effectively extinguishes native title on pastoral land because it does not afford that right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill allows land use changes, called upgrading of the leases, without any right to negotiate for the native title holders. That upgrading can include such things as irrigation, cotton growing, clearing natural vegetation, logging and offshore fish farming. Such pursuits will expand massively in the north in coming decades. To aid this development, leaseholders and third parties are to be given the right to, for example, construct dams and canals, extract soil and rock, and log and woodchip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP allows traditional owners to be consulted about lease upgrades, including about compensation, and the heritage laws are there to be invoked. But the bottom line is that the traditional owners, even under those ALP amendments, do not get negotiation rights. This is truly alarming. Here we have a prescription for myriad changes to land use right across the north of this country, with Aboriginal interests reduced to consultation. It is a recipe for powerlessness, inequality and long&hyphen;term disillusion or anger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Indigenous Working Group has said that native title holders, when faced with land use changes by pastoralists, should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9743"> be entitled to future act processes under the Native Title Act: that is, they should have the right to negotiate, and so they should. And where, in all of this, is the indigenous right to the waters, the seas, the traditional fishing grounds of the oceans? Why is native title not extended from the land to the adjacent waters? It should be; it must be; and this is the time and place for it to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But neither right, nor resolve, nor even power of persuasion can match the weight of disciplined party numbers. On this momentous issue, great sway lies with the ALP. Over there is the government with its 10&hyphen;point plan; here, the Greens line up behind the National Indigenous Working Group's line in the sand. I challenge the good heart of the Labor Party to move this way&mdash;not that way; to come this further 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs just one of us to give it the numbers. Clearly it is appealing to Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine has an enviable record of voting for indigenous interests right up to the Hindmarsh Island issue. But, on Monday night, while allaying no anxieties, he told the Senate that we `should be open to honourable compromise'. These are words of internal contradiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the indigenous people have already compromised greatly in responding to the Howard 10-point plan, where is the `honourable' in further compromise? Compromise what? The right to negotiate? The validation of past illegal acts by state governments? The plea by the indigenous women&mdash;and I will come to this in a moment&mdash;for `our law, our traditional hunting grounds, our environment'? So I call on Senator Harradine, too, to stand strong with the National Indigenous Working Group position behind their line in the sand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two other points. First, a word about the environment: cattle and other introduced species have caused vast devegetation, soil loss, water degradation and the extinction of native species in Australia's arid and semi&hyphen;arid zones. The much speculated boom in the north and the multiple use future for pastoral leases poses even more threats. Governments at state and national level would do well to heed Mr John Auty, the former senior scien 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tist from the Top End: unsustainable pastoralism where it occurs should be replaced by a very real national effort to restore the land and invite traditional owners to join in developing the job&hyphen;rich service and tourism potential of such areas instead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that it is essential that we find much better economic security for the first Australians. The United Nations says that Australia is the world's wealthiest country; yet original Australians are often amongst the world's poorest people because of their dispossession from the land. The wellbeing of all Australians demands that we heal this untenable situation. But where is the healing in this bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had wanted Tasmanian Aborigine Michael Mansell to give this speech, but the Senate refused permission. But, to put to the Senate in words I cannot find&mdash;in Aboriginal words&mdash;the disdain for the government's 10-point plan, let me read to the Prime Minister and federal parliament the statement of the Indigenous Women's Native Title Conference in Darwin two months ago:</PARA>

I was not going to speak if that was going to stop anyone else speaking, because I think the resolution of this matter is important, whichever way you come to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was involved in the native title debate that took place in this chamber at the end of 1993. I think it was the longest debate in Australian history. I was also very closely involved in the debate on the land fund bill, which followed that debate and which was to establish the Indigenous Land Corporation and the indigenous land fund. I was very lucky to have had the opportunity of chairing the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill, which gave me the opportunity to travel throughout Australia and meet literally hundreds of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note Senator Judith Troeth is in the chamber. She and Senator Chris Ellison from our side and Senator Barney Cooney and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9745"> Senator Margaret Reynolds were on that committee. Senator Lees was on that committee as well, I think, for one of the hearings. It gave me the opportunity to move around Australia and meet a lot of indigenous people not long after the Native Title Act had passed into law. There was certainly a lot of confusion as to what the Native Title Act would deliver to indigenous people at that stage. As I recall, that was towards the end of 1994, going into 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a lot of confusion about the provisions of the land fund bill because, to pick up a point that Senator Brown made, the land fund bill was a piece of legislation that effected, critically, about $42 million a year in terms of the money available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to purchase land&mdash;a significant piece of legislation in terms of the impact it could have and the betterment it could do for Aboriginal people. That was a piece of legislation whereby there had been literally no consultation outside a group of about seven or eight indigenous negotiators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to places like Darwin, Cairns, Brisbane, Dubbo, Kalgoorlie and Perth. Virtually none of the Aboriginal people we met in those discussions of the select committee had had any discussion or consultation about the provisions of the land fund bill or consultation in relation to the provisions of the Native Title Bill before it passed through this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of Senator Brown's predecessors from the Greens (WA) in former Senator Cristabel Chamarette made the point continually during her contributions on the Native Title Bill at the end of 1993, and again in the indigenous land fund debates in this place in 1994 and 1995, that the previous government, apart from its discussions with a small select group&mdash;I think they were colloquially called the `A-team' but have now become the indigenous negotiating party&mdash;had had very little consultation with other Aboriginal interests in the lead-up to either of those bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government have sought extensive consultations with a wide range of interests, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and other stakeholders in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process. I am quite sure Senator Brown does not think we have had enough consultation. Others, such as pastoralists and miners, might say we have had too much. I do not think we are going to keep everyone happy in this process, but to criticise consultation I do not think is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people would say that this government did not move quickly enough to try to resolve the uncertainty that flowed from the Wik decision. I think that as a nation we should be trying to find common ground in all of these matters. There is absolutely no doubt that the Aboriginal people of Australia are the most disadvantaged people as a race in Australia. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind or in the policies of the government that special policies need to be implemented to improve the opportunities, the living standards and the health of indigenous people in Australia. There is no doubt in my mind or in the mind of the government that providing access to land, providing recognition of native title rights where those have survived, and providing access to facilities such as the indigenous land fund are also very sensible and very good policy and must be kept in place and run effectively to ensure that that disadvantage is overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of Western Australia the provisions of the Native Title Act as it applies at the moment have not achieved that. I can say from my own experience from being in Western Australia both prior and subsequent to the Native Title Act coming into force that it has not worked. It has not worked for Aboriginal people in Western Australia. It has not worked for other land-holders in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to get distracted even though there are very important arguments about the size of mining exploration or mineral activity or exports. I think they are very important things because they develop wealth for all Australians and, very importantly, they develop wealth in remote areas, where many disadvantaged Aboriginal people live. So that is an important debate. But what I want to say is that we should be focusing on that common ground. We need certainty for Aboriginal people. We need certainty for pastoralists who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9746"> seek to make a living off the land. We need certainty for people who seek to extract minerals and other precious metals and gas from Australia as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, that develops wealth not only for white Australians or Australians descended from European backgrounds but also for all Australians, including Aboriginal people, and particularly gives them exceptionally good employment opportunities in remote areas close to the land that they are most closely associated with. I speak mostly from a Western Australian point of view because that is where my experiences has tended to come from, even though they are not as often as I would like them these days. I would love to spend a lot more time in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because I am limited by time I will contribute briefly to this debate to facilitate the bill and other speakers, particularly Senator Evans and Senator Lees. But can I say that having the existence of multiple overlapping claims&mdash;the particular case that springs most vividly to mind in my recent experience is the Anaconda Nickel project at Murrin Murrin near Laverton in Western Australia, where at last count, which was a month ago and it might have gone up since then, 26 overlapping claims had been made on one area of ground, coincidently over the nickel deposit&mdash;does not create certainty for any of the people associated with that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know the anthropology of that particular part of Western Australia&mdash;I really do not. I know a bit about the anthropology. I have read some long books about it. I have had the great privilege and opportunity provided by my position in this parliament to talk to a lot of people in outback Western Australia and other outback parts of Australia. So I do have some limited understanding&mdash;certainly not the sort of understanding that I know many people in the gallery would have on Aboriginal issues and their relationship with land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I find it hard to believe that all of the people associated with the 26 claims over a relatively small part of Western Australia at Murrin Murrin would have a prima facie, bona fide, genuine link with that land. I may be wrong, however. All 26 parties who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a right to negotiate over that area may indeed have a close, long-term, continuous association with the land, or any other association with the land. If that is the case, then more power to their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where you have 26 overlapping claims&mdash;and in many parts of Australia you have multiple overlapping claims&mdash;what I put to the Senate is that the Aboriginal interests that, in amongst all of those claims and counterclaims, do have the bona fide interest, the close connection, with that land have the potential to have those rights determined through native title processes absolutely submerged under a sea of legal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put aside the Murrin Murrin project, the billion dollar project, and the thousands of jobs it will create and the hundreds of jobs it is already creating for Aboriginal people in that area. I agree with Senator Bob Brown wholeheartedly on this. We really do want a mechanism that will sort out the legitimate native title interests. We want to be able to provide justice to those people who cannot get native title through that process, people who have been dispossessed, who have moved and do not have a traditional link with land but do have an historical link, as occurs where people have been moved&mdash;forcibly or otherwise&mdash;from land, by giving them access to land, which is what we did by moving a series of amendments to the land fund bill, supported by the Greens, while we were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Senator Brown, we look forward to talking to you about that bill when it comes for debate at some stage next year. We decided that the federal government at that time had made what I thought was quite a racist&mdash;I probably should not use that term&mdash;or a paternalistic approach to Aboriginal people whereby they said that you can only make a grant of land to people under the ILC if it was to a corporation. We moved an amendment that said you should be able to make grants of land from the indigenous land fund to any form of entity&mdash;be it an individual, a partnership or a trust or any other way that any other Australian could own land. We rejected outright the position that if you were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9747"> an Aboriginal you had to be a corporation and if you were a white fella it did not matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That justice has to be found. But you can only get that justice if you have a system that will deliver that justice through the Native Title Act, through the indigenous land fund act and through the other policies of government. There is no doubt in my mind, having seen the Native Title Act work, particularly in Western Australia, that it has stuffed up the interests of Aboriginals who are bona fide claimants. It has had a significant detrimental impact on mining and exploration activity in Western Australia. I have absolutely no doubt about that at all. It has scared pastoralists out of their wits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to sit down a bunch of employees of mining companies, a bunch of pastoralists or a bunch of Aboriginals in outback Laverton, Leonora or Meekatharra or any other places like that, around a race track, a bar or a camp fire to discuss these issues, I do not think there would be much difference between them. My plea to the Senate is to take out&mdash;to quote the word Senator Brown quoted from the conference of indigenous women in Darwin&mdash;the `hysteria' in this debate. If we take the hysteria out of it and look at the reality of how you seek to determine the rights of each of those groups of Australians, regardless of the colour of their skin, then you are starting to move towards a true reconciliation and a true respect for all of those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get us all out there sitting on that red earth and talking about these things, you tend not to find the sorts of differences that are created on the front page of the newspaper or on the electronic media from day to day. The issues become a bit clearer out there. I certainly pray that, in the ensuing four or five days in this debate, that approach will be taken. I wish the bill a speedy passage. I will certainly be supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  before us today can be called, quite rightly, the final act of dispossession. What we in this chamber do with this bill will determine more than whether Aboriginal people will be excluded from their lands and more than whether we make progress towards genuine reconciliation. It will determine what sort of country we want Australia to be as we move into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, this bill is not about the Wik decision handed down by the High Court on 23 December last year. It is about the failure of the coalition parties of this country to come to terms with the removal of the doctrine of terra nullius from our law books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At its heart, native title is about accepting and acknowledging the real history of this country. It is not about guilt. It is not about a black&hyphen;armband view of history, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to call it. It is about facing this country's past with honesty and with the willingness to address the injustices of that past. Let us be very clear about this. By accepting native title rights we are not bestowing anything upon indigenous Australians. We are simply restoring some of the rights that have always existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of June this year my family has been in this country for over 200 years. That seems a long time, but when compared to an Aboriginal family tree it is just a blink of an eye. While many early white settlers may have been able to claim lack of knowledge and lack of understanding of Aboriginal issues and of the link between Aboriginal culture and the land, we cannot. We have no excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992, just five years ago, the High Court of Australia handed this nation an opportunity in the form of the Mabo judgment. But, while the High Court has removed terra nullius from our law books, it did not and could not remove it from the hearts and minds of many non-indigenous Australians. That will always be dependent upon a generosity of spirit, upon a will to listen and upon a desire to open one's mind to change. The Senate now has an opportunity, by substantially amending this bill, to address the historic and continuing injustice perpetrated against the original inhabitants of the nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9748">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court gave us the building blocks to embrace reconciliation, not turn away from it. But what have this coalition government done? Their buzz words for what they want to do include `certainty' and `workability'. The question must be asked: workability for whom? Again we must ask: certainty for whom? Why must workability and certainty automatically take precedence over rights? For all the things that can be said against the present act, its main feature is that it represents the involvement of key stakeholders and, most importantly and most markedly, that of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there is a need for some changes. We have heard again tonight examples of the changes that need to be made to assist particularly in the negotiating process. The Democrats acknowledge that. Indeed, I think all parties in this chamber acknowledge that. But I do have to say here that it is obviously working very well for the mining industry, which, as today's ABS statics show, has seen a rise in investment post&hyphen;Mabo of 110 per cent, which is more than double.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, then, do we need those parts of this bill the government, and the mining industry, know will severely reduce the rights of Aboriginal people? Put this together with the attack on ATSIC&mdash;one of the first acts of this government&mdash;the cuts to Abstudy, the lack of an apology from this government to the stolen generations and the absence of a formal response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report and I believe we see a meanness of spirit or a lack of understanding; at least a dearth of compassion by those with the numbers in cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the debate which has ensued since the Wik decision is the manifest dishonesty from almost everybody on the government side of politics. It has ranged from misrepresentation of the decision itself&mdash;and just in the last day or so the misrepresentation of the Mabo decision&mdash;to scaremongering of the worst kind about what may happen in the bush if Aboriginal owners are able to access pastoral leases, to access their country. Let us look a little more closely at the facts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, after the Mabo decision was handed down and before the Native Title Act was passed by this parliament, the Wik people commenced their action in the courts. Clearly, every lawyer and Attorney-General in the country worth their salt was then on notice that the question of native title on pastoral leases was a live issue. However, the question remains: if indeed the Native Title Act 1993 had subsequently extinguished native title on pastoral leases, why then was the Wik people's court action not set aside or stayed? The reason is that the question of native title coexisting on pastoral leases was, until 23 December 1996&mdash;and the Wik decision&mdash;an open one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government have chosen not to admit that what they are really doing is adhering to Dr Hewson's position in 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we reject&mdash;we totally reject&mdash;the government's Native Title Bill because we believe it is neither a just nor a workable response to the High Court's Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe the coalition remain of that view and the Wik decision has been conveniently used as an excuse to undo the 1993 act as far as possible, as much as they can get away with, to pass the final act of dispossession, the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases, and to take away the right to negotiate&mdash;the compromise position reached in the face of the extinguishment of native title on freehold land. Clearly, the government's deception in this regard has been extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill takes extinguishment further&mdash;extinguishing or, perhaps more appropriately, dispossessing native title in a number of ways. Clearly the categories of extinguishing acts depart significantly from the settled common law. That is why the Democrats will be opposing schedule 4 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk a little about another aspect of the bill, and that is its impact on the environment. The land under pastoral leases covers some 42 per cent of Australia. Much of this is some of the most fragile land anywhere in our country. It is certainly some of the most marginal land that anyone is attempting to farm&mdash;more marginal land is generally classified as desert.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to upgrade leases through the primary production definition, and that will result in land being used for a range of new purposes: aquaculture; cropping; farm stay tourism; maintaining, breeding or agisting animals; taking or catching fish and so on; forestry operations; and horticulture, et cetera. In evidence before the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, Mr Jim Downey of the Australian Conservation Foundation said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I represent a group of people who have campaigned for two or three decades for the repair of Australia's environment. You know, as members of this government, the impact that this bill, if it passes the Senate, will have on those rangelands: intensification of uses and expansion of the definition of pastoral lease to primary production. The Prime Minister, on 28 April 1997, said that primary production is a very wide definition indeed. It allows for far greater uses than are presently allowable under pastoral leases and those activities will be able to be conducted `without let or hindrance from native title holders or indeed any other section of the Australian community'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, that is an environmental disaster for Australia's rangelands, certainly for the 42 per cent under pastoral lease, and the bill also has implications for the 23 per cent within conservation reserves and crown reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This proposal has correctly been labelled by the ACF as the most radical change to Australia's land management policy since colonisation. It will remove the public's interest in management of the land&mdash;land which, I remind the Senate, is publicly owned. It will also enable wholesale land clearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that? Let us look at a 1995 CSIRO report that showed that national land clearing rates on freehold are twice the rate for leasehold land. Obviously, if you are going to plant a crop or establish an aquaculture venture there is more than a slim chance that you are going to have to clear some land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already in Queensland we clear around 300,000 hectares each year at least. If this bill goes through unamended, that will dramatically increase. Soil erosion will increase; loss of native species will increase; and land will become even more marginal. This increase in the range of permissible activities will reduce the level of control government has to act in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the public interest and to protect the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why this upgrading? Well, apart from the obvious windfall gain for the pastoralists, it is because of the increased conflict with native title claims. I go back to the Wik decision. It said clearly that if there is any conflict between the pastoral lease and native title then the pastoral lease prevails. This means that, rather than just having to fit in with the needs of the farmer or the pastoralist to graze stock with requirements such as fencing or perhaps a dam, if this bill passes without amendment there is now the possibility of a whole new range of conflicts, a significant increase in the potential for conflict&mdash;conflict with land clearing, conflict with cropping&mdash;and possibly with the irrigation provisions that go with it. `No, you cannot access that land. No, you cannot walk across that land. We are now using it for cotton.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you can go on: conflict with aquaculture and all that infrastructure; in particular, conflict with `farm stay' tourism. The tourists obviously are going to want to use sites such as creeks, dams or waterholes&mdash;perhaps look at  cave formations and visit sites such as chasms and mountains. Then that conflict will obviously be there if Aboriginal people also want to access some of those areas&mdash;a conflict with the accommodation that tourists are going to require and from their need to move around the property. So what the government is basically wanting to do is to increase the likelihood of conflict&mdash;and so the inability of native title holders to claim native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my time in this chamber I have had the privilege of meeting a large number of Aboriginal women, and I just want to mention a few of them tonight: Barb Flick, formerly the AMA's Aboriginal Health Adviser and now with the Cape York Health Council; Lois O'Donoghue, former head of ATSIC; Jacqui Katona, executive officer of the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation; and, of course, the Ngarrindjeri women of my home state, who are still fighting for their culture, for their lands&mdash;for Kumarangk and the Coorong beyond. I must add that they are fighting against very powerful and well organised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9750"> opponents, well financed forces that will stop at nothing to quash their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During discussions on this bill I have had the opportunity to meet many more indigenous Australians, and I congratulate them on their determination and their commitment as they express so powerfully their needs, their rights and the beliefs of their peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to say that I am struck on this occasion by the public support and emotion in the wider community. In all my experience in politics, in all my eight years, I have never detected such community abhorrence for what a government is attempting to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to congratulate the many non&hyphen;indigenous Australians who are working to protect the rights of their fellow Australians. Again, I just mention a few: the Kumarangk Coalition who are working with the Ngarrindjeri people to protect their rights and to stop the bridge to Hindmarsh Island; the Women for Wik, a strong and growing group of women  from all walks of life and cultural backgrounds, inspired by Lady Deane; ANTaR&mdash;Australians for Native Title, who have been coordinating those who oppose the legislation we have before us tonight. They have organised meetings and rallies across Australia and have put together the sea of hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today on ABC Radio, Barb Flick, Director of the Cape York Health Council, spoke in reply to remarks made by a pastoralist, Rosemary Wilson. Mrs Wilson had detailed how she and other prominent members of the Anglican Church near Collarenebri were boycotting church services because of the church's position in opposing the Wik legislation. Recalling her childhood in Collarenebri, Barb said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pastoralists of Collarenebri really behaved, in my mind, like the Scarlett O'Haras of the deep South in America. I remember vividly as a child that we had to wait in shops until all the white people were served. I remember vividly, in Collarenebri, where we were roped off like cattle in the picture theatres because people thought that sitting next to us wasn't a very nice thing to do . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember in Collarenebri the stories about my parents' generation who were denied an education because the Rosemary Wilsons had threatened the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Education Department that they wouldn't send their own children to school if the Aboriginal children attended.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have been given two other examples of that today where this is still happening in Western Australia. These kinds of memories that Aboriginal people have and what is still happening today are the sorts of things we have to ensure are finished forever&mdash;that they are conditions that we do not see into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all those tireless supporters and to our indigenous brothers and sisters: be secure in the knowledge that the Australian Democrats will not let you down. We will continue to work with the Indigenous Working Group and to support the amendments that they are putting before us. I ask all senators to find the courage to take a stand on this vitally important matter&mdash;not just on behalf of Aboriginal Australians but on behalf of the future of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to briefly mention the Wik people, whose name has become synonymous with this legislation. In 1605 the Dutch crew of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Duyfhen</EMPHASIS> landed on the west coast of Cape York, only to be driven away at spear point by Wik warriors. Several other Dutch explorers who followed met with a similar fate. The experience was documented again by the English in an English journal of 1625.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik people defended their land against the Dutch; they defended their land against those early British  explorers. But they could not, however, defeat the British military who, as a result of colonisation and based upon the presumption of terra nullius, drove them from their lands. Mabo, and now the Wik decision, have given them access again to some of their lands, but now we and others in this chamber have to help them and Aboriginal people across this country defend that regained access to their land against this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following principles were found by the majority of the High Court justices in the Wik case: one, that the granting of a pastoral lease does not necessarily extinguish all native title rights; two, that native title rights could continue at the same time as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9751"> the land was subject to a pastoral lease; and, three, that where there is a conflict in the exercise of those rights, native title rights are subordinate to those of the pastoral leaseholder. I ask this Senate and I ask all Australians: what is wrong with that? What is unfair in the Wik decision? To me, they seem perfectly fair and reasonable principles on which to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing revolutionary in the High Court judgment in Wik. In essence, what the court found is that, where there is a conflict between the native title rights of Aboriginal people and those property rights of the pastoral leaseholder, those of the pastoral leaseholder will take precedence and Aboriginal native title rights will be subordinated. That is what all the fuss is about. That is what the country is in uproar about&mdash;that Aboriginal people should be allowed the right to pursue native title rights where they do not interfere with the rights of the pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It seems to me that, if anyone came to Australia with no knowledge of our history and with no knowledge of the development of this issue, they would think that it was the Aboriginal people who should be upset and protesting that High Court decision, because it is their rights that have been found to be secondary. It is their rights that have been found to be only applicable where they do not interfere in any way with the rights of the leaseholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An outsider might say, `But don't these people own the land? Haven't they have been here for thousands of years? Isn't it their land? Why would a lease granted to a settler to run cattle take precedence over their thousands of years ownership of the land?' I think they are good questions that we in this parliament ought to turn our minds to as we debate the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . We should not fall into the framework provided by the government's response to the Wik decision. The bill is not about implementing Wik; it is about overturning the Wik decision and going even further in removing what little right to the land Aboriginal people can enjoy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When the decision was handed down, there was outrage among pastoralists, miners and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conservatives in this country. They demanded that the rights of Aboriginal people found to exist in Wik, as in Mabo, be extinguished. They claimed that their rights must be extinguished in the name of certainty. But what about fairness, what about justice and what about certainty for Aboriginal people? These are concepts that are not given any attention. Those people upset by the Wik decision reject coexistence. They say that they cannot accept coexistence and that they must have certainty by extinguishing the rights of Aboriginal people&mdash;what little of those rights that remain. I say: that is not acceptable; that is not a position that the Australian people can or should adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not about workability, as the government claims, and is not about a fair and equal response to Wik. It is largely about extinguishing rights of Aboriginal people to native title, limiting those rights and removing what influence Aboriginal people have over the use of the land to which they have claims. We see the government expressing concern to protect the property rights of white Australians, but they have no concern for the property rights of Aboriginal people. If what they want is certainty by dispossession, then they will do it without my vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a bizarre response. The government is very sensitive about those who claim it is a racist response. While I do not want to get into name-calling, the response is cynical, low&hyphen;road politics and is certainly not in the long-term interests of Australia. From my point of view, I celebrated when I heard the Wik decision. I thought, `That's great. That is a decision with which Australia can go forward, with which we can build reconciliation and with which we can build a better Australia,' because it was based on mutual rights. The decision recognised the rights of Aboriginal people and recognised the rights of pastoralists and miners, but said that the rights can coexist&mdash;that they can live together and work together to make this a better country and to respect each other's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that here was a tremendous challenge for the country, a tremendous opportunity, and I thought that the Liberal Party would do better than they have done. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9752"> Members of the Liberal Party always come in here saying that they oppose handouts to Aboriginal people and that they oppose the charity mentality which they say has grown up around Aboriginal people. But when Aboriginal people have their rights recognised, the first thing the Liberals do is to rush into this place to try to get those rights removed, to try to abolish those rights. How can people get away from a welfare mentality when you will not recognise rights that have been found by the High Court to exist and which I think any fair person would have said have existed since colonisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party are failing the challenge put down by the Wik decision. The Prime Minister, John Howard, has failed the challenge miserably, and I think his failure to provide leadership on this issue has really diminished him and diminished the country. We ought to demand better leadership from this parliament. This is not a question about whether you are pro-Aboriginal, pro&hyphen;miner or pro&hyphen;pastoralist&mdash;or anti any of those groups&mdash;it is about declaring, `You can be pro&hyphen;miner, pro&hyphen;pastoralist and pro-Aboriginal at the same time,' because we all have to live here. We all have to try to get on and develop this country in the interests of us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to remove Aboriginal rights that have been recognised in the Mabo and Wik decisions which overturned 200 years of neglect of those rights. But one thing is certain: there will be no certainty if this bill is passed. This legislation will not deliver the certainty that the government claims. The only thing that will give certainty and a way forward for Australia is to make coexistence work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The momentum is building in Australia for the development of goodwill towards Aboriginal people and co&hyphen;existence. I have been very heartened by the activities of the Women for Wik, the Australians for Native Title, the churches and all the people who have written to me and taken an interest and said, `I do not have any personal or economic interest in this but it is the right thing to do for the country. We ought to protect and recognise Aboriginal native title rights.' It has certainly helped firm me in my resolve; it has helped firm the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party in its resolve. The cheap politics that the Liberal Party sought to appeal to is not working in this country. People are looking, listening and analysing. They are saying, `This is not the way forward.' I am sorry, Senator Hill, it is not the way forward. I know you are better than that but some of your colleagues who now seem to control the Liberal Party are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say we should reject the fear. In the last two days the government has pulled a stunt by seeking to resurrect Richard Court's famous backyard threat claims. I thought we had grown out of that. Even Richard Court has grown up from there; even he has given that away. He has not threatened my suburban backyard in Perth for weeks. But what does this government, under pressure, struggling, losing the political debate go for? They pull it out of the bottom drawer: look out for your backyards because here come the Aboriginal people. What nonsense. What a disgrace. This government stands condemned for that because they have done nothing to add to the debate. They say, `Let's have a rational debate; let's have a debate without emotion. Don't call us racist; don't accuse us of doing the wrong thing. But, by the way, they're coming to get your backyard.' It is just not good enough. That is not the way to take the nation forward; that is not leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need to amend the existing bill. I had the privilege of chairing the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title in the time of the previous government and I have served on it since it was formed following the passage of the Native Title Act. I recognise that there is a need to amend the bill. The Brandy decision and the Waanyi decision regarding registration of claims provide real problems that need to be addressed in practical ways. But they do not go to the question of the balance of rights established in the Native Title Act; they go to practical operational problems about making that act work. No case has been made out to upset the balance of rights between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people with other interests in land established in the Native Title Act in 1993.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9753">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key thing I want to mention about that act is that it was established with Aboriginal consent. They were consulted; they were involved. Not all were happy, but there was a firm basis of Aboriginal consent in the establishment of that act. That is missing here. There is no Aboriginal consent to the Liberal government's bill. There has been very little in the way of real consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard claims that the pendulum has swung too far towards the Aboriginal people. That just proves that he has not been to an Aboriginal community since he was elected Prime Minister. Anybody who goes to outback Western Australia cannot accept that sort of argument. There is no case to be made that rights have been pushed too far in favour of Aboriginal people. In this debate we must not confuse the need to fix the very real practical problems that exist within the act&mdash;although I would argue that they are overstated on many occasions&mdash;with attempts to diminish Aboriginal rights. They are not the same thing. There are those who use the cloak of workability, certainty and problems with the act to argue what is an attempt to diminish Aboriginal rights. We should be clear about which amendments and which proposals by the government reflect which element of the criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most glaring concerns the right to negotiate. The Liberal Party make great play of encouraging negotiation and negotiated agreements and settlements. But what they do not tell you is that, at the same time, they reduce or take away the right to negotiate&mdash;the very right that gives Aboriginal people leverage and makes miners and pastoralists talk to them. The Liberal Party say, `We are in favour of negotiated agreements,' but it is a negotiated agreement between a person with power and a person who, under this bill, will have their power removed. That is something that must be understood by people coming to this debate: negotiated agreements are fine, they are to be encouraged, they are the way forward but they are only the way forward if they are negotiated by people with power and rights. Without those rights negotiated agreements will mean nothing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there are some real problems with the current act. The registration test is clearly one of them and Labor will be supporting improvements in that area. The question of multiple claims, particularly in the Kalgoorlie region of my home state, is a very real issue. Unfortunately a practice has grown up there where mining companies have been prepared to pay Aboriginal claimants money in order, basically, to make them go away. This has encouraged lodgment of overlapping claims by individuals and small family groups. You cannot hide that that is a problem that needs to be fixed. The Labor Party will be supporting a fix for that problem. But that is, as I have said, an approach to fix the real practical problem and not a basis to diminish Aboriginal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other fairly unpopular point I want to make is that the current act is not the real problem; that it is not the issue at stake. If you look at international experience and the development of native title since the act was passed in 1993, you will see that we have only just begun. European Australians tend to take a one&hyphen; or two&hyphen;year view of this. We need to apply some of the Aboriginal perspective. The development of native title in this country will take 50, 60, 70 or 100 years. There is no quick fix. The development of law and experience in this area will take time and the legal challenges will need to be worked through. Whatever legislation we pass here in the next couple of weeks will not change that. That development will have to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a delicious irony that the one state where there is now not as much of a difficulty in dealing with validation of past acts is my own state of Western Australia where, after their failure to win their challenge to the High Court, they actually followed the provisions of the Native Title Act in terms of future act regime. So we do not need to look at the question of validation in Western Australia to nearly the same extent because Western Australia was one of the few places that, after losing their High Court challenge, applied the act. Other state governments ignored it. They said, `We are not going to apply the Native Title Act; we'll just go on and hope like hell that it does not come back to bite us.' Well, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9754"> it has and now they are screaming and saying that we have to fix it for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people are saying to us, `Well, why should you fix it? We knew what the law was and they knew what the law was.' That obviously is going to be one of the key debates and one of the most difficult debates for this parliament, because state governments did not seek to apply the Native Title Act, they did not use their good offices to make it work. They did not provide goodwill in making the legislation workable, and they are in large part responsible for the problems that have arisen in relation to the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Liberal Party have to be very careful here because they have established a range of false hopes in the community. They have promised people that there are quick and easy solutions, that certainty will be delivered. My own state Premier, Richard Court, did that. He went down that path immediately after the Mabo decision, and I think he learnt the lesson that the courts, international pressure and the Australian community will not allow Aboriginal people to be deprived of their rights merely by the passage of a bill in this parliament. If there is no agreement generally in the Australian community, especially if there is no agreement with Aboriginal people, there will not be certainty. Those who hold out to people the promise of certainty and a positive outcome without that agreement are misleading them and are giving them false hope, because in my view it will not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation is not the answer here. The answer is a broad agreement within the Australian community about coexistence and about a willingness to live and work together and to recognise each other's rights. No act of parliament can provide that but an act of parliament can prevent its happening. Negotiation among the parties is the key. They must sit down and talk together; they must work it through. We can provide the framework. We can improve the legislation to assist them, but at the end of the day miners must sit down with Aboriginal people, pastoralists must sit down with Aboriginal people, and they must work through their problems and they must reach agreement. That is the only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way that what people see as the problems with native title will be solved. It is in the hands of the parties, and this parliament will not give them the quick fix they seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that Aboriginal people do not expect justice from this parliament but they also do not see this debate as the end of the war. This is one battle or one skirmish in their drive to have their legitimate rights to land in this country recognised. If we think that by passing a bill in the next couple of weeks they will go away, we are grossly mistaken. They will not go away, the justice of their struggle will not dissipate and their resolve will not dissipate. They will achieve justice whatever this parliament does. I think we ought to reflect on that when we reflect on what we do in terms of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the pleasure of being involved with leading Aboriginal people like Patrick Dodson, Peter Yu and Lois O'Donoghue. They are providing enormously strong leadership to their people. There are thousands of other young Aboriginal people in the community providing leadership, leading the charge to ensure that their rights are recognised, and they will not be defeated by passage of a bill in this place. We ought not underestimate them; we ought communicate with them, bring them into the process and recognise their legitimate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an obligation to understand their perspective. There are a lot of pastoralists and people with mining backgrounds in this parliament. As we have reflected, it is sad that there are no Aboriginal persons at this stage. We have to try to understand the perspective of all parties: the miners, the pastoralists and the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people will not walk away from the recognition of their rights that they received in the Mabo and Wik decisions. Whatever we think we can do, they will not give up that struggle. We ought to understand their perspective, we ought to give voice to their concerns and we ought to bring them into the debate. One of the great disappointments of this particular debate is that the government has failed to enter meaningful negotiations with those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9755">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament will be put to the test: will we legislate away those rights so recently recognised in the courts for Aboriginal people? Well, not me; I am not in it. This seems to me a most fundamental issue. I will not be in the removal of those rights. I do not have a black&hyphen;armband view of history, but I do take responsibility for my own actions here and I will not be in it. Let us celebrate the Wik decision. Let us confirm the rights of all parties. Let us fix the practical difficulties within the current act but reject the call to downgrade or abolish Aboriginal rights. Let us embrace coexistence and make it work for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments on this very important piece of legislation. I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Evans. There were a number of points with which I would agree and my side would agree: his call for coexistence, his reflection on the need for peoples to live and work together and his call for a respect for each other's rights. I regret, however, that he chose to misrepresent the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in order to further his political interests. I also regret that he clearly misunderstood the bill that is before the parliament. I prefer to say that he misunderstood it rather than misrepresented it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this bill is part of a broader national debate on how best to achieve social and economic justice and equality for indigenous people. Twenty&hyphen;one per cent of indigenous Australians are either homeless or living in overcrowded conditions. Twenty per cent of indigenous families still do not have basic amenities such as toilets, bathrooms and running water. Thirty&hyphen;three per cent of indigenous students complete secondary education compared with 76 per cent of other Australians. Fourteen per cent of the prison population are indigenous Australians, from only 1.6 per cent of the population. These are important issues for which we are still searching for an adequate response. There is no doubt, however, that they fairly call for special support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year the parliament celebrated the 30th anniversary of the referendum which granted the Commonwealth legislative power to make laws with respect to Aborigines. I said at that time that over those following 30 years many attempts had been made to address disadvantage and injustice. Various reforms such as dedicated health and legal services for Aboriginal people, community employment development programs, housing infrastructure, national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy and the establishment of ATSIC have all been steps upon the path towards more genuine equality. But we still have a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do better understand the pain and suffering of forced separation of families, resulting from practices of the past which might have been well intentioned but which devastated social and cultural structures. We must, as far as is humanly possible, redress that wrong. There is now a greater appreciation of the relationship between Aborigines and the land and the sophisticated and complex social, cultural, religious and land tenure systems, so that we better understand how loss of land and loss of identity with land has devastated indigenous self-confidence. Return of land has been, and still is, critical to achieving social justice and rebuilding that self-confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, we recollect with pride the decision of the Fraser government in 1976 to grant land rights to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory; and we support the indigenous land fund, established by the previous government and continued by this government, which provides nearly $1.4 billion for indigenous Australians to purchase land. But more important than both was the decision of the High Court in Mabo, because it was a recognition by our common law that native title had, in fact, always existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no misunderstanding: this government accepts and respects the existence of native title, as enunciated in the Mabo decision of the High Court. We support the right of indigenous Australians to protection of that right of title. The outdated doctrine of terra nullius, a land belonging to no-one, has no place in contemporary Australia. Mabo, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9756"> however, called for a legislative response to protect and respect native title rights, while providing sufficient certainty to enable economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, in that circumstance, Labor made a mess of it. What we warned at the time was that the legislation was deficient without a cooperative federal response. We warned that there was a distinct possibility that native title was not extinguished by pastoral leases. And we warned that, because of the uncertainty created by the Mabo decision, if inadequately then legislated, it contained the ingredients for a significant backlash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These warnings went unheeded by an arrogant administration and a Prime Minister who had long previously given up listening. It has now been left to the coalition government not only to make the Native Title Act 1993 workable but also to provide a practical commonsense response to the issues which have emerged from the Wik decision of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the High Court in Wik found that the rights conferred on the grantees of pastoral leases concerned did not necessarily extinguish native title in the areas subject to those leases. The decision raised doubts about the validity not only of previous acts done over pastoral and leasehold land but also of future activities. In essence, it found that Labor was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the coalition has had no alternative but to legislatively respond to this and the many other deficiencies that have been found in the currently existing legislation. To my knowledge, no&hyphen;one has argued that the current native title is not deficient&mdash;not even Senator Evans who preceded me. There have been over 677 claims, with only one determination of native title in four years. It has not served indigenous or non-indigenous interests well. It does not even give legal certainty to voluntary agreements about native title. As a result, there has been an ongoing anxiety on the indigenous side and also for those representing mining and rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned previously, the Wik judgment rendered false what the previous government claimed: that valid grants of pastoral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leases extinguished native title. The Native Title Amendment Bill is a genuine attempt, in very complex and extremely difficult circumstances, to reduce uncertainty, protect native title rights, and develop a more effective framework for land management in Australia. Our firm objective from the beginning has been to arrive at a solution based on racial equality and basic fairness and justice, which also promotes Australia's national interest, which obviously includes economic interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have consulted widely and in good faith. We have endeavoured to accommodate the interests of all stakeholders. And, in my opinion, the Prime Minister deserves particular credit for the personal efforts he has put in in those negotiations. Obviously, it is not an easy task. But, at the end of the day, we believe that this bill is a fair compromise between the competing interests and, specifically, against a background of Labor's legislation being falsely premised and, as such, having misled many ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This task has been made more difficult by some on both sides of the debate who have resorted to extreme and unwarranted assertions to make their case. Invective and smears are no substitute for reasoned argument and balanced debate. This legislation should not be a source of division or a forum for the politics of hatred, nor should it be used for base political motives. Then there are those with significant influence who contribute from a less than well informed position. They are well meaning, and I respect their right to make social comment. But, in socially sensitive areas, it is important to have regard to the facts&mdash;and neither one side nor the other might assert what are to be the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives effect to the Wik decision but integrates it into Australia's land management laws and systems. We are therefore putting in place what the former Labor government was professing to do in 1993 but which was then so badly mishandled. In debating this difficult issue, it is a time for tolerance, understanding and social cohesion. We have sought to find a just and practical response to these issues. I suggest it is time for the committee debate to be called on, for the detail of the bill to be debated, with less 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9757"> name calling, less point scoring and less extremism. I commend the bill to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight because of press reports over the last week that there are currently outbreaks of whooping cough and measles in Australia. I believe there is an urgency to assist parents to get their children immunised, and this cannot be emphasised enough. The reason that I do so was that last week in the Senate the Australian Vaccination Network circulated a false and mischievous document which has influenced people against immunisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators that have any doubts about the efficacy of immunisation are asked to review the virtual elimination of Haemophlus Influenzae disease in immunised children since the introduction of widespread Hib immunisation. This immunisation has prevented dozens of children from suffering lifelong neurological disability. The Australian Vaccination Network believes that factors other than immunisation are responsible for the fall in immunisation preventable diseases in the Australian community. However, during the time that the Hib immunisation has been available, community health standards have effectively been constant. The only change has been the introduction of the immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other observable fact is that, as the overall immunisation rate has fallen, there has been an increase in the number of immunisation preventable diseases. I refer specifically to some of the claims made in their leaflet. They state that vaccines contain many toxic ingredients, including formaldehyde. It is an exaggeration and is misleading to say that vaccines contain many toxic ingredients. Small amounts of additives are used in vaccines. For example, formaldehyde is used to detoxify the tetanus toxin produced in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> manufacture of tetanus vaccine. The vaccine is then purified to remove any excess formaldehyde. The residual formaldehyde is in very low concentration, far lower than the maximum allowed by the standard specified in the British Pharmacopoeia, which is the standard adopted by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another statement that `over the past century, death rates from childhood diseases had dropped an estimated 90 per cent before the introduction of vaccines or antibiotics'. The death rate from infectious diseases dropped with improved sanitation and hygiene. However, these diseases are still highly infectious, and deaths and serious consequences still occur. Our children can only be protected by being vaccinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the program of vaccination against Hib is testimony for the need for a vaccination program in modern Australia. This vaccine was introduced to the standard childhood schedule in 1993, and since that time we have witnessed a 94 per cent reduction in the number of Hib disease in children under five years of age. There was another extraordinary claim that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vaccines are cultured on animal tissue and therefore contain many bacteria and viruses other than the ones they are supposed to immunise against. For instance, the polio vaccines was (sic) contaminated with 40 known monkey viruses&mdash;one of which, SV&hyphen;40, is thought to cause cancer and has also been linked with the development of AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Only viral vaccines are cultured in material derived from animal tissues. Bacterial vaccines are manufactured in cultures free of animal cells. Careful screening and testing ensure that the resulting vaccines are free from known contaminants, including bacteria and viruses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SV40 virus contaminated some batches of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963, but there has been no evidence of increased risk of mortality, especially cancer mortality, in persons who have received this vaccine. Since 1963 all polio vaccines have been demonstrated to be free of SV40 as well as other known possible contaminants. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever linking AIDS to polio vaccines. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another statement was that the rubella and chicken pox vaccines are cultured on cell lines of aborted foetuses. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall Senator Harradine's concern about this statement. The truth is that rubella and varicella&mdash;chicken pox&mdash;viruses vaccine is grown on cell lines which originated in one aborted foetus over 30 years ago&mdash;in fact, in 1961. No foetal tissue has been used recently in the testing or the production of these vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another statement made was that vaccines do not guarantee protection from disease. That is true to an extent&mdash;just as no medical intervention guarantees 100 per cent success&mdash;but it does guarantee 95 per cent success. Vaccination is a highly effective method of providing protection against certain diseases to both children and adults. Despite that less than 100 per cent effectiveness, vaccination programs have ensured that smallpox has been eradicated from the world solely due to vaccination, and poliomyelitis is expected to be eradicated within a few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another extraordinary statement was that the US government has paid out in excess of $US800 million since 1986 for vaccine damage. When we checked, there was no data available to verify the amount quoted. In fact, in Australia there has been only one known case where that has been pursued in the last 15 years. The fact that compensation has been paid does not prove that vaccines have been the cause of problems experienced. In the United States there is in place a vaccine compensation scheme which allows easy access to parents who believe that their child experienced a significant vaccine adverse reaction, and Australia does not have a similar vaccine compensation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another statement says that in a study conducted by Dr Michael Odent&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS>, July 1994&mdash;asthma was shown to be five times more common in children who had been vaccinated against whooping cough. It also said that two follow&hyphen;up studies since that time have confirmed these results. When we checked, we found that Dr Odent made this claim in a brief letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet </EMPHASIS>in 1994. There was no peer review of his publication and no scrutiny of his claim was possible. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There appears to be no evidence whatsoever of the alleged follow&hyphen;up studies, for which no reference has been given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on. The whole document cannot be verified. It concerns me very much because there is a certain amount of truth in some of the statements, but the vast majority of these statements are completely false and cannot be justified. I am doubly concerned because I see that a recently published booklet is now on the bookstands. It was in the hands of one of my parliamentary colleagues the other day. The poor chap believed that some of the material in that was also verifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that Australian parents recognise the validity of the necessity for immunisation. The rate of immunisation in this country has fallen to the lowest level since it was introduced. We are now witnessing epidemics of a major nature, deaths and neurological damage in our children because of the laxity of parents. We have introduced a stimulus for immunisation in the  Child Care Payments Bill 1997 , whereby parents need to give some evidence that a child is immunised before it is admitted to child care. The reason for that is that, with a high level of lack of immunisation, those children are at risk of infection. The corollary is that, if there is a high level of immunisation, there will be protection for those children who are not immunised. It has been estimated that fewer than two per cent, fortunately, of Australian patients have any sort of conscientious objection to immunisation. Their children would be protected if the other 98 per cent were immunised because the disease would be highly unlikely to spread within a child&hyphen;care centre.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9758"><TITLE>Cyber Democracy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about an issue that is quite close to my heart. I would like to begin by saying that November 1997 should be recorded as a significant month for the progression of Australia towards a phenomenon that I have called cyber democracy. Cyber democracy is about creating  opportunities for political participation by citizens on&hyphen;line. In November this year the Australian federal parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9759"> initiated an upgrade of information services that has given every elected representative the opportunity to establish an e-mail account and to have Internet access via the Parliament House offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this event should not be lost. Another avenue for communication has been established with parliamentarians. This can only make us more accessible and therefore more accountable. From my point of view, I hope that this opportunity will be used by all members and senators. I have found that e-mail has been an incredibly useful means by which I can canvass people's views and receive representations from a huge number of people as well as maintain effective contacts with my colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that this initiative will also inspire parliamentarians to take an active approach to establishing an effective web page. All major political parties have already done so. I am proud to say that the Labor Party's home page is certainly recognised as leading the way in this regard, not only in providing practical information about the policies of our party but also the appropriate connections and linkages that make it serve as a useful site, whether it be for  research purposes or just general interest of the public to find out a little more about what the Labor Party stands for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individual home pages take the issue a step further. They provide the opportunity for individuals to interact with their elected representative on a one-to-one basis. The opportunity exists to establish a series of feedback forms or, in fact, to sign an electronic petition. During the current debate on the amendments to the Native Title Act, I have found that hundreds of people have chosen to utilise this avenue to contact many of us in this place about their views. This is an entirely appropriate and effective way of letting us know what is in their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This initiative is a wonderful thing but it is not without some challenges. Electronic mail has the same status as traditional correspondence. The challenge for us to document, accord and act upon what we receive in this form is something that I am sure many are tackling at the moment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other big challenge with all of this is that it is great for us to be on-line&mdash;it is terrific for parliamentarians to have this facility&mdash;but it is only a truly effective means of communication if everybody has the opportunity to access the Internet and utilise this means of communication with their elected representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the issue is one of access and equity of access to new technologies such as the Internet. We know statistically that access to the Internet is still quite limited. Although Australia has one of the most impressive statistics on the take&hyphen;up of new technologies, the fact remains that the home ownership of an Internet&hyphen;connected PC relates very closely to your socioeconomic status. The more money you earn, the more likely you are to have a modem&hyphen;connected computer in your home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue about access to new technologies such as the Internet relates to the opportunity that you may have either in education or in the workplace. You should appreciate that if you are in the services sector you are more likely to be able to utilise the facilities through your workplace than you are if you work in the construction industry. You should appreciate that if you attend a university there is pretty well a 100 per cent chance that you will embark upon some course or study that will bring you into direct contact with the Internet and it will become part of the way you conduct your study and research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were denied these opportunities and you do not break that barrier on the socioeconomic scale, the chances are that you are not even going to get a look in. This is why initiatives to improve access to the Internet are so critical. I noted with interest the other day the various announcements by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) about access to the Internet, be it rural and remote communities access, be it access via the education system or be it access via the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to offer my comments with respect to these initiatives. By and large, it is a positive step. There are a proliferation of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9760"> reports about how imperative it is to improve this level of access. But it is also worth noting that there were a number of projects in place prior to this government being elected that were abandoned on election, and they have only recently been revisited through the initiatives that we have heard of just this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those initiatives was in fact a rural on&hyphen;line initiative. It was through the department of regional development under the Labor government's regional economic development organisation strategy. This particular project piloted, for the first time, local call access to the Internet in rural communities. It did so by establishing a hub in Bega. The project was known as the Bega telecottage and I am happy to say that this initiative survived, despite the abandonment of that particular overarching regional initiative by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other significant opportunity that was lost when this government was elected, and that I think has actually set Australia back by a large degree, was the proposed Gungahlin project. This project was a Telstra initiative with some direct Commonwealth government funding support. It proposed to take broadband services directly to a thousand houses for the purposes of laying a testbed for high bandwidth Internet and other applications related services into homes. Why was this important? Because it allowed Australia to stay at the forefront of what is a content&hyphen;driven on&hyphen;line initiative. That project was abandoned because Telstra had to tighten their books in the lead&hyphen;up to privatisation&mdash;another opportunity lost. We have not seen a project of that nature re&hyphen;emerge. We do not have the public utility available now to pursue it. We are in a situation where the government has lost effectively 18 months worth of time to establish itself in this area. Whilst I commend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9761"> recent initiatives to act on rural access to the Internet and other ideas that have been very well articulated in reports delivered to this parliament some time ago, many opportunities have been lost and Australia will suffer for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point of this contribution this evening was to highlight the fact that it is of great progression in getting parliamentarians on line, but the equation is not complete until every Australian has the opportunity to access these services also.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.42 p.m." PAGE="9761"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.42 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
