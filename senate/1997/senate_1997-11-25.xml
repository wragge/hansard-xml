<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware that 58 per cent of respondents to the New South Wales social services hotline, conducted on 28 October, said that there had been a drop in quality at their local child&hyphen;care centre? Does the minister agree that the accreditation system, which was introduced to guarantee quality, is becoming ineffective because of cost&hyphen;saving measures brought about by $820 million that have been cut out of child care in the last two years by this government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for the question. I have been around long enough in this game to question any survey&mdash;any phone polling&mdash;that is done. The survey that Senator Neal refers to is one organised by the New South Wales government. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that it was a half&hyphen;day phone&hyphen;in, asking anybody that had got a problem `to ring on in and let us know what your beef is'&mdash;a great survey, very dispassionate and aimed at getting the truth! Four hundred people rang in to the survey. I worked out that, as there are 395,000 people that access child care in Australia, and get the rebate, that is 0.001 per cent of the sample.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So 0.001 per cent of the sample rang in, Senator O'Brien. They rang in to voice their complaints. Four hundred people rang in to the survey. So here we go again with another scaremongering attitude towards this. The approach was obviously fundamentally flawed. Any hotline set up for `parents with problems' to `ring in and talk to us' of course is going to attract callers who have got particular concerns. We did not hear, for example, from the large proportion of families who remain satisfied with their child&hyphen;care arrangements and understand the need to target scarce resources to those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fee increases claimed by the New South Wales Council of Social Service of between $15 and $40 per week per child are grossly overstated. National data indicates that community sector fee increases average around $14 per week compared with a one dollar per week increase for the 70 per cent of families using the private centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the quality of care, which was the second part of Senator Neal's question, the regulatory framework of state and territory children's services regulations are a state and territory responsibility. If 400 people rang in complaining about the New South Wales government, good on them, because the New South Wales government is responsible for the regulation of that quality care. I applaud them for ringing in to their own government to let it know that they were getting such poor quality care from their own state regulatory authority.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth quality improvement and accreditation system for long day care centres is in place and a review is to be undertaken as a priority by the new Child Care Advisory Council, and that will be announced shortly.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9338"> tions. I repeat again: they are state and territory regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs, of course, the informed involvement of parents, and one would expect that that should be so and that is to be applauded. Commonwealth initiatives, such as the child&hyphen;care access hotline and the quality improvement and accreditation system, are helping to raise parents' awareness of good quality child care so that they can make more informed choices. Centres are also encouraged to work in partnership with parents. That is what our policy is about&mdash;choices, choice by the parents, unlike the previous government's where that was not available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Despite your views, Minister, there is a great deal of concern in the community about what is happening with child care. Are the budget cuts to child care made by this government determined by budgetary constraints or are they determined by the view of the Lyons Forum of what the role of women should be?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The dear old Lyons Forum is accorded much more strength and power than actually exists within it. I am a proud member of the Lyons Forum and I wish we could influence the budget, as Senator Neal suggests. The Lyons Forum is concerned about families. It is concerned about mothers, fathers and children&mdash;and long may it be so that it is concerned, because that is what this government is concerned about: the quality of child care and that child care should be available to working mothers so that it improves the quality of their home life and the quality of both parents' lives. So we get the dear old Lyons Forum dragged into it again. As I say, it would be wonderful if it had such influence but, regrettably, it does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An allegation is made that we have made cuts in child care. In fact, child care under our policy is designed to improve choices for parents, both fathers and mothers, increasing expenditure and giving greater choice.</PARA>

Retail sales are booming, business investment is strong, consumer confidence is up and unemployment is reducing. This is what the Howard government has delivered in just 20 months, through sensible, sound economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the Senate of further good news. I am sure all senators will be pleased that we have now had a 55 per cent decrease in industrial disputes over the year to August, a 2.5 per cent rise in DEETYA's skilled vacancy survey in November&mdash;which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9339"> is a 15 per cent rise since June&mdash;and a 9.1 per cent increase in company profits for the year to September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to the responsible economic management of the Howard government we are in good shape to withstand the turbulence within the region. As the Reserve Bank Governor said recently, we are in a much better position to handle the financial instability in Asia than we have been at any stage in the last quarter of a century. For that, the Australian people can be grateful to the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would have been the alternative? What is the comparison? Have Labor learnt from their mistakes of the past, which led to the huge budget deficit of $10 billion inherited by this government? Unfortunately, it seems not. Mr Evans, former Senator Evans, the shadow Treasurer, said the other day, `There are all sorts of elements of continuity between the kind of government we were for the last 13 years and the kind of government we would be for the future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`How,' he was asked, `are you going to meet these big spending commitments?' He said, `Overwhelmingly, we are relying on growth momentum to generate the additional revenue.' Just the way of the past. No consideration of expenditure restraint. You rely on growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember what former Treasurer Dawkins said on 9 March 1993. He said, `We have a deficit reduction plan. As the economy grows, the budget will repair itself.' Mr Keating, the then Prime Minister, had the same line. He said, `In time, the deficit just fixes itself. As the economy picks up, the revenue picks up and the deficit falls.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This opposition&mdash;this Labor Party&mdash;has not learnt from the mistakes of the past. Mr Evans is saying it again and again. He conceded, `Over the course of the election cycle, of course we may need to have deficit years.' The same story: do not worry about expenditure, just keep pump&hyphen;priming the budget, and somehow or other it solves itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians now know that does not work. This Labor government left Australia precariously poised at the time of the last election, with a $10 billion deficit. One can only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wonder what would have been the consequences had a prudent, sensible Howard government not taken the economic decisions that it did to rein in expenditure. They were difficult decisions. They were politically difficult decisions. But they were decisions which were in the best interests of the nation and which can enable us to withstand the turbulence occurring elsewhere within this region. For that all Australians should be pleased. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9340"> and Family Services. Was it the intention of the government to force women to reduce their working hours or to leave the work force entirely when it cut $820 million from the child&hyphen;care budget or did the government simply not understand the effect an increase in child&hyphen;care costs of between $15 and $40 a week would have on an average family's budget?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal keeps putting up these Aunt Sallys and now I have to knock them down because, in fact, there has been an increase in spending on child care. Senator Schacht, you might be interested to know that an estimated $4.9 billion has been allocated to child care over the next four years. It is up from $1.1 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 to $1.3 billion in 2000&hyphen;01. So tell me about these cuts. Where are they?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are making them up. Thank you, Senator Parer. I am sure that Councillor June O'Connell, who is the leader of the Liberal Party in the Queensland City Council, is interested in this. Councillor O'Connell is very interested in child care because it affects the Brisbane City Council as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that Senator Neal has not cottoned on to the fact that there is more money being spent. Prior to the 1996 budget, real growth in the programs outlays was projected at nine per cent per annum and it is now projected at three per cent per annum. So the actual amount of money is being increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal also asked me: what is the government doing about this? As I said to Senator Neal previously, it is about greater choice and it is about improved targeting of assistance to families most in need of assistance. We are introducing a system of safety nets for families requiring additional support, such as those with children at risk of abuse or neglect, families with a child with a disability and families in rural and remote areas. We are also introducing a planning system to ensure that families have improved access to care and that government subsidies are sustainable and targeted to areas of highest need. Also, we have introduced a commitment to build on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the system of quality improvement by extending it to other sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point that Senator Neal made was an allegation that there was a change in female participation in the labour force; that we were forcing people out of the labour force. What are the facts? Firstly, I want to make the point that decisions to increase fees are made by service providers, not by the government. Fee structures in child care are influenced by several factors, such as movements in award wages, charging practices, changes to regulations or increases in overheads such as rates, insurance, utilities, et cetera. The Labor Party would not understand that because none of them have been in private enterprise&mdash;not one. So they would not understand about rates, insurance and utilities. Secondly, the Bureau of Statistics labour force figures show that the total participation rate of females with dependent children under 15 years of age has remained relatively stable at around 59 per cent since January 1996. Thirdly, preliminary 1997 child&hyphen;care census data show that the average weekly full&hyphen;time fee for children attending long day care centres is now around $160. This is only slightly above the trend over the last six years. Increases around that variety have all been between $6 and $10 per year for families using full&hyphen;time care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims that the government's child care measures have forced women out of the work force have no basis in fact when a reasonable analysis of the data is undertaken. The government is concerned that fees continue to rise, as they have done since 1991. The new child care council will examine charging practices as a key priority over the next year.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. In fact, Minister, your budget cuts to child care mean less choices for families.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9341"> would be fairer if Senator Neal stuck to the truth and the facts, instead of closing her ears and closing her eyes to the fact that there are no cuts. The amount of money is increasing. We are giving greater choice to women. We are giving them the opportunity to decide what they should do with their time, as they are rightly entitled to do. Senator Neal, by coming in here with a scaremongering campaign, as you are doing by not sticking to the truth and by relating figures that are not factual, you achieve nothing. It is a reflection on your own inability to understand the facts. I think it reflects more on Senator Neal than it does on the government itself. The government is giving more choice to women because it gives them the opportunity for more choice and more money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very pleasant task to be able to announce that we are doing what Labor promised to do for years but, once again, never delivered on&mdash;to extend SBS into the regional areas of Western Australia. That is something that many people in those areas have been waiting very many years to receive. Those living in remote areas generally will receive a comprehensive suite of satellite broadcasting services, including SBS, Triple J and the Parliamentary News Network. In addition, they will be subsidised for the cost of upgrading their equipment to digital. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new range of services will be provided in conjunction with a digitising of satellite operations, which will also provide for Internet access and potentially allow access to an increasing range of new types of communication services in remote areas, including pay television. The dedicated SBS television service available in remote Western Australia via satellite will be available right across the board for the first time. Again, it will involve subsidised services to 3,500 direct to home satellite households and 120 remote Aboriginal and self&hyphen;help communities, in plenty of time for the 1998 World Cup. In total there will be $11.2 million of Commonwealth funding available to provide subsidies for the cost of upgrading. That will directly assist 12,000 direct to home remote households and there will be subsidies towards the replacement of each existing decoder in remote Aboriginal and self&hyphen;help communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is tremendously good news for people outside the capital cities, and particularly in Western Australia. Senator Crane, in particular, would appreciate this because, for the first time, these people will be able to get up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information on what is really happening in this place. They will not have to rely on all the snide scare campaigns and innuendo that might be peddled when they occasionally get a visit from a Labor senator up to the far north. They will be able to see it for themselves. They will be able to tune in to the ALP conference in Hobart and discover the sheer horror of it all&mdash;the fact that nothing has changed. And, just in case some people pretend that it has changed, they will be reminded that former Senator Evans said only last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be utterly implausible if we tried to present ourselves as a different kind of outfit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there it is: a plea of guilty from the highest level. These people will also be able to get access to Senator Schacht's website. They will be able to find out what the disgruntled unionist faction is up to, whether Senator Schacht is actually going to be allowed to go to Hobart and whether he will deliver on the goods that he promised last week after Robert Ray had spent weeks saying that there was a huge difference between platform and policy, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9342"> and that majority was fair enough. Senator Schacht ate humble pie last week and told us that they were not going to allow any single further sell down from 65 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these viewers in remote Western Australia and around the remote communities will be able to tune in and watch it ball by ball as Senator Schacht gets up there, does what the ACTU wants, tells Senator Ray to get lost, and delivers the goods. He is delivering the goods to us, I might say, because he is locking the Australian public out of any further access to a sell down in Telstra and denying the government the opportunity to use additional revenue to repay debt. In other words, he is locked into the tired, old, failed policies of the past which, as Senator Hill quite rightly demonstrated, delivered record unemployment and record high interest rates&mdash;all the records you would not want to tell your kids about but which will be available in technicolour sound to all those people in remote areas for the first time. They will be delighted to hear it because they will know that once again Labor failed them. Labor could not get the service there&mdash;maybe because it did not want the people to know what Labor was really up to.

Minister, yesterday in Vancouver the Prime Minister unilaterally offered to place on the table the ownership of all Australia's banks as a bargaining chip for an international treaty on financial services.

Given the Liberal Party's long-held concern that treaty obligations should not bind Australia without parliamentary scrutiny, can you, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, assure the Senate that the government will first seek to bring such a major change of policy before the parliament by way of appropriate amendments to the Banking Act before trading off the control of our banks in some smoke-filled room in Vancouver?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable senator has misunderstood the Prime Minister's contribution to this important liberalisation reform agenda. What the Prime Minister announced was Australia's new offer to encourage the finalisation of the WTO financial services negotiations by 12 December. The major change is to offer to remove the prohibition on the foreign acquisition of Australia's four major banks. However, foreign acquisitions would remain subject to the national interest test under Australia's foreign investment policy guidelines and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The improved offer is part of Australia's strategy to secure a successful conclusion to the WTO financial services negotiations. We wish to secure an agreement that provides market openings, particularly within the Asia-Pacific, for Australia's financial services exports. I would have thought the honourable senator, having an interest in these matters, would recognise the particular windows of opportunity that seem to be presenting themselves within the region at this time. The Prime Minister specifically is seeking an agreement that protects existing foreign investment, leads to the issuing of new banking and insurance licences and allows for majority control and raised equity participation levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's financial services sector is strongly placed to capture new market opportunities created by the WTO negotiations if the considerable barriers to financial services exports and investment were lowered or indeed removed. Australia's significantly improved offer is conditional. It depends upon our trading partners, including developed and developing APEC members, also committing

<ANSWER PAGE="9345" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for the question because it highlights a very real problem affecting rural, regional and remote areas of Australia. It was a legacy that we were left with after 13 years of Labor Party neglect. They had a chance to do something about it and they did nothing. They thought the solution was to flood the country with doctors. They did that in an attempt to break the profession. What did it do? It produced many extra doctors in this country. We have this extraordinary paradox, as Senator Harradine highlights, where we have an oversupply of 4,000 general practitioners nationally but a desperate shortage in country Australia, as it struggles to recruit and keep doctors. The oversupply has not led to an increase in the number of doctors in rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania shares the problem, as does the rest of the country: there are too many GPs in the capital but not enough in rural and regional areas. In fact, Launceston has one of the biggest shortfalls in the country, as was mentioned in the paper today. Figures from the Australian Work Force Advisory Committee in 1994 show that many more doctors are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needed in Launceston, but in other areas as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken this issue head on since we came into government. We have made significant commitments in the last two budgets to address the quality of general practice services and the medical work force crisis. We have committed over $150 million in new funding for rural health initiatives. Unlike the previous government, we actually went to the rural doctors and asked them what they needed and what we could do to encourage people to stay in rural and remote areas, because it is not just a case of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making sure that the right of the community to have access to medical care is not subsumed by the desire of doctors to work only in metropolitan areas. We cannot blame them for that&mdash;80 per cent of the population of Australia like living on the coastal strip, and we cannot deny the rights of doctors to have the same desire. But, by restricting access to Medicare to those doctors with specialist or general practice postgraduate training or those on a training program, the best opportunities to the remaining graduates are the jobs available in the country. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that these jobs will be facilitated through the career pathways in rural hospitals, rural clinical assistantships and rural locum positions. The reality is that it is very demanding work. You are expected to be a jack&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;trades and competent, and then there is the chance of being sued for any mishap that occurs on the same basis as if you were practising in the city with access to specialised care. It is a very important part of medical practice. The rural doctors need the training but they also need the support and the opportunity to undergo postgraduate training and therefore the opportunity to obtain locums so that they can come down from those rural areas to the regional areas to get further training to bring them up to the latest standards. They recognise that too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government is committed to improving rural specialist services, including obstetrics. You would be well aware, Madam President, of the litigation that occurs in relation to obstetrics, yet we expect that a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9346"> general practitioner in a rural or remote area is up with the latest technology, has the latest knowledge and the latest facilities and that, if a mishap occurs, they can cope with it. To that end, we have introduced a number of programs to increase the supply of specialist services in rural areas, including a  number which focus specifically on obstetric services in rural areas. They include projects funded under the additional specialist training post initiative in rural areas and the rural health support, education and training program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy. My question relates to the development of the oil and gas reserves Australia shares with Indonesia in the Timor Sea. Will the minister please outline actions taken by the coalition government to facilitate the development of these reserves? Has Australia benefited from recent discussions with Indonesia about these reserves?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9347" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Eggleston for that question. Two weeks ago I met with my counterpart, General Sudjana, in Cairns for the eighth ministerial council meeting under the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty. This treaty was ratified to establish a joint authority to govern the development of oil and gas reserves that Australia shares with Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators will probably remember that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Senator Gareth Evans, signed that treaty. But he did not do it in the normal way. He did it with a great flamboyant flourish that was quite typical of former Senator Evans. Of course, in the course of events he left a lot of things undone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great challenge confronting Minister Sudjana and me was the resolution of the basis for sharing of production benefits of oil and gas deposits in the zone of cooperation. Former Senator Evans just did not address what would occur if processing occurred 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9348"> outside the zone of cooperation, whether it be in Indonesian waters or in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not help but notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 October that Trevor Sykes drew attention to this matter and said it would have to be addressed by me and General Sudjana. He said that we would attempt to sort out the problem. He said, `This is a case of better late than never, because these problems started to emerge years ago and should have been determined then.' So what did the former government do? Yet again it buried its head in the sand and left the problem to the Howard government to fix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the Senate that Minister Sudjana and I struck an agreement on mutually acceptable principles of benefit sharing of the zone of cooperation between the two countries. These are issues which will need to be clarified and this will be achieved on the following agreed principles: firstly, the exploitation of the petroleum resources should proceed without delay; secondly, governments will work towards the objective of equal sharing between the contracting states, Australia and Indonesia, of the benefits of the exploitation of petroleum resources; thirdly, it will achieve optimum commercial utilisation of the exploitation of the petroleum resources, including the location and technology of any processing facilities; and, fourthly, governments will have regard to the development potential and the strengthening of a wider spectrum of future cooperation between the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These basic principles of fiscal benefit sharing will pave the way to the development of Bayu&hyphen;Undan. The Bayu&hyphen;Undan gas discovery is the largest potential development of the zone of cooperation, to date involving some anticipated $10 billion in expenditure. The field extends across two production sharing contracts. The development of this resource could involve the construction of an LNG processing plant at Darwin or Indonesia, or at an offshore location at sea. The environmental impacts of options for development are currently under review. The benefits of the development of similar such resources are huge, with flow-on work to small business and significant employment opportunities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This resolution is testament to the cooperative and productive spirit of both countries and represents a significant step forward for the region's petroleum industry. Once again the coalition government is removing impediments and facilitating major projects which will deliver real jobs to Australians.</PARA></ANSWER>

We saw that there was a major priority to be given to child care and that it was a priority that families should be able to feel secure when they put their children into child care, that there should be a high quality of child care and that those families could actually afford their child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite peculiar that this government continues to deny any responsibility for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increasing cost of child care when clearly the EPAC report on child care stated that in fact there would be an increase of between $15 and $25 per week if the operational subsidy for community based child care was abolished. Despite having the EPAC report, despite being aware of the consequences of their actions, this government made exactly that decision. They decided to abolish the operational subsidy for community based child&hyphen;care centres after having been advised by EPAC that it would cause an increase of between $15 and $25 a week per child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the only place that they have made cuts. They have frozen the ceiling for child&hyphen;care assistance so that parents pay more. They have reduced the child&hyphen;care cash rebate so that families pay more. They have also taken away the operational subsidies for before and after school care for children who access those centres, and that will take effect as of 27 April next year. So not only are cuts having effect already but also in the future there will be a greater impact on families. Again, the government is in denial. They believe that it has no effect on families if child care is more expensive and they think that it has no effect on families if they are no longer able to access formal care, which is the high quality that I believe parents are entitled to expect. Every survey that has been done suggests the two things I have stated: that fees are going up and that the quality of child care is going down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister certainly tried to erode those facts by attacking the survey. But that is not the only source of these statements. It is also what was stated by NACBCS&mdash;the child-care centres themselves say that this is the case, not only the New South Wales government. Most peculiar of all, the Department of Health and Family Services itself concedes that the cost of child care has gone up and that parents are paying more for child care than they did previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems really peculiar to me that the families of Australia are smart enough to know that they are losing out in child care but this government does not seem to want to see it. They believe that it is all right if parents cannot access child care. They believe that it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9353"> is fine if women have to reduce their hours of work because that fits into their view of what child care is about. Child care should be available so that women are able to exercise their proper choice. Not only should it be available, it should be of a high quality. All the surveys that have been reported in the last six months and the evidence of the department itself suggest that child&hyphen;care centres are being forced to make savings. The effect of those savings is that child care goes down in its quality. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know when the government is on the right track when you see a report of a peak industry body coming out and supporting reforms to child care. I refer to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  of 22 November 1997 which reports national child&hyphen;care association president, Mr Chris Buck, saying that the legislation was now acceptable to the child&hyphen;care industry. It is difficult to see what is being complained about. It is said that there are cuts in child&hyphen;care places yet it is as clear as crystal that, in fact, there are additional child&hyphen;care places&mdash;83,000 extra child&hyphen;care places will now be provided over the next four years with 44,000 new private sector places and 39,000 new community long day care, family day care and outside school hours care places between 1997&hyphen;98 and 2000&hyphen;01. If that does not underscore the government's commitment to and recognition of access to child care as an essential component of women's involvement in the paid work force it is difficult to see what else does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only, of course, women's involvement in the work force, it is parents' involvement in the work force. This government is committed to ensuring that all parents have fair and equitable access to both flexible and affordable high quality care options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of complaints are about the fact that community centres have been rationalised or closed since August 1996. However, they have closed as a result of low utilisation not because of a loss of operational subsidy. Most of the closures have been due to the fact there were not enough child&hyphen;care places in areas where they were needed and too many in areas where they were not needed. Just a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> casual glance at some key statistics that were provided recently to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee shows very starkly that private centres not in receipt of an operational subsidy have been providing far more child&hyphen;care places more economically than those centres that received operational subsidies. If you look at the Australia&hyphen;wide figures, for instance, you will find that the number of babies aged under two years in child&hyphen;care centres Australia&hyphen;wide was 14,000 in community based centres receiving a large taxpayer subsidy and 26,000 in private centres not in receipt of an operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to government the child&hyphen;care program was out of control, with oversupply in some areas while families elsewhere had little access to the child care they desperately needed. We have set about correcting this problem with our planned approach to both growth and need. Most of the families using centres that have closed have found alternative child care in other centres or in family day care. We have ensured that available funds target those most in need&mdash;specifically low and middle income working families. What could be fairer than that? What could be fairer than a child&hyphen;care system designed to assist those most in need to work and carry out their family commitments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a lot of other changes to child care aimed at correcting problems of access which have been caused by rapid and unregulated growth in child care. The national planning system to influence new long day care centres to locate in areas of most unmet need is an absolute key priority with this government. There are 25,000 extra family day care places to be provided over the next four years and they are intended to lessen the pressure on families in rural and remote areas by providing places where they are most needed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coonan says that you can tell that the government is on the right track because a private operator in Queensland, who has fought and complained bitterly about every change government has introduced, is finally satisfied with some of the changes. Well, I can tell you when the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9354"> government is on the right track, Senator&mdash;when today's poll tells you that you are ahead of the opposition, not behind it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not on the right track. It is sadly off track and today's polls prove it. They prove it conclusively and, what is more, a lot of the people who are voting against this Howard government are women. One of the reasons they are voting against this government is because of the changes to child care. You are creating in child care what you have already done to aged care: a monumental stuff&hyphen;up. The people out there know it, and they are already registering their great dissatisfaction about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan did the slickest snow job on child care data that I have heard in a long time. To give just one small example of her skating over the facts, she said there were 14,000 baby places in community based child care compared to 26,000 baby places&mdash;which, I note she changed to nought&hyphen; to two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old places&mdash;in the private centres. It is just as well she did, because that approximates truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very, very few baby places in private centres. There are a whole lot of places for six months to 18 months, and certainly above 12 months. There are very few baby places&mdash;which most of us take to mean below six months, and certainly below 12 months. The community based centre has borne the weight of baby places, and the community based places are being closed out of existence by this government's direct policies. How can you say community child care is doing all right when 25 community based centres have already closed and many more are under way to closure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan says the good thing about this government is that it is doing its child&hyphen;care planning, but the only long day care centres that were planned for areas of high need were the community based centres, precisely the ones that are now being closed because of this government's direct policy cuts in operational subsidy, in child&hyphen;care assistance, in the amount of child&hyphen;care cash rebate&mdash;direct policies that have seen the closure of the centres that were put where the need was highest and where the community wanted the centres. They have now closed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the ones that are being left are Mr Chris Buck's&mdash;rampaging across Queensland unfettered and unplanned. Of course he likes planning. It means all the places he has already got set up are going to be there at a higher and higher premium, as there is now a reduction in competition to his area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me not be misunderstood. I strongly support the localising of child&hyphen;care centres where they need to be and not the unfettered private planning that crowded them all into south&hyphen;east Queensland and north&hyphen;east New South Wales. But let us not view Mr Chris Buck's praise as anything more than it is: the voice of self&hyphen;interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got families and mothers telling us, in report after report, that they are leaving child care because the costs are rising too steeply for them. Everybody knows that there is a limit which families can cope with, and after that&mdash;whether it is $10 or $20&mdash;it just tips families over into, `It is no longer affordable or manageable in our family.' Families are leaving child care; mothers are leaving child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about choice, but you are restricting the choice of families in child care. They cannot make the same choice for a community based centre now as they used to, because 25, 30 or more are closed or closing. They no longer have access to community based child care. It is no good saying, `Well, they can use family day care.' They chose not to, and now they are being forced to. They do not want to use family day care. They want the benefits of a child care centre, they want the benefits of a community based centre and they want the benefits of that commitment to quality which has been only very grudgingly given by a large section of the private child care sector&mdash;quality that is now under threat from your government's promise to reappraise it. You have not even appointed the national child care advisory committee that will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is in disarray and the families of Australia know it. They are marching with their feet out of child care because they cannot afford it, and they are already beginning to vote against this government's awful, awful behaviour in child care. This is another

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is just a breathtaking exercise, but then again who would take any notice of Senator Crowley, who comes along to estimates committees as a former minister in this area and actually asks the department what happened when she was minister. She actually has to be reminded of the policies that she put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the opposition of exactly what we inherited when we came to government. We inherited a child&hyphen;care program that was out of control, with oversupply in some areas while families elsewhere had little access to the child care they needed. The allegation that the removal of the operational subsidy has been the sole cause of closures is just blatantly wrong, and Senator Neal knows it. She has sat on enough community affairs committee hearings to know the truth about this, but not one thing that she contributed in her five minutes of rambling on this&mdash;neither did Senator Crowley&mdash;actually reflected what has been told to her time and time again. The community centres that have closed since August 1996 closed as a result of low utilisation, not the loss of the operational subsidy. Most of that, of course, was due to the oversupply of child&hyphen;care places in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inequities in the system between community and private sector have been removed with the discontinuation of that operational subsidy for the very good reason that, out of the community centres, 70,000 families benefited. But the reality was that in the private centres 200,000 families never benefited. For some reason the opposition thinks that it is fair that you can favour 70,000 while disadvantaging 200,000. Senator Crowley just spoke the most unbelievable load of nonsense! The figures are a few months old now, but the fact remains that there were 45,600 community based centre places, as against 122,500 private places, and the number of families utilising those places was 70,000 versus 220,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot deny that, but Senator Crowley also says that Senator Coonan misrepresented 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the number of babies in those two streams of centres. Senator Coonan did not misrepresent them at all. The numbers, as she said, of those from zero to two in the community based centre total 14,000 and in the private centres, 26,000. The numbers of children with additional needs in the community based centres total 16,300; in private centres, 31,000. The places in rural and remote areas&mdash;areas that people on the other side do not even bother to think about&mdash;total 9,100 in community based centres and in private centres, 20,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the facts. You cannot just walk away from them and you cannot also walk away from the fact that an estimated $4.9 billion has been allocated to child care over the next four years&mdash;and those opposite are talking about no money being allocated! I say to Senator Neal, it is in the budget papers; it is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and the general community by supporting the provision of affordable, quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 3.4 million children in Australia aged between 10 and 12 years. The number of places in long day care centres in June 1996 was 168,000 and one year later it was 182,000. Twelve months ago, the number of family day care places was 60,000; it is now 62,700. Outside school age care: 71,800 up to 79,000 and the other figures all go up, too. Yet the opposition would have one believe that the figures are all trending down. They simply are not. At some stage, truth has to be told in these debates. It does not matter whether it is aged care, health care, child care or whatever; there is just constant, repetitious misrepresentation of the facts and, sadly, five minutes does not do justice to being able to get that message across.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting to hear what government senators have to say about this issue of child care funding. I listened to the answers Minister Herron gave earlier today and he was clearly having a lot of regard for the briefing that he had been given by his senior minister, Mr Warwick Smith, the member for Bass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9356">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just happen to have received the latest issue of Mr Smith's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warwick's Bass Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of November 1997. Senators might be keen to know that his name appears in the four&hyphen;page bulletin 21 times and his picture appears seven times. Child care is mentioned once in terms of his `challenging new role' and, at another time, in an article which says: `Warwick Smith delivers $20 million to Bass'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the article he lists a bit under $5 million worth of expenditure; the only expenditure that is relevant to child care is $21,500. So roughly 0.04 per cent of the expenditure that he wants to champion for his own electorate is attributable to child care, the area that he now admits that he has responsibility for. That is a very low level priority because this government gives it a very low level priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been taking from this area, as Senator Neal said, $820 million in expected expenditure&mdash;expenditure that the Labor government was intending to put into this area because it is necessary. It is necessary because there are families in this community who require two incomes to survive, particularly in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, where mortgages are huge, where both parents need to be working to raise a family and to acquire a family home. Let us not forget the fact that child care places grew enormously under the previous Labor government. They grew because Labor made a commitment to the funding of additional places through the community sector, and the community sector has grown and grown to provide many places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it had been possible for the private sector to be providing those places, then that expenditure would not have been necessary, but the private sector was not able to. The private sector was not providing quality care. It was not providing the sort of care that parents could afford. So the Hawke Labor government and then the Keating Labor government funded child care so that those places were available and so that there was quality care&mdash;care that parents could rely upon and care that parents wanted for their children. They also funded growth in the family day care situation. There was exponential growth in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> availability of child care because that is what Australian parents needed and wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that the New South Wales Council of Social Service poll of about 400 parents was in some ways inadequate. It may not have been one that was conducted by a polling company; it may not have been conducted at the cost of many thousands of dollars, as many of the government's own polls are; but it was conducted so as to give parents a chance to have their say, because they are the factors the government has forgotten in this debate. They are the people who should be listened to, not the Mr Bucks who really are interested in this industry only because of the bucks and not because of the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry is supposed to be servicing the parents and the children of this country, so when the council of social service has gone out and invited people to make their comments and then reported them, what does the minister in this place do? He criticises the council for seeking their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister and the senior minister, Warwick Smith, should get out and get the views of the parents. If the ministers saw the AGB McNair poll in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> they would have seen something they never expected to see, and that is that not only are they behind in the poll overall, but they are also behind in the poll in which the women of Australia, by an overwhelming majority, have rejected this government. They have rejected this government because it is an inept government, particularly so in the area of child care. This government has got a lot to learn. I do not think it can resurrect itself; it has done enormous damage to the issue of child care and thereby enormous damage to itself.</PARA></SPEECH>

It would be very wrong of you to assume that, just because the polls at mid&hyphen;term are low, the government will not be returned for a very long time to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up Senator Crowley's comment that the child care proposal disad 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9357"> vantages women. I just want to make the point that the government is committed to policies which allow women to make real choices between paid work and staying at home to care for children or others at different stages of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that access to child care is essential to women's involvement in paid work. Indeed, women have retained their share of total employment at 43 per cent of the work force over the last calendar year, which proves what nonsense Senator Crowley's comments were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to ensuring that parents have fair and equitable access to flexible, affordable and high quality child care. This government is spending over $1 billion a year on child care, and the 1997 budget provides for the continued growth of additional child&hyphen;care facilities and for increased support to be given to families with children who use out of school hours care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the family tax initiative recognises the cost of raising children, by providing increased financial assistance to people who care for children, particularly when there is a full&hyphen;time carer at home. The Workplace Relations Act also provides opportunities for flexibility in employment, to respond to the needs of parents and their work places. So Senator Crowley did not do her research very well at all and what she said was totally wrong. This government has paid a lot of attention to the needs of women in the work force who need child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 21 years the number of women in the paid work force with dependent children under 15 years of age has increased from 44 per cent to 59 per cent. Strong and continuing growth in the number of women who participate in the work force and have dependent children has resulted in increased demand for child care. This government has responded to that demand by providing, as I have said, an estimated $4.9 billion for child care over the next four years. Expenditure is forecast to increase from $1.1 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 to $1.3 billion in 2000&hyphen;01 in the government's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This increased funding will mean the number of child&hyphen;care places will grow by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some 25 per cent over the next four years. That will more than meet the expected increase in the work force participation rate of women. In the next two years priority will be given to the establishment of places in neighbourhoods and communities which have high demand and not enough places currently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 425,000 children in formal, long day care, as at 30 June this year, about 78 per cent were in care for work related reasons. The parents of the remaining 22 per cent were not in the paid work force but required respite from or developmental opportunities for their children. The government has introduced reforms to the child&hyphen;care system to achieve a better balance between child care for work related reasons and child&hyphen;care for respite or developmental reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For your interest, Madam Deputy President, and for the interest of the Senate, we have a chart here which lists Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing the level of participation of women in the work force, including those with dependent children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry is an historic inquiry because its involves two Parliamentary Committees in two jurisdictions&mdash;the JCPA and the Queensland Public Accounts Committee. The result is a joint, unanimous, report which is being tabled simultaneously in both Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils receive funding from both Commonwealth and Queensland agencies. For some time now the Queensland Auditor&hyphen;General has been issuing qualifications and disclaimers to the annual audited financial statements of a significant number of Councils. The QPAC has tabled several reports on the issue, but progress has been slow in improving Council accountability. For that reason, and because Councils receive money from the Commonwealth, QPAC approached the JCPA with a view to undertaking the inquiry to explore the underlying causes for the Councils' apparent difficulty in meeting their accountability requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 25 March 1997 the House of Representatives authorised the Committee to jointly inquire with the QPAC and established a set of procedures to be followed. You will recall that on the following day the Senate concurred with this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry focused on the scope for standardising the financial accountability requirements placed on Aboriginal and Island Councils and how the Councils may be assisted in meeting their accountability obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry the Committees visited most of the Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils. Many of the communities serviced by these Councils are in remote areas and suffer the consequences of this isolation in the form of poor infrastructure provision, precarious lines of supply and difficulty in attracting and retaining suitably qualified staff. The Committees were impressed at the hospitality of the Councils they visited, their dedication to serving 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9373"> the communities they represent, and their motivation to address problems highlighted in their audited financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the inquiry progressed the value of a joint approach has been confirmed. Each Committee has been able to examine the issues from the perspective of both jurisdictions. Agencies from both the State and Commonwealth have appeared before the Committees at public hearings and have discussed matters which are cross&hyphen;jurisdictional in nature. Agencies have been brought together on the issues of application processes, accountability requirements, and assistance provision to Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees have concluded that there is sufficient scope for standardising application and acquittal processes but, because deficiencies in the financial administration of Councils have been identified by the Queensland Auditor&hyphen;General for over ten years, the most practical way forward is to constitute a Grants Providers Forum at Ministerial level. The key initial responsibility of this forum would be the introduction of standardised financial acquittal and reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees also agreed that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Queensland Department of Families, Youth and Community Care, which represent the major grant providers to the Councils, should immediately commence negotiation to achieve standardisation of their grant application and acquittal processes. The Committees feel that cooperation by these agencies will address a large percentage of the current variations in accountability requirements faced by Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees have gone further and have examined some of the underlying reasons leading to the qualifications and disclaimers in the audited financial statements. The Committees are of the view that the expertise available to Councils is a critical factor in their ability to provide unqualified audited financial statements. Accordingly, the Committees spent some time in considering how Councils may be assisted in improving performance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees have concluded that there needs to be better coordination by agencies in the provision of assistance to Councils and have recommended that Commonwealth and State agencies should work together in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increasing communication between ATSIC's field officers and Community Service Officers (who are officers of the lead Queensland agency);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> assessing the training needs of Councils; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> coordinating training provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees have identified a key inconsistency in accountability mechanisms in that ATSIC can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appoint a Grants Controller for poor performing Councils whose task is to look after Commonwealth funds. No such step is available to Queensland agencies and the only avenue available is to replace the Council with an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committees have recommended that Grants Controllers should also be able to administer State funds. In addition, the Grant Providers Forum should further address the issue of inadequate financial compliance, and maladministration of Council business, with a view to implementing a range of procedures between, at one extreme, unsupervised control by a Council of its business and, at the other, the appointment of an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding, on behalf of the Committee, I extend my appreciation to those people who contributed to the review by meeting the Committees during their inspection visits and briefings, by preparing submissions, and giving evidence at public hearings. I would like to thank my colleagues on the JCPA Committee and also members of the Queensland Public Accounts Committee. The inquiry and this report is a fine example of cooperation between Commonwealth and State with the aim of improving public administration and the welfare of indigenous peoples.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BALLAST WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997, is to enable a research and development levy to be collected from certain ships arriving in Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 will introduce a levy on certain ships to provide funding for the Strategic Ballast Water Research and Development Program. This is to fund research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention, of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens transported in ballast water and on ships' hulls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 will provide the framework for collection of the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the last 10 years Australia has led the world in developing ballast water management strategies aimed at minimising the risk to Australia's marine environment, our fisheries and aquaculture industries, and on human health, posed by unmanaged ballast water discharge in Australian waters. In 1990, Australia was the first country in the world to introduce national voluntary controls to apply to the discharge of shipping ballast water and sediment from overseas vessels entering Australian territory. This initiative was subsequently adopted by the international maritime organisation when, in 1991, it incorporated the principles of the Australian arrangements for international application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has also been at the forefront of the development within the international maritime organisation of a new annex to the Marpol convention&hyphen; the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships&hyphen; specifically for ballast 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> water. It is hoped this annex will be internationally agreed by the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia as an island nation and a major exporter of minerals and agricultural products is heavily dependent on shipping. Some 98 per cent of all cargo moved into and out of Australia is by ships. As such, we are also a major importer of ballast water from other countries. Each year, approximately 120 million tonnes of ballast water is discharged from over 6,000 vessels arriving at Australia's 40 ports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While ballast water has been used by shipping for around 100 years, it is only recently that the extent of the problem has become known. As shipping traffic increases, as ships become faster, and as many of the ports with which Australia trades become more polluted, then the threat to Australian waterways has increased enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has already been established that at least 15 unwanted aquatic species and organisms, including fish, molluscs, worms and a toxic algae, have been transferred to Australia and established here. The most likely source of transfer is ballast water. A number of these species and organisms have the potential to cause serious diseases which are harmful to humans, animals, plants and seafood production and the marine environment. These unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens are carried in ballast water and can establish in our harbours and waterways after the ballast water is discharged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ballast water management is recognised internationally as an important global issue, and Australian scientists were among the first to recognise the risks posed by ballast water. It is for these reasons that in 1995, Australia developed its ballast water management strategy. The strategic ballast water research and development program which is a key component of the strategy was subsequently developed by the Australian ballast water management advisory council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent review of Australia's quarantine arrangements by Professor Malcolm Nairne not only recognised that this was an important issue, but one that is an international issue of environmental and quarantine concern. He recommended that Australia maintain an international leadership role in relation to ballast water management. The government fully agrees with this recommendation, and through the coasts and clean seas initiative recently announced by the prime minister, has demonstrated it's commitment by allocating $1 million for the strategic ballast water research program for 1997/98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In so far as ballast water is concerned, the coast and clean seas initiative also provides for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the reduction, management and local eradication of introduced marine pests 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9375">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a rapid response capability to manage and eradicate marine pest outbreaks before they become established in new locations </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the implementation of management arrangements and guidelines to prevent the spread of pests transferred by coastal shipping</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a modest research and development program has been in place for some years, it has been funded largely on an ad hoc basis, primarily by the government but also with some industry assistance. In 1997/98 as noted above,  it will be almost fully funded through the coasts and clean seas initiative. Funding is required therefore beyond 1997/98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian ballast water management advisory council, which includes shipping and bulk exporting representatives, has had this matter under consideration for some time. The council supports the introduction of a levy on shipping to fund the strategic ballast water research and development program. This agreement by industry to the implementation of a levy on shipping for two years to fund the research and development of effective ballast water management, is an indication of their commitment to resolving the risks posed to Australia from ships' ballast water and hulls. This industry is to be complimented on their cooperation and support in establishing this funding mechanism in the endeavour to develop technically and environmentally acceptable solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current major research projects include the development of a decision support system, an information and communications system to monitor and support decision making concerning the risk of individual vessels and required ballast management arrangements;  port baseline surveys, to ascertain existing port conditions;  and heat treatment of ballast water, as a possible means of killing unwanted marine pests and pathogens. Future projects will include further evaluation of techniques for the detection of cholera in ballast water, identification of high risk vessels and routes, and the implementation of protocols for ballast water sampling and testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collection of the levy is to commence on 1 July 1998 and will operate for a period of 2 years, ceasing once the agreed amount has been collected. The amount to be collected is $2 million with a 10 per cent variation to allow for fluctuations in collection, and interest accrued on the fund account will be added to the fund. The amount of the levy is $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for all other ships, including tankers, with a length of 50 metres or longer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation has the full support of not only those directly affected by the ballast water issue, but those who will pay the levy in the shipping industry. They have not only agreed to the levy but have been a party to all aspects of the proposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> administration of the levy including the purposes to which it is to be allocated. That is, to enable the conduct of research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention, of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens found in ballast water and on ships' hulls.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 provides the mechanism for the collection of the levy. It provides information and explanations of liability for the levy. The ship's owner, master, agent or consignee are liable to pay the levy on behalf of a ship, and this levy is payable on the first day of each quarter on behalf of ships arriving at Australian ports. These categories include both coastal and international shipping. This bill also provides emergency categories for situations when a ship is exempted from paying the levy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are debating here are opposition amendments which would style what the government ludicrously calls a `surcharge' with a more accurate description of it&mdash;a tax. When we concluded last night, the indications were that Senator Harradine was in favour of recognising a spade as a spade; I understood the Greens to have been in the same position; and I am not sure about the Australian Democrats. The government, through the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, who was the minister at the table, regarded a spade called a shovel, to quote the minister's words, as still a spade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that that is very confusing because a spade and a shovel are two distinctly different entities. They are not the same, and you cannot interpose their names. But with a surcharge you can. There are any sorts of authorities which define the meanings of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the English language in dictionary form that attest to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the sake of this debate, since it is a tax debate, let me tell you that what the Australian Tax Office says of this matter ought to be a guide for this chamber. As I indicated last night, on 9 September this year the Australian Taxation Office, in a media release which referred to this measure, said in its headline: `Quote Your Tax File Number to Avoid 15 Per Cent Tax'. It had no misgivings about calling this a tax. It is a tax. The Taxation Office called it that in the headline of its article dealing with one element of it. Therefore, it would seem inappropriate, to say the least, but misleading to say the obvious, for this chamber to name it exclusively a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the government wants to do this is clear. We know the reason. We know the motivation. At the last election the government ran a platform on which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the shadow Treasurer at the time, Mr Costello, who is now the Treasurer, told Australians that there would be no increase in taxation and no extension of existing taxes. They made that their solemn pre-election promise to the Australian community. Of course, in this budget they have brought forward a measure which they have called a surcharge because they do not want to be in a position of being proven to be hypocritical about what they had promised. They do not want to be in a situation in which it was proven they said one thing and did another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Taxation Office has blown the gaff on them and in fact has named what the government calls a surcharge a tax. As a consequence, the government stands convicted in the eyes of the Australian taxpayers as breaking a solemn election promise. They promised not to increase taxes. This is clearly and palpably an increase in taxes. You can call it by whatever name you wish, but unmistakably it is a tax, and the English meaning of what is being done here is `to impose a tax'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me, to use the jargon, to be a `no brainer'. This parliament should recognise the truth of the matter and not put up with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9377"> charade and call it a tax. That is all our amendments do. I understand now that the Australian Democrats may not wish to agree to them. If that is so, I would be extremely disappointed. I would be disappointed for the reason that the Democrats have built their reputation on the slogan `keeping the bastards honest'. Being honest about the use of the English language is one of the obvious things to do.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment will require the commissioner to pay interest if a taxpayer fails to provide a tax file number for whatever reason and later provides one. It is well known that the Australian Democrats along with the ALP, industry, unions and business all oppose the government's preferred collection mechanism and would have preferred to have a collection mechanism based on group certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the government that insisted on this somewhat ridiculous mechanism that requires the funds to chase down the tax file numbers of their members, at enormous costs to those funds. According to evidence from Jacques Martin, after three letters to their fund members the response rate was as low as 23 per cent. The government tells me that its later surveys suggest that the response rate is up to 40 per cent and is confident that its data matching will bring it up to 65 per cent or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that will still leave somewhere between two million and three million Australians paying the surcharge who should not be paying the surcharge. They should not be penalised if, when they finally understand the impact of the legislation, they then provide the tax file number. Our amendment will ensure that, if a refund of surcharge is paid to their super fund, they will also get the interest. I think that is entirely reasonable. It is not the taxpayers' fault that the government has insisted on such a flawed and quite stupid collection mechanism that funds, let alone 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9379"> fund members, are having great difficulty in understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be up to the government I think to persuade people that the tax file numbers must be provided. This measure will see that those people who do pay their surcharge unnecessarily are not penalised. I commend this amendment to senators.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will support this amendment. This amendment entitles those superannuation providers who have paid the surcharge tax unnecessarily because an individual fund member did not provide their tax file number the right to an interest payment on top of the surcharge tax refund the provider may receive if the fund member subsequently provides their tax file number. In other words, if you are getting a refund because of a mispayment, you get the value of interest for the tax office holding those funds for a period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the reports from some superannuation funds of the small number of people who are providing their tax file numbers&mdash;meaning that their superannuation provider will be subject to a tax liability, which they will pass on to the individual fund member&mdash;the opposition believes that this measure will go some way towards limiting the impact the surcharge tax will have on low and middle income earners. However, as with all the administrative arrangements associated with this measure, there will be a higher compliance cost to the Australian Taxation Office in processing the plethora of claims for refund and interest of surcharge tax payments that will most certainly arise next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That low and middle income earners will pay the tax is, unfortunately, something that cannot and will not be avoided. However, Labor believes that this amendment will provide low and middle income earners with some justice for having to pay the surcharge tax provided that superannuation providers pass the interest payments and refund on to the individuals. For those reasons, we would support the Australian Democrat amendment and hope the government would be gracious enough to do so as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. We act as people would expect us to act&mdash;not like the former government. We will not be supporting the amendment. As I have said on a number of occasions, no low and middle income earner need be subject to the surcharge. They merely have to quote their TFN to their fund or to the ATO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full 15 per cent surcharge rate will apply only to accounts that existed before 7 May 1997 where the surchargeable contributions exceed the contributions threshold of $2,000. The assumption is that these members are high income earners. A nil rate of surcharge will apply to accounts that existed for a member before 7 May 1997 where surchargeable contributions do not exceed the contribution threshold of $2,000. I think this was an amendment which the Democrats moved. I think we moved to provide further assurance that the Democrats were seeking in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 15 per cent surcharge rate will apply to new accounts opened on or after 7 May 1997, regardless of whether the surchargeable contributions exceed the contribution threshold of $2,000. There was an extensive debate in the chamber on that and I think that was accepted as a reasonable position. Trustees of course are now required to request that a member quote their TFN on entry to the fund. The commissioner is required to take all reasonable steps to identify members before issuing a surcharge assessment. The commissioner must write to a member on at least two occasions requesting that the member quotes their TFN if the commissioner is unable to identify the member through ATO records. The ATO has also expended considerable resources to ensure that all members are aware of the consequences of not quoting to funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The non-payment of interest when an assessment is amended after the subsequent quotation of a TFN is similar to other taxation consequences for failure to quote a TFN. For 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9380"> example, tax is withheld at the top marginal tax rate if a TFN is not quoted to an employer. The same applies to a failure to quote under the prescribed payments and reportable payment systems and to non-quotation to an investment body in connection with an investment. The person can claim a credit for the tax withheld in these circumstances, but no interest is payable. So we are creating here a special exemption in this case. The government is sticking with its original position and sticking with the precedent on this matter. We are opposed to the amendment. I hope the committee will support the government's position, which is a consistent position in relation to tax file numbers.</PARA></SPEECH>

The government says that refund stipulation could be done administratively and that, in this case, interest is not paid on overpayments in relation to tax file numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge situation is different from normal overpayments because the interaction is not between the taxpayer and the Australian tax office but between the Australian tax office and a superannuation fund. The superannuation fund tries to contact a member and fails, so it cannot get the tax file number. The Australian tax office tries hard to match and fails, so it cannot get the tax file number. If the taxpayer cannot be contacted or uniquely identified by the Australian tax office, how do they know what is happening?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would not occur if it were the taxpayer being directly assessed. If they subsequently found out perhaps years later, why shouldn't they get the refund with interest? They would have made interest on their superannuation deposit. While the Australian tax office is insistent that it is mostly getting matches, this situation basically arises where it does not make them; so information may not be flowing to the taxpayer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, that is correct. Senator Cook posed a question and I am now in a position to respond to Senator Cook. The question was, `Can a person complain to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal about the amount deducted from their superannuation benefits for surcharge purposes?' I have been advised that a person may complain to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal that a decision by a superannuation provider in relation to the person is unfair or unreasonable. For example, a person may complain that the decision of the superannuation provider to reduce their superannuation benefits to pay a surcharge liability is unfair or unreasonable on the basis that the amount deducted is greater than the 15 per cent of their surchargeable contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to a complaint that the decision of the superannuation provider is unfair and unreasonable, the tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the superannuation provider. In particular, the tribunal may affirm, vary or set aside the superannuation provider's decision or remit the matter to the superannuation provider for reconsideration. However, the tribunal must affirm the decision of a superannuation provider if it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two grounds upon which a complaint about the superannuation provider's decision may be excluded from the tribunal's jurisdiction. First, such a complaint could be excluded on the grounds that it relates to the management of the fund as a whole. However, where a superannuation provider decides 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9381"> the amount to deduct from a person's superannuation benefits, this is unlikely to be considered a decision that relates to the management of the fund as a whole. Ultimately, whether a complaint relates to the management of the fund as a whole is a matter for the tribunal to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the tribunal has a discretion to exclude complaints from its jurisdiction where more than 12 months have elapsed from the date of the decision of the superannuation provider to the date of the complaint to the tribunal. Under the superannuation and advisory legislation, a superannuation provider must disclose to members annually the amount deducted from a person's superannuation benefits for surcharge purposes.</PARA></SPEECH>

This still means that, even though a complaints mechanism is available, an individual can only claim overpayment on the surcharge from his or her own trust, not from the tax commissioner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would ask a question, since I think I started this series of questions. I am trying to navigate through the bureaucratic language of what you have just read out, Senator, and the situation presents itself to me like this. If a member of a superannuation fund believes that the superannuation provider has misadvised the tax office, then that member of the fund can appeal to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has the power to stand&mdash;to quote you from last night&mdash;in the shoes of the provider and make a determination on what is fair and reasonable. So the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal decides that you are right&mdash;that the individual fund member is right&mdash;and that is their decision. That decision, I presume, then binds the provider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: does it bind the tax office? If the tax office takes the view that the provider was right in the first instance, can the tribunal make their decision stick against the tax office, or does the poor benighted member of the superannuation fund have to go to another tribunal, the tax ombudsman, or someone such as that, in order to get the primary decision made by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal stick against the tax office? You will appreciate that, in terms of enforcing their right through this maze of quasi&hyphen;judicial authorities, this is where the little person in Australia stands.

Starting with the person I am concerned about&mdash;the little person in Australia, a member of a fund&mdash;the superannuation provider reports a figure; the member of the fund says, `That is the wrong figure,' and carts the superannuation provider off to the tribunal. The tribunal upholds the right of the superannuation fund member. The tax office then decides it will audit the fund and comes to a different assessment. In other words, the decision of the tribunal is not binding on the tax office; they are not bound to accept that. If the individual fund member wants to dispute the taxation department's ruling, they have to take another process&mdash;through the ombudsman or some such process as that; maybe through the courts.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are consequential amendments arising out of the opposition's amendments agreed to by the Senate last night. The opposition's amendments agreed to yesterday, which these consequential amendments apply to, were: the application of allocated surplus amounts to begin from 1 July 1997, instead of from 20 August 1997; the inclusion of a prohibition of avoidance scheme clause; and the consistent taxation treatment of golden handshakes, whether taken as cash or rolled over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of the treatment of golden handshakes, after discussions with the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), which I thank the Assistant Treasurer for, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition is moving further amendments to give effect to our earlier amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional amendments will have the effect of exempting golden handshakes rolled over in the period between 20 August 1996 and 30 June 1997 from paying the surcharge tax. The reason for this measure is that, similar to the situation for the allocated surplus amounts, superannuation funds would have an additional complicating administrative burden if they had to go back and determine which part of a rolled over golden handshake was pre&hyphen; or post&hyphen; 20 August 1996. This administrative burden, if not improved by this amendment, would involve further delays in the assessment of surcharge tax liabilities and, importantly, additional compliance costs for superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After discussions with the government, it has been agreed that the best way of avoiding these additional compliance costs is to exempt a certain class of golden handshakes from the surcharge tax altogether. The opposition believes that this is not the most desirable outcome because for the period 20 August 1996 to 30 June 1997 there will be an inconsistent arrangement for golden handshakes rolled over, compared to those taken in cash. However, given the limited time frame that this inconsistency will operate for, and the potential increase in compliance costs for superannuation funds, we believe that this is the best possible outcome, or the best of all worst worlds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make the point that from 1 July 1997 all golden handshake payments will be treated consistently, regardless of whether they are taken in cash or rolled over. It is unfortunate that there will be a short period where the treatment is inconsistent. This could have been avoided had the government treated golden handshakes consistently in the first place. Nonetheless, the opposition's amendments will give effect to the consistent treatment from 1 July this year. I commend the consequential amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S111">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 (No. 3)</XREF> contains a number of proposals in respect of amending tariff levels and also in respect of some technical and administrative issues. The opposition's position is that the fundamental issue involved in this legislation concerns the abolition of the $55 per tonne tariff on sugar. Whilst we do not oppose other aspects of the bill, nevertheless we strongly oppose this legislation which would give effect to an earlier decision of this government that from 1 July this year the $55 per tonne tariff on sugar will be removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspects of the bill with which we do not have any objection relate to changes in respect of the Canada&hyphen;Australia Trade Agreement which accorded certain imports of Canadian petrochemicals duty&hyphen;free entry. Those issues are dealt with in schedule 2 of the bill. There are also in schedule 3 changes which relate to the list of countries accorded concessions under Australia's system of tariff preferences. By this measure, territories administered by the Palestinian Authority will be accorded that status. There are also other changes in respect of a whole list of items set out in the remainder of schedule 4 which I do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9387"> not need to detail in my speech. They are set  out in the explanatory memorandum to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My remarks will be directed solely therefore to the issue of the sugar tariff. I might indicate that when the bill gets to the committee stage I will be moving the request circulated on sheet No. 751 which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4, items 1 to 5, page 7 (lines 6 to 20), omit the items.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are the items which give effect to the removal of the $55 per tonne tariff on sugar and on sugar&hyphen;related products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the reasons why we oppose this removal of the sugar tariff? One of the most important reasons is that this measure by this government is a complete and utter breach of a promise made by the coalition at the last election. I am sure that we in this parliament and people in the community have got used to the fact that this government continually breaks its election promises. People have got used to the fact that that is what they do, but they have not got used to the results of the impact of those breaches of promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The polls demonstrate that people no longer trust this government; they no longer believe this government; they certainly do not feel relaxed and comfortable about this government's promises being breached. They are storing all this up and they will give a clear and unequivocal message to this government come the next federal election. We believe that it is important to endeavour to force this government to adhere to its promises, particularly when the results of breaching those promises mean that people in this community will suffer. There is no doubt that, as a result of the removal of the $55 per tonne tariff on sugar, sugar cane farmers will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate of what the then coalition opposition said in its primary industries policy that it took to the 1996 federal election. It said it would not remove the tariff on sugar. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National Government will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/ tonne as we have already met our

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely clear, Senator Woodley. You could not get anything clearer. It says `We will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 per tonne.' They even gave a reason why they would not do that. The reason was that there was no necessity to do this because the tariff levels applicable in the sugar industry were already well within the requirements of WTO&hyphen;GATT. That is a clear and unequivocal promise broken by this government. The second point of their policy said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National government will recognise and uphold the Queensland government's responsibility for administering the single desk export arrangement in that state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will deal with the issue of the single desk later in my speech because, in endeavouring to create some supporting arguments for their decision to abolish the tariff, they have actually gone out on a scaremongering tactic to try to put cane growers in the position that they could either have the tariff or the single desk but they could not have both. As I said, I will come back to that shortly. The third part of their policy was to maintain the Commonwealth sugar infrastructure development program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there has been a total, absolute breach of promise by this government, done without apology and done without any real consultation with those affected in the industry. It is a breach of promise rammed through the House of Representatives without the opportunity for a proper parliamentary debate. They even sought to nobble their own colleagues in the National Party who expressed some concern and outrage over this proposal. I have to say it was a pathetic performance in the end by the members of the National Party who were not prepared to stand up for their constituency on this issue. It will be interesting to see how Senator Boswell and his colleagues vote on this matter later in the afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a breach of promise that sits beside all the other promises that have been broken and decisions that have been taken by this govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9388"> ment that have impacted severely on the bush. Such decisions include the decision to abolish  the Department of Regional Development, the decision to close government services offices in rural and regional Australia and decisions in the health sector, the nursing home sector and a whole range of other sectors where, because of the tyranny of distance that affects them, people in the bush will suffer even more harshly and more significantly than people in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it appears that this government and its National Party coalition partner have lost interest in the bush. As Harry Woods demonstrated when he won the seat of Grafton in that magnificent victory in Clarence just after the last election, when the next federal election comes around, the people of the bush&mdash;and particularly the people in the sugar industry&mdash;are going to remember what this government did to them. The wheat growers will also remember how the government sold them out in respect of the Wheat Marketing Authority Bill which was only dealt with a couple of days ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could talk forever about promises broken by this government, but I have to deal with some other issues relating to this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No. 2. As I said, the decision was taken without any proper opportunity for a parliamentary debate. It was put through and became operative from 1 July. We are now dealing with the legislation that seeks to give legislative effect to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee took the opportunity to consider this legislation. As a committee we provided an opportunity for the cane farmers' representatives and for members of the coalition parties to give evidence to the committee. We had Mr Katter giving evidence to the committee. Senator Woodley will recall that he gave quite extensive evidence to the committee. If we had not been short of time, I am sure he would have gone on a lot longer about the terrible implications of this decision.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODLEY" NAMEID="HX5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And what he thinks of this government.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. And it was the Senate committee that provided people in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry and federal members of parliament representing sugar industry constituencies with the opportunity to express their views. We gave them the opportunity they were never given by this government when it initially pushed this legislation through the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence from the cane farmers was overwhelming, and it was that, while their leaders in the organisations may have agreed with this proposal, while they may have participated in the sugar industry working party which put forward or supported the proposition of abolishing the tariff, the cane farmers out there, firstly, had not been properly consulted and, secondly, made it absolutely clear what they thought of this proposal when they were given the chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They opposed it, and they still oppose it today. I know Senator Woodley will shortly be making some further comments in regard to the specific views of sugar growers and cane farmers in Queensland, but they oppose it for very good reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, they oppose it, as we do, because, as the coalition said in its own policy, which I read a moment ago, the tariff levels that were applicable in the sugar industry were well within the requirements of GATT. If you look at the existing tariff levels in other countries&mdash;such as those in the European Union&mdash;you find a tariff regime of about 170 per cent. That is equivalent to $A797 per tonne. Ours is $A55 and represents some 13 per cent. In the USA the tariff is equivalent to $A506. As the coalition itself said in the policy it took to the last election, there is no doubt that there was no need, under GATT or under a policy to promote freer trade, to tamper with or reduce or change&mdash;let alone to abolish completely&mdash;the sugar tariff. It was well within the requirements of WTO GATT and was certainly much less than our competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the tariff will impact on cane growers and cane farmers. It has been estimated that it will cost them some $30 million a year and could, with the multiplier effect, mean a reduction of some $100 million a year in terms of cost to the industry and to the communities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that individ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9389"> ual cane farmers&mdash;and this was not disputed by any of the parties who appeared before the  inquiry supporting the removal of the tariff&mdash;would, on average, lose some $3,000 income per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might say $3,000 is not a lot of income, but, to a lot of farmers with incomes of $30,000 or $40,000 per year&mdash;and those figures were quoted to us as representing average returns&mdash;that is 10 per cent or more of their income. There are battling farmers out there. I remember the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talking, when he was Leader of the Opposition, about standing up for the battlers. It seems to me that the coalition has ignored not only the battlers in the cities and major towns of this country but also the battlers in the rural communities, those who are clearly working to provide great export wealth for this country. It is going to cost cane farmers around $3,000 a year, and it will clearly have an impact on jobs. There is no doubt it will have an impact on jobs in those regions and in those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other representations to the committee, including the report from the soft drink manufacturers association who are one of the major users of sugar in Australia, also acknowledged that, whilst the growers were going to lose the $3,000 on average income and whilst a tariff was going to be removed, the poor consumer was not going to benefit through lower prices. There was no indication that this would lead to lower prices for consumers. All of those people&mdash;those mums and dads and kids; the entire population basically&mdash;who are out there drinking coca&hyphen;colas or lemonades or products of the soft drink manufacturers, or buying lollies and so on, are not going to get lower prices as a result of this decision. It is going to be the soft drink manufacturers and the other manufacturers who benefit at the expense of the farmers and at the expense of the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn quickly to two other issues, firstly this furphy that if the tariff is not abolished then the single desk arrangements will be lost. I have already drawn attention to the policy of the government at the time it went to the last election, where it clearly on the one hand was supportive of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retention of the tariff and on the other recognised that the single desk needed to be maintained and that the Queensland government, which currently has the responsibility for administering the single desk export arrangements, should continue to undertake that task. It should not disappear. The single desk is not at risk if the tariff is restored, because we go back to the situation that prevailed prior to 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a scare campaign suggesting that, if the tariff is restored, the single desk export marketing arrangements are under threat. That is quite untrue. They are not under threat. As I understand it, the Queensland government recently reiterated its support for the maintenance of the single desk marketing authority. The federal government supports the single desk arrangements. The opposition, when in government and even today, supports that. The industry supports it. It is strongly supported, so there is no reason why it should somehow be under threat simply as a result of maintaining a tariff, which this government said it was committed to doing at the time it came into office. But, unfortunately, there has been this scare campaign and some people in the industry have felt that they had to make a choice between the tariff and the single desk. They do not have to make that choice and nobody should be persuaded that that choice is necessary. The tariff can be retained and so can the single desk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I refer to the merger of CSR and Mackay Refined Sugars and the decision by the ACCC that, as a result of the removal of the tariff, that merger would be approved. It has been indicated in evidence from Professor Fels that if the tariff were to be restored then the approval decision for that merger would clearly have to be reviewed. Our view is that the merger is a good thing. It is supported by the industry and by the companies involved. The decision as to whether that merger should be approved or not should not hang solely on the issue of whether the tariff survives or not, because the merger is good for the industry. It should be a decision, in our view, that stands alone and is not based on the issue of the tariff. We urge you to support the amendment to maintain the tariff. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has finally got around  to bringing this particular bill to the vote&mdash;four months after undermining parliament by scrapping a tariff through a clever bit of paperwork so that we did not have to go to the bother of an actual vote. This is simply another illustration of the corporatisation of parliament. We are moving down the road of a corporate state, where representatives of parliament are regarded as being reasonably irrelevant. They can get to vote occasionally, if they are very good, on one or two things that do not matter; but we will make sure that important decisions are not taken by the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These customs tariffs proposals, which we have learnt a lot more about since the government used one of these nifty little devices to scrap the sugar tariff, are quite undemocratic. Government can just table one of these proposals and it is effective from the day it is tabled. It does not matter that the lives of thousands of farmers are going to be affected and that their representatives have no opportunity to vote on what is happening. It does not matter that communities up and down the Queensland coast and in northern New South Wales will be affected by the decision. It does not matter that those who represent them have no opportunity to debate the issue. That does not really matter to this government because it has no commitment to democratic processes. That is becoming clearer and clearer the further it moves into its term&mdash;I would suggest probably its first and only term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that, once you table one of these proposals and then you try, after the horse has bolted, to do something about it so that people who are affected by the decision have some opportunity to at least have their representatives vote on a small part of it, the government says, `It's gone already.' So, when it comes to the vote, your vote does not really count&mdash;and that is fine by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad finally to have the chance to speak in the Senate on this legislation, after a very long campaign in which the Democrats have tried to bring to public notice the inequities of this government's freezing of car and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> textile tariffs, looking after Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide and then saying, `To heck with Queensland; to heck with northern New South Wales cane farmers. They don't really matter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, but part of the promise&mdash;and I am going to repeat the promise that the government made because I want to reinforce what Senator Forshaw said; and I supported every word of his speech&mdash;was, `Well, if we take your tariff away, we guarantee to you that we will take other tariffs away, too, so that you won't be affected.' But backbenchers in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide seem to have more say with this government than backbenchers in Queensland. While preserving tariffs on cars, textiles, clothing and footwear, the sugar tariff was sent down the drain&mdash;the $55 per tonne which supported the price received by growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry and government have consistently said that the tariff had to go or they would not be able to preserve the single desk selling mechanism. That argument is a complete furphy, as Senator Forshaw said, and I want to reinforce what he said. It always has been a furphy. The industry, the government, the Democrats and the cane farmers know that state and federal governments have huge amounts of discretion when it comes to applying competition policy. We have already seen that with the amazing backflips on car and textile tariffs by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). There is no automatic mechanism which determines that restoration of the sugar tariff means that we must lose the single desk selling system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reinforce that. The Queensland government, which has most say in whether a single desk is retained, is on record as saying that it supports the single desk, and that is in spite of what the Senate might do. I will read to you from a letter from the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Perrett. It is very up to date; it is dated 21 November 1997. He replies to the member for Mirani as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Malone,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your inquiries concerning the Government's and my position with regard to the retention of single desk selling of raw sugar. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9391"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the Sugar Industry Review Working Party's package of recommendations was  endorsed by the Queensland and Commonwealth governments on 16 December 1996 and 4 March 1997 respectively. It recommended the retention of single desk selling of Queensland produced raw sugar by the reconstituted Queensland Sugar Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he goes on to talk about the numbers of the recommendations. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no grounds to believe that the Government's or my personal support for the retention of single desk selling has in any way diminished in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says that, despite the debate and despite the threat that the sugar tariff could be restored. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have consistently made public announcements to the effect that the retention of the system is assured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that you and your constituents can be assured that there is no policy change or likely to be any attempts to change that policy in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trevor J Perrett</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister for Primary Industries</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much for the argument that retaining the sugar tariff threatens the single desk selling. I think that Mr Perrett, in that particular regard, can be trusted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument used is that, if we restore the tariff, this will affect the merger between CSR Sugar and Mackay Sugar. The Democrats agree that that merger is a good thing. It should go ahead. It is good for the industry. It is certainly good for the sugar refining industry, which is in some trouble. There is no reason why that merger should be threatened by the restoration of a tariff. In fact, it is very interesting that, when the merger proposal was taken to the ACCC to get some assurances from them, they said that they were prepared to let the merger go ahead if the tariff was scrapped because the environment in Australia would be more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? I will tell you what it means. When they talk about the industry being more competitive, that is a code for cheap imports. That is a code for the price of sugar going down. That is code for all the things we have seen happen to other primary industries when successive Australian govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments have removed tariffs too fast and too early. Look at citrus, pork and tobacco. In an appendix to the committee's report, the ACCC&mdash;I hope that sugar farmers take note of this&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of high capacity refineries have been, or are being constructed, within the Middle East and Asia. The presence of such high capacity refineries creates the potential to displace other sources of refined sugar, thereby forcing existing suppliers to seek out replacement markets. This may result in an increased threat of imports for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not Labor scaremongering; that is not the Democrats scaremongering; that is what the ACCC said in its appendix to the report. I had not seen that appendix until the government included it. Thank you, government, for doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Refined sugar prices in international markets are forecast to remain low due to the increase in world refining capacity, together with an increase in refined sugar availability from the beet growing nations of Europe and from India and Brazil. That is the future for our sugar farmers. But do not take my word for it, and do not even take the word of the ACCC. Take the word of the biggest European sugar producers association&mdash;the World Association of Beet and Cane Growers, which was recently interviewed by an Australian journalist and asked what it thought of Australians dumping our sugar tariff this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report says that European growers are shielded by high government protection and dogged by Australian efficiency. What does the Secretary of the World Association of Beet and Cane Growers, Mike Garrod, an English sugarbeet grower, think about Australia scrapping the sugar tariff? Mr Garrod says that Australians are already the cheapest producers of sugar in the world and that it is best placed to compete. He says that we are already world competitive. His son Ian says that if protection of the European beet industry were scrapped, the industry would go under. This English beet farmer says, `If we had to compete at world market prices we'd be wiped out.' I can tell you that the Europeans are going to make sure their sugarbeet farmers survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to his father, Mike, who says that if the roles were reversed and the European 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9392"> Union allowed Australian sugar to come in duty free, the European producers would be  wiped out. Mr Garrod says that Australian sugar is so cheap the Europeans could not compete. Our farmers are so efficient and, even with the very minimum tariff that they have, are able to threaten the European Union with its high tariffs. Yet we are going to take away from them this very small tariff. I think that Australian cane farmers should do to this government what it deserves. I will wait for the next election because I think that that is when they are going to do it. The Australian government has removed the last little bit of protection of domestic sugar to open the floodgates to cheap imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry and the government also tell us that farmers support the government. I was told this so many times that I decided to do a survey. The Australian Cane Farmers Association, the voluntary body, provided me with the names and addresses of 5,000 cane farmers. The return on that survey was 15 per cent a couple of weeks ago, and since then I have received many more returns. The result of that survey shows that slightly over 90 per cent of those who responded wanted to keep the tariff. So much for the claim that there was support for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that Senator Forshaw read the promises of the Liberal and National Party government of the last election. It is worth repeating what was said.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, we as National Party politicians and candidates affirm that we are committed to oppose any additional cuts in the sugar tariff that are not accompanied by the implementation of measures that will reduce the costs of the sugar industry and make it better able to withstand the corruption of its international rivals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will promote the interests of the sugar industry at every opportunity so as to ensure the long-term prosperity of growers, millers and workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much for promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Forshaw has said, this bill contains other measures besides the sugar tariff measure. We sent a letter a couple of weeks ago to the government offering to separate the sugar tariff issue so that we could support the other issues. But I have not even had a reply to that letter. We will be supporting the Labor amendment on this when we come to the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have run this campaign to restore the tariff on sugar on principle. It just is not on for the Howard government to turn around and say, `We will scrap our tariff policy on cars and we will scrap our tariff policy on textiles but, because the backbenchers from Queensland aren't too powerful and there are only a couple of thousands of jobs at stake, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9393"> we will stick to our guns on sugar.' It is not on when the sugar industry agreed to let the tariff go only on the undertaking that there  would be uniform tariff reduction across the board. That did not happen. The government backed down and kept the tariffs on cars, textiles, clothing and footwear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cane Growers spokesman Ian Ballantyne delights in throwing around vague comments about the Democrats having our facts wrong on the tariff. I do not want to bag the cane growers; I think they may pay a price for their&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to hear what you are saying, Senator, but I am not sure that it is going to add anything to the debate. I do not want to sink the boot into the canegrowers. I understand that they are between a rock and a hard place. But I will put the facts straight. Mr Ballantyne takes issue with our claim that the removal of the tariff will reduce the average cane farmer's income by between $2,000 and $3,000 a year. He says that that is wrong. We got the figures from ABARE. We also confirmed the figures with the Chief Economist of the Australian Sugar Milling Council, Mr Demarchelier, who recently sent me written confirmation that he estimated the average cane farmer would lose around $2,600 a year through loss of the tariff. I want that straight. I want this debate to be about the facts, not furphies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I turn to the politics. It is well known that regional seats will win or lose the next federal election, particularly in Queensland. It would be political suicide for any state or federal government to scrap the single desk selling mechanism. I do not believe that any government would want to commit to that. However, I do believe that when the vote on this bill is known, a number of National Party seats will certainly be at risk. That is what their people are telling me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now I turn to Senator Bob Brown's intention, I understand, to vote down the tariff&mdash;that is, to vote with the government. I appeal to him even at this late stage to change his mind on that. The sugar tariff is not an environment issue. Not one extra centimetre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of land will be allocated for cane assignment through retention of the tariff, but millions of dollars worth of savings will go into the pockets of multinational soft drink manufacturers such as Coca-Cola at the expense of cane farmers and at the expense of the communities which support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder at the consistency of Senator Brown's stance. I would like to see him vote to reduce car tariffs on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles or vote against textile tariffs on the basis of sweated labour. I really do not agree with him. I appeal to Senator Brown to vote with Labor and the Democrats on this issue. It is not an issue about the environment; it is an issue about supporting Australian farming communities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a complicated issue. I have put a lot of work into it over the last few weeks. I appreciate the assistance I have been given in that work by representatives of grower organisations, business and conservation interests. The heart of the issue, as other speakers have said, and as it was presented to me very early on, is an apparent trade between the single desk selling system and the 15 per cent or so tariff which the government had removed regardless of this legislation. I will explain this to the Senate. The legislation as I see it is largely about validating the removal of that tariff: it brings it into law. But the government has the wherewithal to remove the tariff anyway, and did so in the middle of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the single desk selling system is a system by which every farmer gets the same price for the sugar that is produced. Sugar, unlike other agricultural products, is much the same no matter which farm it comes from. In that sense it is different from wool and apples in that sugar is sugar is sugar&mdash;the quality does not vary greatly and the purposes to which it can be put are exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in working through this very complicated situation, it became apparent to me, as the earlier speakers have said, that it was not a trade-off between the tariff and the single desk selling system. The two things were not linked. No-one, including the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9394"> government, could produce evidence that if one went, the other stayed, or vice versa. It was put to me at one stage that not even if  there was a potential threat from the World Trade Organisation would there be intervention if the tariff went and a single desk selling system remained or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that was constant, however, and united all interests in the cane growing field is that retention of the single desk selling system. Everybody agrees that it is a good system, everybody agrees that it is fair, everybody agrees that it benefits all cane growers and everybody fears that if it were to be removed, it could lead to a price war up and down the coast, which would be to the ultimate detriment of all concerned. It could even lead to different sugarcane millers having to employ people to go out and try to undercut other millers in the market place, not only here but overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering that some 85 per cent of  Australia's sugar is sold on the overseas market and is not affected by the domestic tariff. What is affected by having a tariff of about 15 per cent or $55 a tonne is the domestic price of sugar. It puts it up. This ostensibly means a better price for the cane growers for that 15 per cent of the sugar which is sold in Australia. That in itself has some untoward effects. It means that producers such as Cadbury's in my home state of Tasmania would pay a higher price for sugar than they would if the tariff were to remain abolished. Whether or not that is the case, Cadbury's submits that it is worth $750,000 a year to them not to have the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in following that up, I was not able to find that it would necessarily lead to a drop in the price of chocolates for the consumers out there who might be waiting for that if the tariff were to be permanently abolished. It will mean some rearrangement of the positioning of companies such as Cadbury's, which uses a lot of chocolate, as against producers of other foods. It might give them an advantage in that they will be able to have some price reductions somewhere along the line. That is a moot point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not appear that it is going to help protect chocolate producers, for example, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from international competition. However, there is an argument that other farmers are paying a subsidy to sugar growers when there is a tariff in place; and that, for example, people whose produce goes into the canning of fruits, which uses quite a bit of sugar, are having to pay higher prices for sugar. This disadvantages them against very big imports of canned fruit, jams and other produce. So the argument was that having the tariff advantaged cane growers but producers elsewhere in the country would be disadvantaged because their processed product would be sold at a higher price on the market because of the added expense of sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is more complicated than that, but I do not wish to go into it further because I do not have the time. However, farmers were split on the issue. I was lobbied by both groups&mdash;the Australian Cane Farmers Association as against the statutory organisation, the Australian Cane Growers Association&mdash;with both taking opposite points of view. As I said earlier, the one thing that united them, however, was the single desk selling system being retained. They were split on whether the tariff should remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked at the environment because, unlike Senator Woodley, I am aware that cane growing has an immense impact on the environment. It is not necessarily a positive impact. The rapid expansion of some 400,000 hectares in the cane growing area in Queensland in the last five years has had major impacts on the natural environment. I can name some of those. It has resulted in pre&hyphen;emptive clearing before assignment to sugar growers for expansion of their output has occurred. It has led to the clearing and filling of wetlands. It has led to the clearing of creek banks&mdash;that is, no riparian strips have been protected but there has been clearing right to creeks, with obvious impacts on creeks and the ecosystems of the waterways. There has been planting in marginal areas, usually inter&hyphen;tidal areas, with acid sulfate problems. We have seen those problems with the tourist development at Hinchinbrook. This acid sulfate problem has occurred where cane growers have moved to clear land below five metres above sea level.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9395">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been great concern about the use of pesticides on cane farms and about the soil erosion impact of this rapid expansion. I was  in the Ayr&hyphen;Home Hill area a few years ago and I saw the loss of woodlands in that region consequent upon state and federal government subsidised irrigation, but what pulled me up very rapidly with this expansion of cane growing was the absolute absence of an environmental assessment beforehand. I was told by experts in the field that there were rare and endangered orchids and butterflies in those woodlands and nothing was being done to assess their status. Certainly areas were not being protected to ensure their status but this rapid clearing was occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time I felt that governments were extraordinarily remiss to be giving assistance to an industry which had not got its environmental act in order. I am not aware of any environmental authority anywhere in the country that will say the cane growing industry has its environmental house in order. It simply has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The threat to more well&hyphen;known rare and endangered species like the mahogany glider and the cassowary&mdash;extraordinarily important parts of Australian wildlife heritage&mdash;is simply only the tip of the iceberg as endangered ecosystems and species, both plant and animal, are faced with the rapid expansion. There is likely to be another 400,000 hectares or so of expansion if the trends of the last five years are to extend for the next five years as far as this so far buoyant industry is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think it is quite remiss of anybody, including Senator Woodley from the Democrats, to say we have no environmental considerations in discussion of this legislation. What is the other appropriate time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Similarly, the Australian Cane Farmers Association said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unique, comprehensive and achievable were some of the words used by the ACFA Executive and Directors in describing the SIWRP report details that were released by Minister Trevor Perrett this week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The only two organisations representing all Queensland canegrowers called on the government to support the whole industry package and implement it. In fact, after that, those two people, Harry Bonanno and Ron Verri, came down here and called a meeting of all the people in the coalition who were interested in sugar and its representation, including Senate representatives, and said, `Support the report.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry representations to politicians were to support the report and all its 74 recommendations because that was what the industry wanted. That is what the government did&mdash;it listened to the industry and took this action to remove the tariff as from 1 July 1997, the main recommendation under direct Commonwealth responsibility. Recommendation 2.1 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tariff on raw and refined sugar and related products, as set out in chapter 17 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, should be removed with effect from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In complying with this recommendation, on 4 March primary industries minister, John Anderson, announced the government's decision to endorse the review's recommendations, including the removal of the tariff from 1 July 1997. On 26 March, the then minister for customs, Geoff Prosser, tabled the tariff 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal No. 2, which implemented the removal of customs duty from sugar molasses and treacle from 1 July 1997. This legislation is the legislation that must follow that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highly reviewed sugar industry hoped that the SIWRP package would put an end to the industry's continual review. But there have been two further inquiries. Firstly, the sugar task force, set up by the government, on the US quota and bulk terminals, which is to be released soon. The second inquiry was the reference of this bill to a Senate committee in September by the Democrats; the report was tabled last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the unanimous support in the SIWRP for the removal of the tariff, the terms of reference of the Senate inquiry opened up the tariff issue again. As a result of the latest Senate inquiry, the Democrats have jumped on their own political bandwagon, seeking cheap political mileage based on their own ignorance of the sugar industry and rural industry in general. They were quick to write to all growers about restoring the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the industry has seen the Democrats for what they are. And, I might add, the Democrats are a party that would destroy rural Australia with their anti-rural policies of wealth tax and inheritance tax, voting to ban live sheep exports, allowing permits to keep dingos, the prevention of fattening cattle in feedlots, and the end of kangaroo culling&mdash;not to mention their opposition to the 10&hyphen;point plan on the Wik native title that is so necessary for the existence of Australian primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting the response from one canegrowers' organisation, which told Senator Woodley that his `"survey" is shallow' and `naive'. It went on to say that the Democrats' letter `does not present a balanced argument nor does it address the issues relating to the removal or otherwise of the sugar tariff'. I seek leave to table that letter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Democrats, the industry has stuck with their decision to remove the tariff, and they recognise 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9399"> the benefits presented for future growth both in the industry and in world trade. Despite his earlier glowing endorsement of the SIWRP report, it was disappointing to read the same John Allison, General Manager of ACFA, say on 17 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACFA has corrected the perception the cane farmers were in total agreement with the recommendations made by the SIWRP.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was repeated by ACFA Chairman, Warren Martin, on 12 September, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian cane growers are extremely disappointed in the expedient, insidious and uninformed manner in which the federal government supported the removal of the sugar tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be remembered it was the industry that conducted its review and made its recommendations&mdash;and it was the united industry that told government to support and respect the industry decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest Senate committee majority report found that dispute over the impact of the removal of the tariff on cane growers has resulted in two important factors being made clear to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; a clear connection between the tariff removal and agreement for the retention of single desk selling of Australian raw sugar, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; that the level of the tariff has for some time been a component for fixing a price which cane growers will receive for sugar sold into the Australian domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further factor was that the removal of the tariff was paramount in the decision of the ACCC to reverse their opposition to the merger of the two refineries of CSR and Mackay Sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further recommendation was for the federal minister for primary industries to hold discussions with the Queensland government for consideration of possible implementation of notional import parity pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommended the introduction of export parity pricing from 1 July this year, which the Queensland government complied with and introduced on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there have been calls from the industry for import parity pricing, and I believe, as long as this would not diminish the strength of the industry's working party report in the crucial area of single desk selling, the federal and state governments would support this committee recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NCC clarification would be needed. However, Mrs Smith from the ACCC has already told the commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tee that notional import parity pricing would not be anti-competitive and that this would be the price paid by refiners in a free market for sugar.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The sugar tariff is something that I have been involved with since its inception. In December 1988, when the embargo was removed and the Labor government proposed an ad valorem tariff reducing to 15 per cent by mid-1992, I moved a motion in the Senate that called for the investigation of the need for a tariff in the circumstances of the then corrupt world market. I believed that a tariff was necessary to prevent the corrupted world price for sugar being imported into Australia as the domestic price. This was at a time of massive subsidies to producers in the EU, the US and Thailand, and high tariff barriers with no world trade agreement to control the resultant price and trade distortions. The final result of the Senate inquiry was that the Labor government implemented a tariff of $115 per tonne on raw and refined sugar, reducing to $95 per tonne until July 1992, and $70 per tonne thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, 10 months later the Labor government tried to change the rules and accelerate the tariff down from the agreed $70 a tonne to $55 a tonne. Senator O'Chee and some of the other National Party senators crossed the floor to support the industry. It was the Labor Party's wish at the time. That makes it an absolute hypocrisy that the Labor Party now oppose the reduction of the tariff when in opposition&mdash;against the wishes of the peak industry body. When they were in government they removed the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the tariff was introduced, many things have changed. Firstly, of course, the industry, through their review, has asked for the removal of the tariffs in the best future interests of the industry. But of enormous significance is the resolution of the Uruguay Round in 1995 and the freeing&hyphen;up of world trade. As a result of the Uruguay Round, set reductions in subsidies have been introduced under the terms of the world trade agreement and the lowering of tariffs amongst our main customers and competitors. With sugar the evidence is there to see; it is already happening. As a direct result of the reforms in world trade, there have been increased export opportuni 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9400"> ties. At the same time, the opening up of the Australian industry has seen a 60 per cent increase in production over the last 10 years, compared to 10 per cent elsewhere. The value of cane to Australian farmers has increased by 144 per cent over the last eight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the opening up of world trade as a result of the Uruguay Round and the WTO, we now have the majority of our sugar markets with a sugar tariff of zero to five per  cent. Sixty per cent of our sugar goes to Canada, Malaysia, Korea, New Zealand and Singapore&mdash;all on a zero tariff, other than Korea with a five per cent tariff. It is true that tariff levels are still unacceptably high in our competitors, but subsidies have come down 12 per cent in the EU and 20 per cent in the US and are scheduled for further reductions. Australia and the Cairns Group put agriculture on the world trade agenda for the very first time in the Uruguay Round and have ensured a further review of agricultural protection in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence is manifest that Australian raw sugar exports have expanded as a direct result of tariff reductions. There are concrete market gains in our major export markets. In Japan the tariff has gone down from 44 yen a kilo to 15 yen, with sales increases of 19 per cent, from 696,000 metric tonnes to 827,000 metric tonnes over the past four years. The tariff in Korea has fallen from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and exports have increased from 516,000 metric tonnes to 769,000. In Egypt the tariff went from 20 per cent to 5 per cent and Australian exports rose from zero in 1989 to 127,000 metric tonnes in 1994. In Indonesia tariffs have fallen to zero from 10 per cent, opening up exports from zero to 42,000 metric tonnes. In India tariffs have gone from 80 per cent to 50 per cent and sales have gone from zero to 5,000 metric tonnes. And recent sales into places like Bulgaria, Russia and the Middle East flow from tariffs of 5 per cent or zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a major trading nation. The sugar industry exports 85 per cent&mdash;soon to be 90 per cent&mdash;of its crop. In agriculture generally, only one in five farmers is needed to produce for the domestic market. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sugar industry, it would be one in nine. As a major exporting country, we have the most to gain from the opening up by other countries of their markets. Our tariff only benefits the 10 to 15 per cent going to the domestic market, whereas the only growth available to Australian cane farmers is from the export opportunities for the other 90 per cent. All Australian rural industries either have a zero or a five per cent tariff. This occurred this decade under the Labor government's tariff reductions. The sugar tariff does hurt these same industries that have no tariff protection and are facing imports. They do not enjoy the 85 per cent export markets of the sugar industry but must remain competitive to remain viable and provide Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one is a greater supporter of the Queensland sugar industry than I am, and I will continue to support and be proud of the highly efficient, world competitive industry that has been created. But future decisions have to be the right decisions to enable the industry to continue to prosper and grow through the only way possible&mdash;the export market. History has proven that a divided industry does not thrive; past unity has ensured the industry's success and progress. The industry has had strong, committed and far&hyphen;sighted leadership, and giant strides have occurred since the industry undertook its reform program this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined industry had the sustained future of the industry in mind when it unanimously endorsed its 74 recommendations, including the removal of the tariff. The achievements and future directions of the industry are contained in the words of the canegrowers' press release last December in support of the review findings. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good news for growers is that it retains the strengths of our current production and marketing arrangements which have made us one of the world's most efficient, productive and least assisted sugar industries, while providing opportunities for greater flexibility, innovation and local control.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I say to the canegrowers that it is unrealistic for you to try to have us get people to reduce the tariffs that allow your sugar to flow into new international markets while we retain ours. I support the bill because it is the right thing for the industry, and the industry initial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9401"> ly asked us to do it. The representatives of the industry came down and sought a meeting with Senator O'Chee, me, Larry Anthony and all those that were interested and represented sugar seats. They told us at the time, `We are convinced that in the best interests of the sugar industry the tariff should be removed, so we will not be seeing any other committees, and we are happy if the tariff goes.' That is their word that I took, and I support the bill. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S111">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  [No. 3] covers essentially three issues. The first issue concerns some basic changes to treatment of electronic components, and this is not contentious, as far as I know. The second is the revenge on Canadian petrochemical provisions. Since the third is the sugar issue, where government wants to drop our tariffs to zero, it is worth considering that the Canadian revenge measure is being launched because the deal with the Canadians was for them to have lower tariffs for our sugar and for us to have lower tariffs for their petrochemicals. The Canadians have not raised their sugar tariffs at all&mdash;they have just offered other nations a chance to have the same low tariffs. We are taking revenge for this because it means we export less sugar to Canada.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here at home, however, we are quite happy to ignore the sugar industry; there is no apparent gain. What do we get from reducing sugar tariffs? I know that Cadbury and Coke will get a better profit margin since they have said that they will not lower their prices. But this does not mean that there will be any jobs, increase in production or reinvestment of those profits in Australia. These confectionary and soft drink companies are big transnational corporations and their investment strategies are not bound to national considerations. They will invest where it makes the most sense for them. So, there is no apparent gain to anyone except maybe consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sugar currently costs about 37c per kilo or $370 per tonne on the spot commodity market. The tariff adds 5c per kilo to that cost, bringing it to around 42c per kilo. So for a consumer who pays 1&half; times more for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> packaging, distribution and marketing of sugar than for the sugar itself, the price of sugar might go from something like $1.06 to $1.01 if the tariff was removed. It might go down by 5c but I would not bet on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that, assuming chocolate is 25 per cent sugar, the value of the sugar in a 250g block of chocolate is about 10c. Reducing the tariff might drop the cost by 1c. A 250g block of chocolate sells in supermarkets for between $2.50 on sale and about $3 at normal price. If a chocolate bar is less than one&hyphen;quarter sugar by weight, the significance of the cost differential in sugar is less. Likewise, in soft drinks or other goods the cost differential in the sugar component for the consumer is so small it is entirely swamped by normal store to store variation. Cost of sugar is not a consumer issue. The only people for whom it makes a difference are bulk buyers, such as confectioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So very few people stand to win if the sugar tariff goes&mdash;mind you, I have seen how much sugar goes into cool drinks; it might make a difference there. On the other hand, we would be likely to see imports coming in from other nations in our region&mdash;Thailand, India and China&mdash;as well as from more traditional sources such as Malaysia, the EEC and Brazil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who would loose? The canegrowers would lose. There are a fair number of them spread up the coast from northern New South Wales. The argument I have heard is that imports would be negligible because the local farmers would just decrease their prices. Unfortunately, reducing prices, where possible, means reducing the profitability of the farm. It is worth noting that those prices may be slightly higher domestically but it is important for them to be kept down on exports. Under pressure economically it would probably mean the growers would try to get by with fewer employees and fewer purchases so workers would lose and small and medium rural towns and cities would lose. Anyone farming in a marginal agricultural area, just starting out or vulnerable to change would possibly loose their farm.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9402">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia would lose in trade terms. Sure, we would get to boast about being free traders&mdash;yet again&mdash;but it would have given away any rationale for expecting other nations to lower their tariffs in the future, and we export far more sugar than we use. The EEC has a $797 tariff, the USA has a $506 tariff on above&hyphen;quota imports and Thailand has a $332 tariff. Our $55 tariff is already low. There is no requirement under the World Trade Organisation to reduce it to zero. This is entirely the bright idea of our free&hyphen;marketeers. It is ironic that this occurs in the same  bill where we penalise Canada for lowering their tariffs to other selected nations instead of to just us. Isn't that amazing? I am surprised the government was not more consistent and just lowered the tariff on petrochemicals for everyone instead of just eliminating Canadian preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take this opportunity to reiterate that, although I often oppose tariff reduction in this place, the Greens (WA) are not protectionist. We oppose unregulated free trade and would like to see some measure of international if not global regulation to prevent trade advantages built on oppression and exploitation of people and the environment. The scrupulous and well intentioned cannot easily or fairly compete with the exploitative. As several industry groups have pointed out, regulation means everyone must compete on equal grounds. Otherwise, those with a conscience are disadvantaged. If it was not that way, crime, exploitation and so on would not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We favour fair trade where there are measures in place to ensure that the cost of environmental protection and social justice is included in the price of a good. We also favour managed trade, where blocs decide to trade goods of roughly equal value between them so that trade does not result in debt. Development in any practical terms is about creating a better world, and materially about creating wealth through more intelligent use of effort and material. It is not about importing huge amounts of goods and capital and going into debt while depriving one's own citizens of the ability to work. If there is anything valuable about the idea of competi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive advantage in international trade it must be premised on roughly equal trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for me there are several issues so far. The only real advantage to dropping the tariff goes to big confectionary manufacturers. There are some potential drawbacks for rural communities and farmers. There are drawbacks in moving unilaterally to free trade, both in terms of any leverage to get any other nation to lower tariff barriers and in terms of moving towards a regulated fair market system instead of towards a free market, which will provide advantages to exploitation and will economically penalise any nation that acts responsibly towards its environment or its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are basic arguments. There are some specific issues in relation to the sugar industry, however. Sugar is not an environmentally benign product and I will focus on that aspect later as, I am sure, will other senators. It is not a particularly benign product in terms of health, and as a society we eat far too much sugar. Sugar is put into far too many foods where it is not really required as an ingredient. In this case, we have Canegrowers, the peak organisation, supporting the government in eliminating the tariffs. We also have many of their members and smaller canegrower organisations fighting both the government and their own peak lobby organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a certain amount of fear generated about the possibility of eliminating the single desk or making it less effective. We have seen National Party parliamentarians in the House of Representatives cross the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will start with the last issue first. The single desk is an institution which has broad support from all sides of Queensland politics. Despite rumours, the ACCC has no intention of looking at it, and the National Consumer Council has no power to do so. In spite of any division in the ranks of canegrowers in regard to the tariff, there is no good division whatsoever on single desk selling in the domestic market. I do not think that is at risk. I do not actually believe it is an issue for this debate. I think if it was, you would find Nationals crossing the floor&mdash;I was going to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9403"> say in large numbers, but in whatever numbers they could muster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also point out that the single desk is at least something like what the developing world asked for in the NIEO resolution in the United Nations. It allows some sense of growers working together and getting a fair return, rather than being set against each other by much more powerful distribution companies, in order to drive prices&mdash;to the distributor, not the customer&mdash;down. It also involves some sense of what is actually required rather than pushing for more and more production to the detriment of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the difficult issue of environmental impacts. Senator Brown's second reading amendment seeks to affirm the Senate's support for a single desk and the Senate's belief that the conditions for an assignment grant under the Queensland government, which require that land be suitable for environmentally sustainable sugar production, are good conditions and should be followed. I think this is practical, and I will be supporting Senator Brown's amendment on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental consequences of maintaining the tariff, or of removing it, are not easy to determine because there is no direct link. On one hand, the retention of tariffs can be something that results in further expansion of the industry, which may be problematic because so many environmental problems are associated with poorly considered expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the reduction of tariffs can have negative effects in terms of land care. Where a farmer is having a hard time economically and the choice is between doing the right thing in looking after the land and the environment or making enough money to pay the mortgage or other bills, they would often opt for the mortgage. It seems to make more sense to most farmers to have a degraded farm under environmental pressure than to have no farm at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical factors in land care has always been the ability of farmers to have some economic margin. More often than not, poor land care practice is not the result of a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lack of understanding. It is dubious as to whether the impact will be good or bad and, of course, economic pressure can come from a number of sources: the farming of land with marginal soil, the impact of drought, flood and climate change, fluctuations on the commodities market and new planting overseas coming on&hyphen;line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, clearing of land is not necessarily tied to expanding markets. Something like the Sugar Industry Infrastructure Project&mdash;SIIP&mdash;can result in continuing expansion whether or not there are commercial problems in the industry. So nothing is clear cut except that there are some very bad environmental impacts from current sugar industry activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will put an amendment to try to address the environmental effects, and I will speak at greater length about the problems my amendment seeks to address when I put that amendment. In the meantime, I will bring in a final consideration that has entered my decision on this bill, which is that this is a one&hyphen;way process. If the tariff remains, it will always be possible to eliminate it, and I imagine there will be future attempts to do so. If the tariff is removed now there will never be a return to it, no matter what problems may arise subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of making a good decision, I think there are too many questions to be certain that this is in fact a good thing. If those questions are later answered, the results may be different but, this time, the issue is quite divided. There appear to be very few benefits to the general community as a result of the government's removal of tariffs. There appear to be definite problems and drawbacks. There appear to be no certain positive environmental consequences with either option, and potential drawbacks with either option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, it moves us further in the direction of unregulated free trade. This will have the effect of eroding all measures to protect the environment or community if such measures impose any cost to business. This is a factor which will erode such measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the rapidly expanding producer nations, such as India and Thailand, are expanding with virtually no consideration for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9404"> the environment or people. Villagers are being `relocated', often forcibly. Other villages are being devastated as sugar farming results in drawdown of ground water in states such as Maharashtra, with the result that communal wells go dry. Herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers, some of which are illegal in OECD nations, are being dumped by chemical companies in these nations, and they are using them without adequate health or environmental training, with devastating consequences for water, land, environment and, of course, for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sugar use is far more intensive than traditional agriculture, and yet these countries are seizing on the option for cash crops and pillaging the land. In a decade or so, we will  see these lands stripped of all nutrients and poisoned. But, remember, this is the kind of thing that is encouraged under world free trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is part of the pattern of this particular bill; one of the outcomes. We can talk of Australia being a small market, but we are adding to the demand trend, and that will be multiplied in growth curves projected to continue. Planting will be done on the basis of these projections. When the market is saturated, nations like India will seek to sell anyway. They cannot afford to have such a commitment go unrealised. Sugar prices will drop, and they will be in dire straits economically. This is not a new pattern, but one that has gone on for the last several decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not be labouring these points, although I have a body of information to which I can point interested senators. I will simply say that this issue of free trade resulting in social and environmental degradation elsewhere is real. It is also real that once these things occur, we see pressure to deny all sorts of rights and benefits and environmental protection in the interest of international competitiveness. That particular phrase has been used to deny everything from environmental protection to native title to industry awards. So, on balance, I will not be supporting the government on this issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak tonight, firstly I acknowledge the Ngunnawal people, the traditional owners of the land on which this building stands, and, in recognising them and offering my respects, I draw the attention of all in this place to our special responsibility for and on behalf of them and for all of Australia's indigenous people. This debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , a bill of fundamental concern to them, is taking place without a single indigenous Australian sitting here with a voice and a vote. As the political representatives of all Australians, we are responsible for ensuring that such voices are heard with sensitivity and with respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, a great majority of Australians, excluding a handful of conservative politicians and their morally bankrupt leader, were willing to step out together on the road to reconciliation. They confronted the truth of our shared past. They reflected with deep sorrow on the dispossession visited on our indigenous peoples. They heard of neglect and of discrimination. Worse still, they heard the stories of families torn apart and of the systematic destruction of the fundamental structures of a rich and ancient culture. The individual stories of abandonment and despair touched the heart of this nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledged these truths in our history and we said we were sorry, and we are sorry for that history, but now we are in the business of making history. We are not looking from a distance at the mistakes of our forebears. We are making choices&mdash;choices that we expect our children to live with. We know what we have to do. We know the consequences of ignorance, small&hyphen;mindedness, selfishness and blinkered attitudes. How will history judge us? Do we think it is sufficient that we can leave it to our children to revisit our mistakes in 20 years time and then again say sorry? If we fail to act justly, it will not be a matter of sorrow; it will be a matter of collective shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must have a view of the problems that this bill seeks to address that is not clouded by prejudice, by sectional interests or by a wish to conceal or deny and, just as surely, we must not invent problems and then invent devices to deal with them. Native title is not a problem. It is a source of national pride. For indigenous Australians, it affirms their culture, it affirms their traditions and it affirms their very sense of being. For all Australians, it affirms the justness of our law. In confirming the ancient law of our indigenous peoples and the native title that emerges through that law, we affirm justice for all. Let me just repeat those last three words&mdash;justice for all&mdash;not for one race, not for the wealthy and powerful but for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that we proceed from an acceptance of truth&mdash;an acceptance of the truth of our history and an acceptance of the truth of our real circumstances. This goes to the heart of matters that will bring us directly in dispute with the government over this bill. This bill represents a series of great Liberal lies. They are lies of a moral, political and constitutional nature. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that his 10&hyphen;point plan would deliver certainty yet the bill is probably unconstitutional and, as a result, will see native title cases in the High Court for years and in federal courts for decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister promised that the bill would respect the rights of all Australians, but the uncontested and uncontestable legal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9406"> advice is that this bill is racially discriminatory. In the words of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), it delivers `bucketfuls of extinguishment'. The Prime Minister and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, have said that this bill does nothing more than enact the common law. Yet this bill goes way beyond Mabo and Wik; it goes way beyond those decisions by depriving indigenous Australians of their property rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission said that the bill, rather than being about the protection and enhancement of native title, should be described as `a pastoral lease enhancement measure'. In some respects, I think this is an unfair description. It is unfair in the way that it purports to represent the interests of many pastoralists. Most pastoralists simply seek to get on with their lives within a framework of legal simplicity and certainty. But the commission's description is an accurate description of what this government has sought to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the history of native title. The Mabo decision corrected the great lie upon which this nation had been built. For over 200 years, through the application of the doctrine of terra nullius, Australian law had sought to hide the fact that we were not the first inhabitants of this land. Our law sought to pretend that the indigenous Australians did not have cultures that dealt with issues of land management, nor did the law seek to understand the very special spiritual and cultural attachment of indigenous Australians to this land&mdash;their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mabo was the first step in rectifying that blight on our national history. It is a pity that it took a court judgment to force us, as Australians and as legislators, to face up to this issue but ultimately we did and, in a historic compact reached in 1993, the parliament passed the Native Title Act, an act which respects and preserves native title yet allows reasonable use and development of the land to continue. The 1993 act is complex. As a result, it was inevitable that experience would show the need for amendments to the legislation and Labor has been&mdash;as is exemplified by the constructive amendments we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will move during the course of this debate&mdash;willing to support those necessary changes, but so, too, have indigenous Australians been conscious of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision has presented Australians with an even greater challenge. For the first time, we have been asked to confront the issues of coexistence of land rights. Rights to land is, of course, a very emotive subject. One only has to look at some of the major conflicts around the world to see that and the idea of different communities living side by side, let alone interwoven as contemplated by the principles of coexistence, is a great challenge indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, unlike the government, we in the Labor Party believe coexistence is a concept that the Australian people are mature enough to handle. After all, despite many of the bleaker moments in our national history, there have been rays of light where Australians, black and white, have learnt to come together on the land that we share. The debate on this bill is a debate about matters of highest principle but it is also a debate about achieving real coexistence for real people on real pieces of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the great lies I spoke about earlier on. While they may not be as stark and confronting as the notion of terra nullius, these lies are designed to have exactly the same effect. They are fictions, designed to prevent Australia from coming to terms with the truth of our history&mdash;not a black armband view of history nor one that wears a blindfold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first lie that must be confronted is that the Wik decision was a win for indigenous Australians at the expense of pastoralists. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Wik judgement confirmed that pastoralists can continue to do on their land what they have done for generations. To the extent that native title is found on pastoral leases, it is subservient to the interests of the pastoralists. To their great credit, and this needs to be placed on the record, indigenous leaders have indicated from the start that they are just as keen as the pastoralists to remove any doubt about the certainty of pastoralists' rights and their right 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9407"> to use the land. Such uncertainty serves no&hyphen;one's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get around what you would expect to be a relatively simple issue, this government has sought to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer, and it has sought to do so in a sneaky, underhand and unprincipled manner. The government has deliberately complicated its Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 to make it difficult for even the experts to understand the full extent of its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second lie put about by the government is perhaps its biggest. It claims that the government's package is fair and reasonable. The way the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) have sought to peddle this lie is by comparing this government's legislation with the extreme position of those who irresponsibly argue for the blanket extinguishment of native title. Although this extremist view has been abandoned by the government, albeit reluctantly, it is no benchmark against which to test the  legislation. This government, although it has not chosen blanket extinguishment, has chosen something which amounts to only sightly less than blanket extinguishment. To say the package is fair and reasonable because it does not achieve wholesale extinguishment is, I believe, a crude distortion of the meaning of those very well understood words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even the position that the government has reached in proposing this bill is fraught with danger. First, the undisputed evidence of constitutional and human rights experts is that this bill is a flagrant breach of Australia's international legal obligations. These same experts are almost unanimously of the view that the bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. The government claims to have legal advice to the contrary but it has been unwilling to test that advice in the public arena. Instead the government&mdash;and the Prime Minister in particular&mdash;has been unctuous in its criticism of those who claim that the government is acting in a racially discriminatory manner. The Prime Minister has argued that these claims are part of a gross and irresponsible smear campaign.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem the Prime Minister has is that people, including senior church leaders, have not levelled these accusations lightly. Contrary to the Prime Minister's perception and the perception he has sought to create, whether Australia is acting in a racially discriminatory manner is not a matter of subjective judgement or public opinion. The benchmarks are provided by the Racial Discrimination Act and the international legal obligations that underpin it, in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is against these criteria that Australia, Australians and&mdash;particularly&mdash;this Senate will be judged. It is against these criteria that the bill has already been judged by legal and human rights experts from Australia and from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, as we know, quite clearly has advice that this bill is racially discriminatory. It has chosen not to release that advice. We in the Senate will continue to seek that advice from Chief General Counsel Mr Henry Burmester on how this legislation breaches both the Racial Discrimination Act and our international legal obligations pursuant to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice is there, yet the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State have been pretending that there is no such thing. They cannot live with this lie any longer. In living with this lie they have misled the parliament and they have misled the people of Australia for long enough. They must now concede that this bill is discriminatory and must be amended. I hope it will be amended in this place, and I hope it will be amended in the way that the ALP proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will present some 359 amendments to the government's bill. All of them are aimed at making the ultimate result truly fair and reasonable, not just for pastoralists and miners but also for indigenous people and for the Australian people as a whole. In a very real way, all Australians are stakeholders in this debate. We all have an interest in ensuring a fair and reasonable outcome here, whether we live in urban or regional Australia or rural Australia, whether we are indigenous or non&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9408">indigenous, whether we have a direct interest in the outcome of this debate or no direct interest at all. All Australia has an interest in ensuring a fair, reasonable and non&hyphen;discriminatory outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third lie that has been put abroad by the government is that its bill is constitutionally valid and will provide legal certainty. There can be absolutely no doubt that this bill will result in long, protracted legal battles that will embroil all the shareholders for a long time. There can be no doubt now that this bill is of extremely doubtful constitutional validity. The government has had the benefit of the advice of a wide array of eminent lawyers who have given evidence before parliamentary committees on this matter. Their advice is powerful and convincing. The bill is said to be based principally on the races power, principally&mdash;section 51(xxxvi) of the constitution. As we have been able to elicit during the last few months, a government which bases its legislation on the races power will definitely find itself back in the courts for a long time&mdash;and in the highest courts of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's constitutional validity will ultimately be tested against the background of the 1967 referendum. The High Court will do so. That referendum gave parliament the power for the first time to make special laws for Aboriginal people. In the 1960s the government led by Sir Robert Menzies gave consideration to the means of providing the constitutional vehicle for allowing the Commonwealth to pass such laws. It advanced the referendum bill through parliament, on the basis that the power was to be used for the benefit of the Aboriginal race. To quote Prime Minister Harold Holt's second reading speech, `The government would regard it as desirable to secure the widest measure of agreement with respect to Aboriginal advancement.' The bill was passed unanimously by both houses, and it achieved a record 90.77 per cent support from the Australian public. The government now wants to pass legislation which is, unarguably, discriminatory against the indigenous people of this country and it wants to use this very same races power to do so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of the constitutional validity or the technical legalities involved in the interpretation of this bill, there is a very deep moral question involved. How can a government profess to base its law making powers on a purported ability to enact racially discriminatory laws? Not only is this a complete abandonment of the Racial Discrimination Act but it also flies directly in the face of Australia's commitment to international treaties like the one I mentioned earlier. It is downright unethical. During the last few months of scrutiny of the bill, other constitutional problems have been raised by experts. For instance, the bill does not provide just terms compensation, the terms required by the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the evil in this bill is in its detail. It is impossible to fathom its depths without painstaking research and a great deal of technical knowledge. The government has used the complexity of this bill as a tool. They have banked on the average person being incapable of coming to a fulsome understanding of what its true objectives are. In this way, they have attempted to push and to conceal their three big lies. They have attempted to swamp the opposition and minority parties with the minute detail of the legislation. But we have not been swamped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has developed a detailed and considered response to the bill, and we have developed our proposals after extensive consultation with all of the stakeholders. Unlike the government, we have listened to all sides and, unlike the government, we have aimed for procedural fairness and honest respect for indigenous rights and an equitable result for all parties. We have tried to get certainty through justice. We have produced a package which is a fair compromise in all of these circumstances. Not one group, of course, can expect to achieve all of their expectations on all of the issues. But we have produced a package of certainty, justice and fairness. We must all be fair. We must be mindful of the historic responsibility that we in this place bear on behalf of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever I say about some of the senators opposite, at least some of them have not been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9409"> hypocrites. Some have refused to join the reconciliation movement. They have refused to apologise for past injustice and they intend to vote for the government's bill. But what of those opposite who stand for reconciliation and who claim to at least acknowledge past injustice? I say to all of them: you will not get a better chance&mdash;and you may not get another chance&mdash;to act justly, prudently and wisely. I say to all of us in the Senate: let us use our wisdom and our compassion to grasp this great and passing chance to achieve reconciliation in this great nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  constitutes a very important and substantial commitment on the part of the coalition government to write sense and certainty into the Native Title Act. In doing so, the Special Minister of State, Senator Nick Minchin, will deliver real outcomes and tangible results in the form of a workable legislative framework to process native title claims for Aboriginal people and a land administration system geared to facilitate, not discourage, development. This bill is consistent with a raft of other measures in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs portfolio aimed at better improving the conditions and opportunities available to Aboriginal people, who were so poorly served by the previous Labor government. In fact, the outcomes of that government revealed a measurable decrease in services, effectiveness 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and general health standards for Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I and many of my colleagues predicted when the original native title legislation was before the Senate in 1993, the basic administration of the Native Title Act has proved to be cumbersome, costly and totally unworkable. Of the more than 600 claims currently before the Native Title Tribunal, only a single claim has been settled in four years. This is unacceptable and has only been exacerbated by the High Court's Wik decision which found, in essence, that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title. An obvious balance of interests has to be struck by legislative action. Such a balance is best achieved by a single overarching body of legislation as opposed to a system based on piecemeal litigation&mdash;Labor's preferred option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historically, the concept of native title has enjoyed the support of this parliament since `antecedent native title' was first proposed in 1988 as part of the founding ministerial statement for ATSIC by the former Minister Hand entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foundations for the Future</EMPHASIS>. I was concerned at that time that, should the federal government choose to legislate in this complex area, care should be taken to ensure the intention of the legislation was explicit. At the time I posed a series of questions in the Senate, asking on 27 April 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does the preamble purport to do? That must be spelt out in clear, precise terms. Further, what will be the effects on mining and industry? Are the proprietary rights of individuals or the Crown in relation to the rights of the States or a Territory affected and, if so, how? What are the constitutional ramifications? Will this improve the position of Aborigines or is the whole exercise merely a political exercise on the part of the Federal Government?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I commended the legal notion of native title as innovative; however, I warned that because such a concept as a native title right was not formally recognised by common law and had never been put into legislation before:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the consequences pertaining to land administration will flow through to the High Court, and that will create very dangerous precedents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was in April 1988&mdash;four years before the High Court's historic Mabo decision in which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9410"> a majority of six judges dismissed the common law notion of terra nullius in favour of the legal recognition of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the Keating government introduced the Native Title Bill in a bid to answer the host of questions left unresolved by the Mabo decision and to very properly legislate for certainty and predictability. As a senator for the Northern Territory, with over 25 per cent of my constituents being either Aboriginal or of Aboriginal descent, I took a keen interest in the passage of Labor's native title legislation. In my speech in the second reading debate on 15 December 1993, I acknowledged the special concerns expressed to me by Northern Territory residents that the legislation be drafted properly the first time to avoid what most anticipated to be an administrative system set for failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the concerns raised by my party colleagues about the seemingly small circle of sectional interests consulted by the Labor government when the legislation was drafted, the very general and ambiguous tenor of the legislation itself, and its divisive nature were dismissed by the Labor Party as they pushed the bill, ham&hyphen;fisted, through parliament to satisfy a political, not practical, imperative of  the Labor Party. As I said at the time, the legislation was fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Wik judgment of 23 December 1996, the High Court found that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title. The findings contradicted assurances given by then Prime Minister Keating, then Aboriginal Affairs Minister Tickner and Senator Gareth Evans on behalf of the Labor Party that the intention of the Native Title Act was that pastoral leases extinguish native title. As Senator Evans told the Senate on 18 December 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is overwhelmingly likely that when this comes to be formally decided the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases do in fact extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Bob Collins confirmed this intention on 21 January this year, when he told ABC radio:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all I know is that everything that we did previously was based on the assumption, publicly stated on many occasions from the Prime Minister down, that in the view of the Government, the then Government, native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. We now have a majority decision which has taken that judgement and it is contrary to the assumptions that we relied on when we were in Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Bob Collins again this morning on radio in Darwin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the facts are, and I don't know why people just don't stand up and say it, we were wrong as it happened, as I said by a margin of one judge. But you can't rewrite history.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor clearly have no credibility when it comes to native title and have demonstrated they are prepared to play the raw politics of the issue at any cost. Unfortunately, the main casualty of Labor's ineptitude is the broader Aboriginal community. Chief Justice Brennan, a tireless advocate for the Aboriginal cause and a key facilitator of the Mabo High Court judgment, foreshadowed the predicament we now face when he warned in his dissenting judgment in Wik:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too late now to develop a new theory of land law that would throw the whole structure of land titles based on Crown grants into confusion. Moreover, a new theory which undermines those doctrines would be productive of uncertainty having regard to the nature of native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  addresses this confusion and uncertainty, and will deliver a workable land administration system equipped to effectively process and administer land claims. I commend the government's second reading speech, the bill and our new amendments&mdash;particularly those announced today&mdash;for far-reaching detail. It is in all our interests, and especially those of our Aboriginal constituencies, to pass this bill and expedite the processing of the hundreds of claims backlogged in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of a system of Aboriginal land administration and recognition of the special circumstances of Aboriginal people is not new to Northern Territory residents who have lived with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for two decades. This act 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9411"> originally provided the facility to transfer freehold title land to Aboriginal people and subsequently set in place the administrative system necessary to manage Aboriginal land. To date, land claimed under the act comprises some 42 per cent&mdash;over 560,000 square kilometres&mdash;of the Northern Territory, with most other currently available land subject to claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The land rights act provides for an absolute veto on development and mining. In the 20 years this provision has been active, only one new mine and the expansion of another have occurred on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory&mdash;an appalling lack of development in some of the most resource rich areas of Australia. Once again, the main casualties are Aboriginal people, most of whom recognise the important links between economic and social self-determination, and the broader Australian community having development held to ransom. Thankfully, the Commonwealth government has recently decided to review the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and the political nature of land councils. I seek leave to have incorporated the terms of reference for Mr John Reeves QC and my initial response to that review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear John</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the invitation to participate in your review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I have noted your terms of reference and proposed program for review. I look forward to receiving your initial issues paper and will be pleased to comment in detail on that document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware I have taken a constant critical interest in the Northern Territory Land Councils during my 10&hyphen;year term (to date) in the Senate. I attach for your information <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  copies of various parliamentary statements by me which should be read in the historical context of the particular dates and political policies then prevailing (Attachment A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also enclose a chart detailing the distribution of funds from the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account (Attachment B). This chart is an invaluable reference against which to judge the effectiveness of benefits obtained from mining royalties by Aborigines in the Northern Territory since 1976. The figures shown are actual allocations for each financial year (totalling $387m) and when adjusted for inflation* would today be an equivalent expenditure of $490m for the 19 years. I am of the opinion that the administration allocations under S64(1) and S64(7) of $202km (equivalent 1997* = $252m) reveal an alarming paucity of measurable result for the land council functions, particularly when compared to any other statutory authority or public service administration. I would ask that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9412"> under your term of reference (iv) that an economic analysis and comparison be carefully undertaken. Similarly,  the access to funds of $183m (equivalent 1997* = $235m) for traditional owners (S64(3)) and community support (S64(4)) should also be subjected to a careful regional impact and benefit assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that I have commented in parliament on the transparency and effectiveness of the operations of royalty associations. (Your term of reference(v)). I am keen to discuss with you on a confidential basis a number of allegations that have been made to me over the years about the administration and use of royalty funds, which are very properly the property of Aboriginal communities and their residents. I am yet to be convinced that there is a proper exercise of fiduciary responsibility in this area or that there has been an appropriate investment strategy developed by the land councils/trustees for individual communities and clans/families in commercial and business opportunities. The extent of Aboriginal participation in joint venture capital projects is inadequate and can only lead to the assumption that a large proportion of the funding from S64(3), S64(4) and other sources has been irresponsibly dissipated and/or managed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know there are a plethora of political initiatives and previous inquiries which impact on your review, eg, the formation of ATSIC in 1988/89; the Walter and Turnbull and Auditor General audits and inquiries of 1992/93; and the Native Title and Indigenous Land Corporation legislation. Your review will be incomplete without an appraisal of these policy changes, and whether the land councils have responded appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of Northern Territory and Commonwealth Government departments and  agencies delivering services to Aboriginal communities which conflict with the activities of the land councils. You may like to note the attached summary of expenditure by Commonwealth departments in the Northern Territory (Attachment C&mdash;nb 1996/97 financial year). My office has available additional information from these budgets in areas of specific program activity and regional implications, if required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that the current process of Northern Territory Grants Commission distribution inadequately assesses the priorities and fairness between the many conflicting service&hyphen;delivery agencies and areas of land council overlap; particularly in light of the emergence and maturity of many Aboriginal leaders participation in local/community government, ATSIC Regional Councils and investment/infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various Aboriginal communities are concerned about the administration of permits to visit, or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reside, on Aboriginal land. This matter needs clarification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficult issues of revenue sources/income support and taxation equity affecting traditional owners and families living in remote Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9413"> communities should also be addressed in the course of your review to establish if the original intent of the ALRA objectives is being achieved. Similarly the lack of competition, adverse trade practices and incompetent administration often impedes commercial developments and compounds unnecessarily high costs in many Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would appreciate the opportunity for an informal discussion in the first instance to pursue and perhaps fine&hyphen;tune some of these matters. I am also aware of a number of community leaders and public servants throughout the Northern Territory who I am sure would appreciate the opportunity to participate in your review. The aspirations of a number of Aboriginal leaders keen to "break away" from the dominance of the NLC and the CLC should also be taken into account. I will forward to you a list of contact names and addresses in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Native title, as it impacts on the Northern Territory, is well documented in the Northern Territory government's submission to the Joint Committee on Native Title. The bill before us, if passed in its current unamended form, will have no impact on the amount of land able to be claimed in the Northern Territory. Claimable land will remain at about 99 per cent with scheduled land expected to cover less than half a per cent of the territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of native title claims lodged in the Northern Territory and surrounding waters to date totals 32, covering some 3.5 per cent&mdash;49,000 square kilometres&mdash;of the territory. The Northern Territory's prime interest in this debate lies in ensuring that native title rights are duly acknowledged and, in turn, in assisting Aboriginal people to overcome social and economic disadvantage whilst, at the same time, delivering a workable land administration system capable of efficiently and effectively serving the interests of commerce and industry, from which all Australians will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the major players, activists and proponents of misinformation and hysteria have a close link with an international agenda of Aboriginal land issues. We must make sure that an appropriate Australian solution is being developed which, firstly, enhances the local priorities and social needs of Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians and, secondly, does so in the context of our national&hyphen;federalist system of Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too cynical to suggest that the motives of some people are being driven by international ideologies or stupid aspirations for independent Aboriginal government within Australia. The debate that rages outside this parliament is again being fed by the same players from Labor and the Left. As Archbishop Peter Hollingworth so aptly said last week on ABC News:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm suggesting that all of us, church leaders and politicians, perhaps might take a cold shower and look at the thing afresh. I don't think these complex and conflicting issues are much helped by what I might call the dewy-eyed sentimentality of people of good will. I don't think that pious generalisations help.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ignorance, emotion and bias are no substitute for damned hard work and attention to the detail in the legislation itself. Although some may be well-intentioned, the Johnnies-come&hyphen;lately to this debate have a vague, distant understanding of this legislation. For the most part they are driving other, totally separate agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, I have received a number of Northern Territory electorate representations reflecting all sides of the debate. Some of the claims, including those of my own Uniting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9415"> Church synod, were unsubstantiated, lacked credible argument and relied on uninformed emotion and media rhetoric. In response, I note that the government's bill has four clear objectives: to maintain and respect native title; to reduce uncertainty; to improve the workability of the native title process; and to find a balance among the interests of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments do not mean the wholesale extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. No native title rights will be acquired or impaired without fair and just compensation. Our amendments do not overturn the Mabo and Wik decisions. In fact, the bill provides a sensible national framework for coexistence, which is missing from the current Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also noticed at the national level that the hyperbole espoused by some Aboriginal leaders and advocacy groups contains four main myths, which are continually rehashed in debate, about the practical applications of this bill. In the interests of a balanced, properly informed debate, these myths must be refuted outright. Firstly: `Coexistence just means access for traditional pursuits.' This actually means a right to have a say in respect of all development on land where there is coexistence. The process and the Native Title Tribunal will create such a bottleneck that most development will be severely impeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly: `The bill allows wholesale extinguishment or diminution of native title.' Most of the exclusions to the right to negotiate process contained in the bill&mdash;for example, provision of facilities for services to the public, enhance primary production capacity, some limited off-lease activities, non-intrusive exploration and other low impact acts&mdash;are all expressed to be subject to the non-extinguishment principle. That is, they can be done but they do not have a permanent effect on native title. If these exceptions were not made, then the only legitimate alternative would be compulsory acquisition, which would extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly: `The bill should be withdrawn and people should just sit down and conduct reasonable negotiations regarding land use proposals.' In code, this means that, unless 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you come to an agreement with the native title claimants, you cannot proceed with the project. It is worse than the current right to negotiate, which is almost a veto, because of the cost and time delay implications and changes to an absolute veto. It is naive to suggest that an Aboriginal group with a superior negotiating position because of some statutory process will not take advantage of that strength.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in response to the statement that the right to negotiate gives native title claimants greater rights than any other land&hyphen;holder, it has been said, `Why shouldn't the first Australians be given special rights and privileges to recognise their special place in our society?' It seems extraordinary that in a liberal multicultural society no&hyphen;one is challenging the long&hyphen;term impact or the logic of making a law that distinguishes one race from the rest. Apart from issues of morality and equality, surely one result of such a law will be to continually emphasise racial difference and to perpetuate division. How can it be in the interests of Aboriginal people to be permanently set apart from Australian society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title legislation we are considering is but one important part of an incredible mosaic of issues and policies before this parliament and the government which impact on the daily lives of Aboriginal people. It is foolish to make native title into a single symbolic `totem&hyphen;pole' gesture expected to give solutions overnight. The challenge is to look ahead 10 or 20 years from now and ask: is what we are doing going to contribute to improved living conditions for Aboriginal people and make for better community relationships? Can we guarantee that the implementation and monitoring of actions by Aboriginal communities themselves and government actions be measurable and improve lifestyle and living standards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To begin to understand such complex issues we must first accept that there are major differences between urban and traditional Aboriginal people and communities that produce strange and necessarily different standards, expectations and dreams&mdash;just as in the wider Australian community. We need to recognise that many Aboriginal people are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9416"> forced to live in two distinct societies with all the necessary obligations to both, whereas the majority of Australians live in one secular society and generally have little appreciation of basic Aboriginal issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two main challenges for Aboriginal people today are in maintaining essential dignity and dealing with the consequences of ghastly violence. Land rights, communication and education&mdash;especially literacy&mdash;are pivotal to ensuring participation in the decision making process and guaranteeing dignity. To solve the dilemmas caused by violence, our efforts must focus on housing, alcohol and substance abuse, health standards and an appreciation of cultural differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has achieved more improvement of services in 20 months than Labor did in 13 years. I commend my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron, for his ministerial determination to address measurable outcomes, especially future employment prospects through reviews of ATSIC, the Abstudy scheme, CDEP and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government's record of achievement for services to Aboriginal communities stands on its own and is now more than ever obvious in the ballot boxes. In the past four years Aboriginal people have shifted their votes in significant numbers away from Labor and across to the Country Liberal Party&mdash;a party which offers the broad-stroke changes and opportunities for the future they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native title legislation and amendments we are now considering will deliver the goods for Aboriginal people. Too many opponents of the legislation and too many headline&hyphen;grabbing media commentators are bogged down in a paternalistic, archaic feudalism which would cast Aboriginal Australians back to the Middle Ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I acknowledge that the word `reconciliation' has a different connotation for each one of us based on our own individual historical background, I for one will not be party to inadequate or stupid proposals which only prolong the time it takes for Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians to have an equal and special place in our society.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I begin tonight, I want to acknowledge the Ngunnawal people, upon whose land we stand tonight during this debate. I also want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of many people who have come to bear witness to this debate. I hope that they will continue to bear witness in the weeks ahead. I admire their restraint during the previous speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion I want all senators to learn from history. I know personally the history of the Wik people, and I will spend most of this address telling their story. It has been a large part of my own story. Everyone is shaped by their experiences. That is as true of communities as it is of individuals. My experience of living with and relating to both pastoralists and Aboriginal people ranges over 35 years. Indeed, I have also met with and shared the experiences of pastoralists who are Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had not met an Aboriginal person until I was appointed as a student Methodist minister to the township of Mitchell in the Maranoa in south-west Queensland. In 1962 Mitchell consisted of two communities: one community, mainly white, lived on the western side of the Maranoa River, while an Aboriginal community lived on the eastern side of the Maranoa River in a fringe camp known as the Yumba. In the 1930s the state government had built two rows of two&hyphen;roomed, unlined timber houses for Aboriginal people who had been pushed off the land in the surrounding districts by the requirements of the pastoral industry. The Yumba had no reticulated water, no electricity, no garbage or nightsoil collection, no public transport and no telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began to visit the community and became closely involved in the lives of the people. I remember well families such as the Fosters, the Mailmans, the Swains, the Dodd family and many others. In 1968 and 1969 the people were moved out of the Yumba and into the main township. As Mitchell had been sewered, the Yumba was seen as a health threat to the main township as well as to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9417"> Aboriginal people. The houses and humpies were bulldozed to the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1985 I was invited by the Aboriginal people to return to the Yumba to share in their celebration of the handing over of title to the reserve to the descendants of the original inhabitants. The old school had been relocated for use as a cultural and teaching facility. It now has electricity, reticulated water and sewerage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience working with the Aborigines of the Yumba was extended in the late 1960s and early 1970s when I lived in Cloncurry in north-west Queensland. The Aboriginal community was physically more integrated into the main township but there were still two communities in many ways. I acknowledge the contributions to my understanding made by such people as Sam Ah Sam, Peter Nardoo, the Lane family, the Cusack family, the Tims family and many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, despite this valuable experience, I acknowledge that 35 years ago I began with many prejudices and at best retained a paternalistic attitude for many years to come. I realise now that prejudice is deeply ingrained in most people. I thank the Aboriginal people because, despite my ignorance about them, they have never given up on me. The road to coexistence and reconciliation is a long one and I am grateful to many Aboriginal people who have walked that road with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collective experience of the churches is similar to my own. For generations no other group of people in Australia cared whether Aboriginal people lived or died, apart from the churches. In recent years it has been fashionable to blame the churches for their at times appalling attitude towards Aboriginal culture and religion. However, this ignores the fact that it was only the churches who provided support, protection and refuge to many of those Aborigines who survived the genocide perpetrated against them by sections of the white community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik people of Cape York illustrate the history of Aboriginal&hyphen;church relationships very well. The Presbyterian Church established mission stations at Old Mapoon in the last century and earlier this century at Aurukun. In 1977 the Uniting Church, of which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Presbyterian Church became a part, took over the administration of those communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wik itself is a generic term meaning speech or language and is used to describe a number of diverse groups which inhabit the western side of Cape York Peninsula. In the 1950s the world's richest deposits of bauxite were discovered in the area. In 1957 the Comalco Act was passed by the Queensland government, which excised nearly 8,000 square kilometres of land from the mission reserve. The church eventually succumbed to pressure from the Queensland government and Comalco and abandoned the mission. However, a number of people refused to move from Old Mapoon until eventually the Queensland police forcibly removed the remaining residents from Old Mapoon to New Mapoon&mdash;near Bamaga on the tip of Cape York&mdash;on 15 November 1963.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth putting on record the eyewitness account of one of the women who was moved from Old Mapoon. Her name is Rachael Peters and she describes her experience like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're the ones that were moved out by police, by gunpoint, (on) that boat they sent for us . . . sneaked in on us in the night . . . they came from Thursday Island. We were really sad, but we just had to go because they told us we were going for questioning. At the Bamaga wharf they told us there were seven houses waiting for us to walk in and light the stoves. And when we arrived in Bamaga there were no homes. We were just standing out in the streets like a mob of cattle with nowhere to go. This is what they do, but the world doesn't know. People don't know how we were treated. They destroyed the homes, burnt them down you know. And I seen all the burning down of the homes, the church . . . it was destroying our culture, our lives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, that 8,000 square kilometres was not enough for these mining companies. In 1975 the Queensland government passed the Aurukun Associates Act, which excised another great slab of Aboriginal land from the Wik people. This was challenged in the Supreme Court and the High Court by the Wik people in the name of Wik elder Donald Peinkinna. The Uniting Church provided him with legal and other support. The Aboriginal people won in the courts but the Queensland government appealed to the Privy Council. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9418"> The Privy Council found in favour of the government on the grounds that the Director of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement was under no obligation to make any particular provision for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1978, after having administered the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities for decades, the Uniting Church was given three weeks to quit those communities so that the Queensland government could take over and stop what it decided were dangerous gestures toward self-determination for the Wik people being supported by the church. The parallels with last week's comment from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicating that the churches should not speak out on Wik are startling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prominent in the leadership of the Presbyterian Church at this time was Reverend Dr John Brown, Reverend Jim Sweet and Reverend Gordon Coutts. The community was outraged by this action of the Queensland government and put the following message to the Moderator of the Uniting Church in Queensland in a telegram from the Mornington Island outpost:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE COMMONWEALTH SIDING AND AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE STOP WE SAY ONE MORE TIME WE DO NOT WANT STATE CONTROL BUT THE CHURCH WITH FEDERAL ASSISTANCE STOP WE ASK THE CHURCH TO STAND BESIDE US IN THIS</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The church at the time was accused of being corrupt and controlled by radicals and communists. The late Professor Roly Busch, then Moderator of the Queensland Synod, replied in a letter to church members dated 20 March 1978 where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some have referred to a `bunch of ratbag socialists' in the Uniting Church in Queensland. We who are nourished in the brilliant insights of the Bible, and who are the inheritors of Calvin, Knox, Cromwell and Wesley, need no political parties, socialist or otherwise, to form our minds on the proper liberties of Christian subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ringing words of the forbears of one of our traditions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In very truth we fight not for glory, nor riches, nor honour, but for that liberty which no true man relinquishes but with his life.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Aurukun and Mornington Island are our brothers and sisters in Christ. They ask for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support and help at this time. We can do no other than stand with them on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was from the head of the Uniting Church in the late 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even this was not enough for the Queensland government. In the early 1980s John Koowarta, on behalf of a group of Wik people, applied to purchase the cattle station at Archer River not far from the Aurukun township. The transfer of the pastoral lease was refused by the government on the basis that government policy opposed proposals to acquire large areas of additional freehold land or leasehold land for development by Aborigines or Aboriginal groups in isolation. In other words, these Aboriginal people were not allowed to own land&mdash;their traditional homelands!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Koowarta challenged the government through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Queensland government challenged the Racial Discrimination Act in the High Court and they lost the case. However, the government, in a fit of pique, made sure that John Koowarta would not benefit from the High Court decision. They changed the title of the lease from a pastoral lease to that of a national park. It seems there is nothing the Queensland government will not do to prevent the Wik people obtaining justice. That is why the Australian Democrats will not add to this shameful record by agreeing to this appalling legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only Aborigines, however, who should fear this legislation. It will provide no certainty to pastoralists either. I understand the feelings of pastoralists, who may believe that they have been singled out by the Mabo and Wik High Court decisions. However, I believe the real threat to pastoralists is from mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that the government seeks to reduce native title holders' rights to negotiate with mining companies to that of pastoralists. If you ask Queensland grain growers or dairy farmers at Mount Larcomb in Central Queensland or those farmers whose properties have been damaged by coalmining in Central Queensland about their experience of dealing with miners, they would soon tell you. I challenge the federal government, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9419"> claims to be the friend of farmers, to introduce legislation to upgrade the right to negotiate for farmers so that they could have some equity in their struggle for justice against mining companies, instead of reducing the rights of Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats stand ready to defend the delicate agreement which was struck between the key stakeholders in 1993. We concede that the Native Title Act is not a perfect piece of legislation. In the areas of representative bodies and the streamlining of applications and agreements there is now widespread acknowledgment that some adjustment is necessary. We do not believe, however, that it is open for governments with failing popularity to `beat up' people's fears, talk down the value of their properties and rationalise their own unlawful behaviour. Land price devaluations have not eventuated, people's backyards have not been taken from them, and mining development and exploration have not ground to a halt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision should have been an opportunity for further advancement in the cause of reconciliation. In clear terms the High Court stated that the sharing of the land&mdash;indeed, coexistence&mdash;is possible. What greater statement of reconciliation could there be and a clear and unambiguous indication that it is possible for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians to share the land? But the High Court also said that, where it is not possible, pastoral rights will prevail. To its discredit, the Howard government has taken this statement by the High Court and used political opportunism to reassert terra nullius, although now they refer to it as Tim Fischer's bucketloads of extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very sad thing about this legislation is that it is unnecessary. It is not necessary to extinguish native title to give certainty to pastoralists. It is not necessary to risk years of court cases over this. An even sadder thing is to see the ALP collapse their principles to support the validation of intermediate period acts. In simple words, this means they will not in this place tell the truth, which is that the Goss Labor government attempted to override native title on behalf of mining interests and that that attempt was wrong. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will call them on this during the committee stage of the bill. If we passed this bill as it is, Australia would become an international pariah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I have outlined my history of association with Aboriginal people in Queensland which began in Mitchell 35 years ago. I have been enriched by this association. I am proud to be able to stand here tonight as the Democrats' native title spokesman and try to bring some justice for Aboriginal people. The Wik people are real people, not some legal concept, and they deserve justice like any other Australians. I call on all senators to use every ounce of intelligence, conscience and resolve that they have in the coming weeks to change the 10-point plan into a plan for fairness, equity and justice, and not pass a bill based on discrimination and injustice.

We will be spending at least the next two weeks in the Senate trying to amend a bill that is an affront to human rights, an affront to the community, an insult to our indigenous peoples and at the end of it all a bill which, if it remained the way it is, would be extremely vulnerable to challenge in the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation primarily deals with native title rights. However, as we know, native title rights are inextricably linked to reconciliation and to justice. Over the past 30 years the historic struggle of our indigenous people has exposed to the wider community the profound interrelationship of land, justice and mutual respect. The Labor Party recognises this and has worked hard towards genuine reconciliation with Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. These achievements are at risk of being undone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our response as a nation to the issue of native title rights is critical in terms of our standing and reputation as an inclusive and democratic society where the rights and interests of all our people are given equal weight and recognition. It is not only our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9420"> international reputation that is at stake here but also our own value system as a people who believe in a fair go for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative path towards reconciliation began with the powers given to the Commonwealth under the 1967 referendum to pass laws and expend funds for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Then came the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which gave force to the external affairs power through our international treaty obligations to address racial discrimination. Since then this parliament has worked to improve the health, education and general wellbeing of indigenous people. The passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 brought a significant shift away from paternalism and the welfare mentality towards greater empowerment and self-determination for our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 was introduced to provide legislative recognition of the Mabo High Court decision, which profoundly changed the structure of land tenure in Australia. The legislation enabled indigenous people to access an alternative and less adversarial means of proving title on lands where native title has yet to be extinguished by later grants or land use in the post&hyphen;colonial era. These three defining acts of parliament&mdash;the Racial Discrimination Act, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act and the Native Title Act&mdash;are fundamental milestones on the long road towards understanding and reconciling ourselves with the past and providing a positive future for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 will also be defining. But, if it is passed in the form that the government proposes, we will be abrogating our responsibilities to enact laws for the benefit of all Australians. It will bring shame on the Australian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard and his government have blindly failed to accept and understand that native title rights are a reality. Native title rights are here to stay; they will not go away. The High Court of Australia has recognised native title rights as fundamental legal property rights. As such, they should be respected 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and protected in the same way that property rights of non-indigenous Australians are respected and protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate tells us more about the coalition government and its leader than perhaps any other issue that has been brought before this parliament since the election. More than anything, the Native Title Amendment Bill is racially discriminatory because it takes rights away from one group on the basis of race&mdash;and you cannot put it any simpler than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government knows that that is the truth because its own legal advisers have told it so. But it has chosen to ignore that advice. If the Senate accepted the legislation as is, without amendment, its provisions would extinguish bucketfuls of native title rights and, in other cases, diminish native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a product of John Howard's lack of leadership. It is typical of his stock in trade&mdash;lowest common denominator, opinion&hyphen;poll driven politics. The government is not only deeply hostile to the concept of native title but deeply ignorant of the operation of the existing native title legislation. The result is the bill before us; born of prejudice, confused, unconstitutional and divisive, it provides no solution, let alone certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the promise of certainty is the platitude that the government keeps mouthing. No, Mr Acting Deputy President, this bill will bring shame to John Howard&mdash;and I think it will bring shame to all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth examining what Mr Howard said, what he promised, in regard to native title before the 1996 election. The coalition's pre-election policy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition approach to Aboriginal land rights is based on the following</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) the fact of Native Title where it has survived;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) the Constitutional protection given to all property interests against Government resumption without compensation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c) the prohibition of racially discriminatory measures or laws; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d) the special relationship between Indigenous people and land which is at the core of Indigenous culture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Government, the Coalition will: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9421">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) retain the Native Title Act; . . . and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c) respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How does the bill before us deliver on those promises? This legislation does not respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and it does not maintain the core principles of the 1993 Native Title Act. As for the so-called fairness on which the coalition's approach to native title rights is based, the words of that pre-election pledge hold no more substance than the stream of other broken promises John Howard has left in his wake since being elected Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry to have to say to the Senate that the role that John Howard has played in this debate on native title rights has been contemptible. I am sorry to have to say to the Senate that he has promoted division. I am sorry to have to say that he has tried to exploit fear and ignorance. But what other conclusion can any reasonable person draw from the spectacle of the Prime Minister of Australia appearing on national television and holding up a map of which 78 per cent was marked and coloured brown and saying these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Aboriginal people . . . have the potential right of veto over the development of 78 percent of the land mass of Australia. Now, that is a very simple message. I think the Australian people will understand that message.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the Prime Minister said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 15 of Mr Howard's own explanatory memorandum to this very bill nailed that very public untruth. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to negotiate was not a veto.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In making that statement on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , the Prime Minister debased his office. It was a divisive, a vengeful and a misleading message to the Australian people. With his geography lecture, Mr Howard was attempting, I believe, to incite fear and raise community tensions. In fact, the Prime Minister's map is as flawed and as inflammatory as his legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will do all it can to prevent this legislation passing in the form that the government proposes. The Australian Labor Party believes that there are certain principles that you cannot back away from; there are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain principles on which, unequivocally, leadership is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard has had ample opportunity to show leadership and vision, but he either will not or cannot deliver. This country is suffering because we have a limited Prime Minister whose whole political career has been driven by one goal&mdash;the goal of becoming Prime Minister. Many of us in the Labor Party admire his doggedness and his determination in his almost 25&hyphen;year struggle to achieve that goal. I can say that I do. But he achieved that ambition in March last year. The point is that his whole focus was on getting into office, there was not a thought about what he would do once he got there, and that is the problem. All John Howard's efforts were concentrated on the glittering prize of becoming Prime Minister. Beyond that, he had no plan, no vision, no sense of destiny for the Australian people and no sense of destiny for where Australia ought to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got to say that I fear we will wait in vain for John Howard to show the high level of leadership which the nation demands on this issue. It really says it all that Mr Howard would even consider an election on race issues. He has reflected in public that he thinks Australia is mature enough for a Wik based election. I think it is appalling that anyone could contemplate such an election. He would divide our country in the most crude terms&mdash;it would be the bush versus the city; black versus white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party could quite easily have adopted a destructive approach to this bill. We could have simply tried to vote this piece of legislation down. We have not taken that path. We have taken a constructive approach; a painstakingly constructive approach. Our comprehensive amendments are designed to effect a real compromise. This process must deliver reconciliation in a real way&mdash;not in a merely theoretical way. All stakeholders must understand that their wish lists are not fully achievable. But we have, through extensive consultation, achieved a package of proposals that will bring equity and fairness to this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate and its outcome will be judged by history. Unlike the Prime Minister, who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9422"> refuses to accept the reality of the Mabo judgment, we do have the vision to see how history would judge this legislation if it went through unamended. Unlike Mr Howard, we believe that certainty and justice can be achieved through native title rights. Let me be absolutely clear: I would be ashamed to be a member of this parliament if we allowed this legislation to go through unamended. Let us not forget that John Howard promised to govern for all Australians. Let all of us never forget our fundamental responsibility to indigenous Australians. We will not cave in and allow this grave injustice to be perpetrated on them. I urge all senators to follow suit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will go some way to clearing up the mess left by the inadequate 1993 Native Title Act. Primary production activities are not subject to the right to negotiate and the higher threshold test aims to sift out the ambit and spurious claims from the genuine. While there is a sunset clause of six years to pursue claims through this legislation, common law rights remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the National Party leader in the Senate, I wish to dispel several myths about native title and the bush. The first is that farming families are opposed to co&hyphen;existing with Aborigines. That is false. Let me quote the NFF's Don McGauchie:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The farmers of Australia do not want to abolish native title . . . The farmers of Australia do not oppose the concept of coexistence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For generations black and white families have coexisted in rural Australia. They have sat down together and made agreements about access. White families have been given precious knowledge of Aboriginal stories and sacred sites.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Both Pat and Mick Dodson have acknowledged this. Pat Dodson told the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality many Aboriginal people have co&hyphen;existed with pastoral owners and have been able to retain their cultural identity and to express that identity without interfering with their property rights or their pastoral property interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mick Dodson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . co&hyphen;existence was, and in many parts of the country today still is, the daily reality on pastoral lease land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was one of the Dodson brothers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in many far&hyphen;flung isolated pastoral leases is an accommodation of two cultures at a grass roots level. John Cobb of the New South Wales Farmers' Federation told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have never had a problem negotiating on a one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one basis for access rights . . . No Aboriginal group has ever found it necessary to go to court over it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The twin icons of the bush and the dreamtime have become intertwined and, as another pastoralist described to the committee, `interdependent on each other'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern expressed by many land holders, both black and white, is that their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9423"> ability to self&hyphen;manage their co&hyphen;existence is being taken away from them. This is done through the unwieldy size and ambit of claims and through having to deal with representative Aboriginal bodies rather than with local people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second myth about farming families is that the native title debate can be expressed as `They are all big foreign owned companies who make heaps of money on huge areas of public land and they should be forced to share it.' Ninety&hyphen;five per cent of the 1,540 individual enterprises not on lease schedule in Queensland are run by families. This covers some 53 per cent of Queensland. Around two per cent have some foreign ownership and about 10 per cent have some corporate ownership, mostly from super and insurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These families have weathered the toughest decade of drought and adverse market factors including high debt and interest rates. Those who have survived face the future afresh with few reserves&mdash;either financial or physical. But their spirit carries them on bulwarked in the past with the support of city and church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, they do not operate on common land but have purchased their property which is alienated crown land. It is at once their home and their business&mdash;a business which slips into overdraft once school fees and overheads are paid. And yet there are calls now for further compromise and parleying over native title. What more can the bush offer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third myth is that farming families stand to gain from this bill while Aborigines will lose. This fallacy stems from a lack of understanding of the processes in the bill regarding acquisition of native title and lease upgrading. Farming families have lost what they were told they had in 1993&mdash;exclusive ownership. They must now struggle with a two-title system on one piece of property. Any upgrading under this legislation has to proceed against very difficult odds&mdash;through both state parliaments and the Senate, for starters. No doubt it will also have to survive a variety of legal and political challenges. A leaseholder must also have a reason to change the condition of lease and land use before 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even beginning the process. And the lessee must have the financial wherewithal to pay for the upgrading. It is not just a gift or a handout. Upgrading is simply not an option for most graziers for all these reasons. Even where it is an option, it will be very difficult to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditional lease upgrading is a standard ongoing practice in land tenure management to enable responses to changes in markets and technology. Farmers themselves have been victims of the national interest in land acquisition for infrastructure, other development and even the breaking up of vast properties to make them into smaller ones. Grazing properties have been cut up near Ayr in Queensland to open up the country to sugarcane production. Where 400 acres once supported 30 or 40 head of cattle, it now produces some 12,000 tonnes of sugarcane at $30 a tonne. That means lots of jobs in mills and support services. It means exports that help black and white in regional in Australia. Black and white work together not only on properties but in the council work forces, mills, abattoirs, railways and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They know which side their bread is buttered on&mdash;the same side. It is in the interests of all Australians that our country be prosperous and job creating. That is the only way out of poverty. That is the way to help the disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth myth about native title and the bush is that anyone with reservations about native title is racist scum. That is absolutely false. If the Dodson brothers can give credence to pastoralists for being part of a daily co-existence, why can't the rest of Australia? They are not racist scum. They are ordinary Australians. They want to support their families like the rest of us. They want to make sure their land tenure is secure, like the rest of us. They want to know what they can or cannot do on their property, something the rest of us take for granted. They want to pay out their mortgage, plan a future and contribute to earning export dollars. Their dreams are our dreams and they too wish to live in harmony with their neighbours. They are not unduly concerned about Aboriginals coming 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9424"> to fish and hunt. That is manageable if it is worked out locally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What few people seem to realise is that many native title crusaders equate native title with much more than traditional pursuits, and that is alarming to rural families whose property is barely able to keep one family, let alone meet the demands for economic native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attempts to define native title at the parliamentary committee hearings met with a range of answers, from native title being a state of mind and heart, to encompassing contemporary rights such as the right to build infrastructure and participate in commercial ventures to assist economic self&hyphen;sufficiency. Father Frank Brennan said that housing `may be a part of contemporary native title rights. People do live in houses nowadays.' He also suggested excisions of a living area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Catholic Commission for Justice, Development and Peace stated on Monday that the best solution is one which takes into account land management practices, and that the right of indigenous people to `participate and develop an economic activity should be recognised'. That is not a reference to fishing or collecting wood for a didgeridoo. Tracker Tilmouth told the native title committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are talking about is an economic framework that indigenous people have to sustain themselves which is not being considered. Hunting, gathering and so forth used to be all right in the old days. It has changed a lot now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So those rights are a greater list of rights now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement supported the Indigenous Land Corporation's submission to the parliamentary committee, stressing that native title does not simply equate to another form of title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since first devised, the Howard government's <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  has been an exercise in deception, discrimination and ultimately dispossession. The government has continually misled the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9426"> Australian public on this bill. For example, various ministers, especially Senator Minchin, have said time and time again that there is no extinguishment contained in this legislation. Well, Senator Minchin, the game is up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By now everyone in this chamber should know that the High Court held in Wik that, when pastoralist and native title rights are inconsistent, the pastoral rights will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. The High Court did not say that such an inconsistency would extinguish native title. Yet,  by virtue of sections 23F, 23G and 23I of the government's bill, native title will be permanently extinguished in such circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Minchin well knows, this is not the only form of extinguishment made possible by the Native Title Amendment Bill. The extinguishment may not always be as obvious as a clause or a division. It may work via a schedule, a sunset clause or it may require the cooperation of a state or territory government. Nevertheless, it proposes massive dispossession of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state, the Premier, Richard Court, has claimed that senior public servants in the so&hyphen;called Mabo unit&mdash;the one which was involved in the belligerent, wasteful and divisive Native Title Act case&mdash;were key players in drafting the Commonwealth's Native Title Amendment Bill. Simultaneously, we have seen all around Western Australia the state government enacting Crown to Crown grants in order for this form of extinguishment to take effect as soon as this bill is passed. Make no mistake, this is a concerted attack on Aboriginal people by state and Commonwealth governments alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, and in particular Senator Minchin, has displayed a level of unprecedented arrogance and paternalism in the debate around this bill. The very fact that consultation has not continued with indigenous Australians is the absolute epitome of this. I spoke to Robert Bropho, who is an elder from the Swan Valley Nyungar community, and he said that there is just no evidence of consultation with the community from his viewpoint&mdash;no effort at all from the government to try to help people to understand what the issues are.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this is such a fundamentally piece of legislation renders the government's arrogance even more reprehensible. When the finest lawyers in the country say the bill is legally and constitutionally flawed, the government says they are wrong. When the churches declare the bill unfair, they are wrong. When Amnesty International says the bill breaches human rights obligations, they are wrong. When thousands of people gather around the country to ask the country to withdraw the bill, they are wrong. When British politicians declare the bill discriminatory, they are wrong. When the Greens expose the injustice of the physical connection test in this bill, we are wrong. And, of course, when Aboriginal people say that the measures contained in this bill will destroy their culture, they are wrong. Senator Minchin knows better than all these people and I think this is taking paternalism just a tad too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From here on, government senators are on warning. The Greens and the other non&hyphen;government parties have gone through this bill with a fine&hyphen;tooth comb. We know every avenue of extinguishment, every attempt to scale back rights, every clause which makes it difficult for Aboriginal people to exercise their land rights. If you insist on reviving the era of unutterable shame that blighted Australia for so long, you will forever stand condemned as the architects of this revival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole debate has been characterised by an inability on the part of the government to recognise the distinct and unique relationship between Aboriginal people and the land. It has been characterised by a government that views native title purely as an inconvenient property right to be read down in line with the narrowest possible interpretation of common law. There is one word for a policy approach which seeks to absorb Aboriginal cultural imperatives. That word is `assimilation' and assimilation is really only a euphemism for cultural genocide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a policy which harks back to the dark, shameful days in Australia's history when the answer to the so&hyphen;called Aboriginal `problem' was to blend indigenous people and culture into European&hyphen;based society. When this government diminishes and extinguishes the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9427"> `special' property rights of Aboriginal people, it diminishes and extinguishes Aboriginal culture and, in my opinion, it diminishes Australia. As Peter Yu, from the Kimberley Land Council, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extinguish our title and you extinguish our people. Remove or diminish our title rights and our culture cannot remain like a parcel of possessions carried around by each individual indigenous person. It collapses and dies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What sort of a Prime Minister says, on a public issue of such vital importance to the character and future of this country, that the public is  `not terribly interested' and that the best thing we could do is to simply get this debate `over and done with' and move on to issues of greater importance? Well, Mr Howard, there is no issue of greater importance to Australian society than how we, as non&hyphen;indigenous Australians, reconcile with the people whose land we have stolen and whose society we have decimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything we have as a society&mdash;our wealth of resources, our comfortable and privileged position in the world&mdash;has been achieved at the expense of the ongoing suffering and dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We owe an enormous debt and an enormous apology to Aboriginal people. For a government to shirk this responsibility is, in the most precise sense of the term, racist, for it reflects a view that says short&hyphen;term economic priorities in non&hyphen;indigenous society are more important than the manifest injustices inflicted on indigenous people for more than 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard in particular seems to be in a state of denial about his discriminatory tendencies. When questioned recently about the government's removal of the right to negotiate in this bill, he gave the extraordinary response that this was not a violation of Aboriginal rights because it was a right conferred by statute and not by common law. As the National Indigenous Working Group has pointed out on many occasions, the right to negotiate has provided many Aboriginal people with their only opportunity to protect themselves from the negative impact of development on their traditional lands. Whether the right derives from statute or common law is of little importance to Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people attempting to maintain their custodial responsibility in the face of hundreds of mining companies seeking to exploit their traditional lands. Perhaps too the Prime Minister needs to be reminded that pastoral leases are also a property right conferred by statute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government says that the native title holder's right to negotiate on a pastoral lease is inequitable because pastoralists do not have the same right, it dangerously echoes the sentiments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). If this government has adopted the Hansonite view that Aboriginal people have been afforded special privileges which must now be stemmed in order to preserve some warped view of equality, it stands condemned for ignoring both the history and the current reality of Aboriginal oppression and fourth world standing in our society. As Phillip Adams recently identified, there is something far worse than racism, and that is exploitation of the racism of others for short&hyphen;term advantage. In addition, when the government presents such a view, it deliberately ignores the view that the right to negotiate was a trade&hyphen;off for widespread validation in the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last few months we have heard the mining industry complaining repeatedly about the unworkability of the Native Title Act. Their calls have confused the community, shaken the resolve of the Labor Party and been taken up with glee by the government. On the weekend we saw the mining industry go so far as to take out full&hyphen;page advertisements in support of the government's legislation. The government and the mining industry are hand in glove.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the advertisements do not reveal is that, while Aboriginal people have continuously demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and reach compromise, many mining companies, in conjunction with hostile state governments, have deliberately sought to sabotage the native title process. So used to getting their way behind closed doors and being able to ride roughshod over indigenous rights, they have only come into the native title process kicking and screaming. In Western Australia the Court government has joined 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9428"> in, spending millions of dollars, launching ludicrously unsuccessful High Court actions rather than accepting the reality of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservative governments have made much of the burden of future act provisions which require negotiation with multiple claimants. It is difficult to establish on what basis their complaints can be considered genuine, because the act's regime has barely been implemented according to the law of native title as established by the legislation in the courts. The thousands of potentially illegal future acts granted on pastoral leases since 1994 which this government now wishes to validate provide a graphic example of the way in which state governments have gone about flagrantly breaching the native title act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until two years ago, when the state of Western Australia was ordered to negotiate in good faith, as required by the act in the courts, the Court government's strategy was simply to wait until the negotiation period under the Native Title Act had elapsed and then to apply for a tribunal determination. Nevertheless, Western Australia appears to be the jurisdiction in which the future act regime is most fully utilised. Moreover it is also the jurisdiction in which it appears that native title claimants have made the most use of the act to lodge applications. It has not only the highest number of claims but also the highest number of overlapping claims in Australia. It is, therefore, in Western Australia that it might be expected that the so&hyphen;called unworkability of the system would be most apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of this, the mining industry, which is most involved with the future act regime of native title in Western Australia, is highly prospective. Areas subject to mining tenement applications to the Department of Minerals and Energy in 1996&hyphen;97 had increased by more than 10 million hectares since 1991&hyphen;92. With this kind of prolific development, it is difficult to sustain the position that the existing Native Title Act has resulted in an unworkable system. Would the whole of Western Australia need to be subject to mining tenements before the advocates of amendment considered there was a workable system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that overlapping claims have resulted in a level of tension and anguish 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within Aboriginal communities. Nonetheless, it appears somewhat patronising for non&hyphen;indigenous people to imagine that indigenous communities are incapable of dealing with these contentious issues. On numerous occasions, indigenous communities have demonstrated their ability to reach workable outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To insist that systems of communal native title will fit neatly and distinctly into a particular system of land and waters without overlapping is ethnocentric in the extreme. Perhaps if John Howard had bothered to spend any time in Aboriginal communities in the last year, he would have a greater understanding of what Justice Brennan in Mabo termed: . . . a subtle and elaborate system of rules adapted to the country in which they led their lives and providing a stable order of society remarkably free from vagaries of personal whim and influence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This unworkability line is one of the most astonishingly hypocritical arguments in the entire native title debate. So what if a mining company has to negotiate with more than one native title claimant group? If a mining company wanted to dig up a dirty great big hole in the see of Bennelong, I reckon you would have about 50,000 people to negotiate with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, as more than one native title claimant has pointed out to me, it is not considered unworkable that native title claimants have to be involved in negotiations with multiple mining companies over possibly hundreds of different future act proposals which affect their land. It seems clear that the changes proposed are not so much directed towards meeting indigenous concerns as towards addressing the time frames of the mining corporations of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Liberal MP Ian Viner told the joint parliamentary committee looking at this bill that, from his experience on the Native Title Tribunal, the present act has been working well. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this bill aims to do would only create more uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is absolutely essential to the maintenance of Aboriginal culture, identity and independence that their native title rights on pastoral leases be confirmed and maintained. Remember, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9429"> what this government wishes to do is extinguish and remove those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples of this need, but I will speak to just one, in my home state of Western Australia. The traditional lands of the Ngarinyin people of the Kimberley region are now covered by 12 pastoral leases. Their land claim has been running for decades. They followed the Mabo case into the High Court and were then diverted to the Native Title Tribunal. Their link to the land goes back to time immemorial; rock art in their country has been confirmed as being at least 17,000 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just this year, the Ngarinyin people were treated with the kind of indignity and subjected to the type of shame that Australians should now have put far behind us&mdash;no less than an act of apartheid. And it was all because their land now happens to be subjected to pastoral lease occupation. In July of this year, Ngarinyin lawmen led a party of dignitaries, including the Anglican Archbishop of Perth, Peter Carnley, to visit sacred and learning sites in their country. The tour is part of their tremendous Ngarinyin `bush university' initiative. Yet, incredibly, after visiting the famous Guyan Guyan paintings at the Drysdale River station, the group was prevented from leaving the station by a two&hyphen;metre high earthen wall which had been hastily bulldozed into place by the pastoralist. It took the group nearly an hour, working with a shovel and bare hands, to remove enough earth to clear a path for vehicles. When asked why the wall had been erected, the pastoralist replied that she and she alone wanted to determine who could have access to the lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a black armband view of history; this is Western Australia in 1997. It is a graphic example of why the coexistence model established in common law by the Wik decision needs to be fully implemented without derogation or qualification. It is why the extinguishment contemplated by this government&mdash;why the removal of indigenous rights so that people such as the Ngarinyin will have to rely on the charity of pastoralists&mdash;is totally unacceptable. I would like to quote from what the Ngarinyin Kamali Council have said themselves:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is what `extinguishment' really means. It means killing off our chance to survive as a living culture, as a people, as participants in the future of Australia. It means extinguishing our birthright and meaning.</PARA>

He used the occasion to set out `a modern Liberal approach to the role of government'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first principle of good government, he told his audience, was to lead and unite Australians by engendering a sense of com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mon purpose and community cooperation. This legislation is a telling example of how Prime Minister John Howard and his government have forsaken his first principle of good government. Mr Howard is not a leader on these issues; he is a follower. The evidence is there for all to see on the parliamentary and public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my utter dismay, since the election last year we have seen, under Mr Howard's leadership, the worst division between Australians that I have witnessed in all of my adult life. Aboriginal Australia effectively lost its voice in government on the night of the last election. One need look no further than that first headland speech to find the reason why. The Prime Minister told his audience:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a frustrated mainstream in Australia today which sees government decisions increasingly driven by the noisy, self&hyphen;interested clamour of powerful vested interests with scant regard for the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said, about this style of government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would change profoundly under the Liberal and National parties. Under us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the views of all particular interests will be assessed against the national interests and the sentiments of mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister firmly believes that this legislation is in the national interest because it reflects the views of mainstream Australia. He knows that mainstream Australia has difficulty in associating the history of colonisation, dispossession and government control of Aboriginal people with the problems seen today in the indigenous community. He knows that the subject of equity for indigenous people in mainstream Australia is clouded by long held presumptions and myths. It is there in black and white in the extensive research which has been conducted on behalf of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet before and since the coalition assumed government. I have read it. It has been provided to this Senate through the estimates process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From day one of this government, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has fed those presumptions and myths back into mainstream Australia at every possible opportunity. His 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9431"> rhetoric mirrors his research. He has used it to conduct a cold war of attrition against articulate indigenous leaders such as the Dodsons, the O'Donoghues and others. In the process, this Prime Minister has all but destroyed the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criticism has been rightly directed at participants on both sides of this debate for emotional and inaccurate generalisations about the Wik decision and this legislation. A great deal of this, however, was generated from the top by the inexcusable performance of our Prime Minister on national television holding up a map of Australia and making the unqualified and completely false statement that the Wik decision would allow Aborigines `to stop development over 78 per cent of Australia'. It, of course, allowed nothing of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has also joined his Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and others in criticising the so&hyphen;called judicial activism of the High Court. I wondered at the time about how they would react if their rights before the courts were dismissed in the same cavalier fashion as they wish to dismiss those of indigenous Australians. All the High Court was doing, as anyone who has bothered to read the judgments would know&mdash;whether you agree or disagree with them&mdash;was its job of determining an issue for litigants on the facts placed before it. God help us if the court ever stops doing that! I can find, in fact, no better defence of the rightful role of the High Court than the concluding passage from the judgment of Mr Justice McHugh in the Waanyi case. His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community will quickly lose confidence in the courts of justice if a perception arises that the courts are ready to ignore the legal rights of individuals whenever intervening governments or litigants urge that public or private convenience requires such rights to be by&hyphen;passed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hear! Hear! But this is precisely what the Prime Minister hopes to achieve with this legislation. He wants to see the common law rights of indigenous people bypassed. This government will brook no opposition, but what a mess it has created in the process!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In just two days last week, we had the Prime Minister deliver a set piece assault on

In his prime ministerial admonition, Mr Howard advised church leaders that the right to speak freely carried with it the obligation to do so `in an informed, objective and constructive manner'. Our Prime Minister, unfortunately, does not practise what he preaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already spoken of the prime ministerial television appearance which could not have been more ill&hyphen;informed and destructive. Honourable senators may also recall that the Prime Minister called his first press conference in Canberra as Prime Minister to announce that he was putting a special auditor into ATSIC and freezing the flow of funds to hundreds of indigenous organisations around this country. He also announced that the government would seek legislative change, which they did, to give them the power to sack the entire ATSIC board and install an administrator. This was the first press conference in Canberra of the newly elected Prime Minister. The appointment of the special auditor was later found by the Federal Court to be unlawful and this Senate blocked the attempt to impose an administrator on ATSIC if the government so desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that all of this was done by the Howard government without a single word of prior consultation with a single Aboriginal person or with ATSIC, the principal policy adviser in indigenous affairs to this government. Had he or his minister bothered to consult ATSIC, they would have been informed, as the Senate now knows, that a major review was already under way into the very issue and was due to report shortly. The special auditor, in fact, cleared 95 per cent of those Aboriginal corporations and the review&mdash;the one the Prime Minister never bothered to acquaint himself with&mdash;has subsequently reported that those corporations are 60 times more accountable than similar non&hyphen;indigenous organisations incorporated under state laws. This report has been sitting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9432"> on the minister's desk for more than one year now with no action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That one news conference and the subsequent alarmist nationwide media coverage reinforced decades of misinformation and myth about accountability in Aboriginal affairs and it came, I regret to say, from the top. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, to his shame, even defended the government's action at that news conference by citing here in the Senate tabloid press reports which incorrectly claimed that the special auditor had found 95 per cent of the organisations in contravention of their grant conditions. When we pointed this out, and it is a matter of public record, to the minister he agreed that the newspaper reports were absolute garbage, but he said&mdash;and it is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that it was not his duty to inform the Senate as to the accuracy of the newspaper reports from which he was quoting. So much for the prime ministerial duty to speak in an informed, objective and constructive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine a national government dealing with any other part of its constituency in such a dismissive and deceitful way? This was not an isolated incident. The Prime Minister and his government have continued in the way they started. I cite, for example, the shameful fiasco over Pat Dodson's reappointment to the National Council for Reconciliation. I think I speak on behalf of most Australians when I say that, over those five or six years, Mr Dodson has established for himself a reputation as one of the most distinguished Australians in public life today, and it is a loss to the nation that he is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Pat Dodson told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last week&mdash;I thought he put the point well&mdash;he had given five or six years of his life to progressing national reconciliation through the council and the government could not wait five or six days to talk to him about whether he should be reappointed or not. One could spend hours reciting the offence that this lack of consultation has caused indigenous Australia. Suffice it to say that, in pursuing his indigenous affairs agenda, this Prime Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has sought no meaningful counsel in Aboriginal Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister clearly has no understanding of how important consultation is to Aboriginal people. He appears to genuinely fear the exercise of indigenous economic and political power, and he publicly equates self-determination with separatism. He was saying the same thing in the parliamentary debates on the establishment of ATSIC a decade ago. The debate has moved on. The Prime Minister has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of constituents sitting in the public gallery tonight who are so concerned about this legislation that they have travelled thousands of kilometres from the Territory to express their concerns. They feel that this legislation does not provide them with justice. I would like to read out a statement that they have provided to me on behalf of their communities. The statement to the Prime Minister and federal parliament reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are the women landowners and land council members from across Northern Australia and we call on the Prime Minister and the Federal Parliament to respect and defend our native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are lifting our voices for our rights, for our dreaming and for our culture, and for the future of our children, grandchildren and great&hyphen;grandchildren. We are speaking from our hearts for our culture, our spirituality and our law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want all Australians to understand that their children's rights in the land and the sea will also be diminished by the so-called 10 point plan. How will Australians be able to protect the environment for all the children if the Parliament hands over the rights of all Australians to a few big companies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under your amendments, Mr Howard, development can go ahead without even talking to us, damaging our culture and our law, damaging our traditional hunting grounds, and polluting our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our law tells us that our rights to land and sea cannot be broken. We are responsible for our sacred places and our traditional country from the beginning of time to the end of time. We are responsible for ensuring that the law is passed on and that our land is protected. Our spirituality can be seen and heard in our songs and dances. Native title is the recognition by Australian law of our customary spirituality and our responsibilities for land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reject the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act. They are an attack on our life, our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9433"> religious beliefs and on our spiritual relationships with the land and sea. Sea country is just as much a part of our law as the dry land. Our people's dreamings include the dolphin, the crocodile, the turtle, the stingray and the dugong, as well as birds and all the other native animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not accept the denial of our rights on pastoral leases and other land. We will not give up our right to negotiate because the right to have a say over our country is our life. The right to negotiate enables us to protect our culture and our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We instruct our land councils to do everything possible to protect our rights to land and sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We take responsibility on behalf of all Australians and future generations to call for an end to the hysteria which is dividing this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask the women of Australia of all cultures to support us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not give up our fight for our inherited rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hear, hear!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a meeting in this building this afternoon with that women's delegation. The chairman of the meeting asked Mary Yamirr, who is a senior landowner&mdash;indeed, a leader of the Aboriginal community at Minjilang, Croker Island, whom I have known for 30 years&mdash;`What is it we can do to help heal these wounds, to help reduce the tension and division currently in the community?' I wrote down what she said. These are the words of the leader of a small Aboriginal community in Minjilang, in the Northern Territory. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that all of us should live together in this country respecting each other's law and culture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a shame we do not have a national leader who holds the same views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, there are three ways a national government can respond to the Wik judgment. It can legislate, litigate or negotiate. There are many people throughout Australia, both indigenous and non-indigenous, pastoralists and non-pastoralists, who understand that this government will not provide them with certainty in this legislation. If this legislation passes through this parliament unamended, it will simply lead to more litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will help to deliver certainty is negotiation. The government should be big enough 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to acknowledge that the controversial elements of this legislation must be amended. We are prepared, as the government knows, to support valid amendments to this legislation. As I said on ABC radio in Darwin this morning, a number of these amendments were already in train when we were in government as a result of the Brandy and Waanyi decisions. But we will not adopt the same dog in the manger approach that this government did when in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When John Howard last lost the leadership of the Liberal Party in the late eighties, he described the prospect of his returning to the leadership as&mdash;I quote him&mdash;Lazarus with a triple bypass. Now that he has succeeded to the highest political office in the land, a question now remains: has John Howard been left with enough heart for the job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will take a lot of heart to admit it, but let us admit that the fears and apprehensions about native title are in the mind, not on the land. This bill, as it has been presented to this parliament, is discriminatory, unfair and legally flawed. Indigenous people say so; members of this government say so; the Prime Minister's legal advice says so; external legal advice says so; the churches say so; a host of community groups say so; and the High Court ultimately will say so. It is surely time for this government to say so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the chamber for the opportunity to speak tonight on what I think&mdash;certainly in my time in politics since 1986&mdash;is the most important piece of legislation that I have ever had the opportunity of addressing. I speak in very generic terms tonight in the second reading debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  in support of the government amendments. I particularly direct my contribution to Western Australia, a state to which I owe much and which I know very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia contributes an enormous amount to the federal economy. It comprises 9.7 per cent of the nation and has some 1.78 million people, yet it contributes 30 per cent of export income. It contributes that income as a result of the ingenuity of the people who choose to reside in Western Australia and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9434"> those God&hyphen;given rights and elements that we have been so blessed with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to agree with what Senator Bob Collins and other speakers on his side of the House have just outlined&mdash;that we should allow the right to negotiate to continue&mdash;Western Australia would fail in its contribution to the nation, so the nation would suffer. If we were to reach some sort of consensus with Aboriginal and Euro-Aboriginal people, we would also, by mere dint of the legislation that exists at the moment, if it were not amended, also fall behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe&mdash;I speak personally here&mdash;that Australia is my country and Australia is the country of those constituents in Western Australia whom I represent here. Australia belongs to all people. Australia is not a nation that should be divided because of the colour of one's skin. Australia is not a nation that should take any pride in singling out people for racial discrimination. But Australia has a duty to people of this nation, not just people of one particular colour and not just because of a person's background or particular religion. It is not a sectarian issue; this is an issue that is based on race. This is an issue that the government is trying to redress so that it equates to a distribution of wealth for all people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia is a nation blessed with mineral resources. We have the biggest diamond mine in the world, producing some 38 million carats of diamonds annually. We have the biggest iron ore mines in the world, producing billions of dollars worth of iron ore exports annually and competing with the Carajas mine in Brazil as the equal biggest. Western Australia is the fourth biggest producer of gold in the world. Western Australia is the biggest exporter of alumina powder in  the world. Western Australia is the fifth biggest producer of nickel in the world, in all sorts of shapes and formulae. This year Western Australia will produce over 10 million tonnes of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia is rich by any means. But when the dead hand of native title claims 82 per cent of Western Australia, as it is at the moment, Western Australia will cease to be a world leader and a major contributor to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> federal economy. Then there will be people&mdash;perhaps there are some here tonight, living off the public purse&mdash;who may regret their actions. Maybe there will be people who will regret their actions tonight; ill-informed people who do not understand that, in order to maintain a democracy like we enjoy&mdash;one of the oldest in the world&mdash;we need to have an economy that is commensurate with that. Where you do not have social services to the degree that we do in Australia rightly looking after people, then you have poor economies. They go together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make sure during my time here that I do what I believe is best for all Australians. I am not going to single out any particular group, nor am I going to deny the rights that Aboriginal people have in this nation&mdash;rights given to them in equality and in fairness and in lateness, in 1967, when they were ushered into the Australian family with all its benefits. That measure was some decades, if not some generations, late in coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If 82 per cent of Western Australia at the moment were not subject to native title claims, Aboriginal people&mdash;or those who choose to be called Aboriginal people&mdash;would still have 50 sheep and cattle stations in Western Australia. They would still have their historic Aboriginal lands. Those amount to 38 million acres. To put that in perspective, that is greater than the aggregate of the United Kingdom. It is a vast area of land if one single native title claim does not succeed! I think it is rather interesting to note that the only single native title claim that has succeeded by negotiations to date since 1993 is an area of freehold land in New South Wales that was sold within minutes of its being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to ask oneself about the bona fides attached to some Aboriginal people. I do not include all Aboriginal people in that. I have spent a great deal of my life, if not all of it, juxtaposed with Aboriginal people and I must say that I have the greatest deal of respect for them, but they are not the people who are driving the Aboriginal industry. A lot of these people here tonight hissing and trying to intimidate speakers like me are the ones who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9435"> are driving the Aboriginal industry, and that is a big problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to be drawn into the simplistic retort by Senator Forshaw, but let me say this in case it is said of me that I concentrated on the economics of the problems that exist and that face Australia today: it is not the economics solely that worry me. That is certainly a preoccupation of mine&mdash;and I do not deny it&mdash;but what worries me also is the division that is being driven between Aboriginal people, Euro&hyphen;Aboriginal people and other Australians. I find that dangerous. I find that dangerous in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want divisions in Australia like those that exist in the United States of America, like that that existed in what was then Rhodesia, like that that existed in the old South Africa and still exist there. I do not want that. I do not want that sort of discrimination and division that exists today in India, where the untouchable caste system still exists. I want people of all colour and all ilks and all backgrounds to be equal in this nation, one of the greatest democracies on earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This nation is equal in its area to the United States of America&mdash;three million square miles each&mdash;and yet in it we have 19 million people and in the United States of America there are 250 million&hyphen;odd people. There is plenty of land for everyone, but it must not be an issue where hatred and division are promoted on the basis of the colour of someone's skin and, in turn, on land. That should not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read a few things to do with the mining industry and those problems facing Western Australia, because Western Australia's problems become Australia's problems in economic terms. I know that we are a long way away. I know that we suffer the tyranny of distance. I know we are seen by others sometimes as something of an oddity, but we are actually good Australians. We contribute more than our share to the privy purse and we do not worry about that because we know there are other areas in Australia, particularly social areas, that need that wealth that Western Australia generates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But all I ask is that you let us continue to generate that area that we have some expertise in and that flows back to Australia, because it is of great benefit to the whole nation. When we earn 30 per cent of export income with less than 10 per cent of the people, of course Western Australia contributes to the nation. When we are 9.7 per cent of the population and yet we pay 10.6 per cent of income tax to the nation, we pay more than our share. But we cannot continue to do it unless we resolve Aboriginal ambit claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote a case: a company wishing to extend their existing pit operations in and around Kalgoorlie were forced to pay $500,000 in cash to one Aboriginal family to continue their operations; otherwise the mine would have shut down. That family happened to live in Albany&mdash;not meeting the threshold test as proposed under the 10&hyphen;point plan but that was what we were subject to because of the right to negotiate. Half a million dollars went out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote another one: a company wishing to establish a new $21 million processing plant and to develop a new ore body have suspended their expansion plans due to the demands placed on them by native title claimants. That is not good for the native title claimants even if they are bona fide. That has to be rectified. The 10-point plan will rectify that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 3: a mining group, having put their treatment plant under `care and maintenance' because of their inability to convert prospecting licences to mining licences because of native title claimants, have walked away. That is not good for the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 4: a sandmining contractor who has been operating in the region around Kalgoorlie for years, providing garden sand, has closed his entire business because it is subject to native title claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 5: most mining operators have received letters from representatives of several different claimant groups&mdash;almost invariably from a lawyer&mdash;offering to inspect the claimed tenement area for a fee, with the clear indication that a failure to provide work to that group may result in difficult and protracted negotiations further down the track. These 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9436"> `letters of demand' proposed payments for the `Aboriginal attendants' of $500 and upwards per person per day and the provision of a good quality four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicle for the entire period of the investigation, generally unspecified but left open ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, around Kalgoorlie and juxtaposed to those areas around Kalgoorlie, a small mining tenement attracted `fees' of $1,200 per claimant per day for the claimants to inspect the site for clearance. The total aggregate of the cost of the clearance was $85,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 7: many large mining concerns are increasingly diverting their exploration budget overseas. For the first time in our history, more of Australians' exploration dollars are going overseas, and it is because of the dead hand of native title claim. If we can fix that, if we can make sure that the threshold tests meet what we would consider to be reasonable, those dollars will flow back into Australia for exploration. No exploration, no mines. No mines, then Western Australia ceases to become the premier exporting state of this nation and all Australians, including Aboriginal and Euro&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians, will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many large mining concerns of course know that they cannot meet the demands made by some unscrupulous claimants. I am careful in not saying all are, and I want that to be a matter of record. Some claimants&mdash;many of them, indeed&mdash;are bona fide claimants, and they have my sympathy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large mining concern has been told to hand over its substantial pastoral holdings, or Aboriginal groups will no longer negotiate clearances for its mining operations. I have already told you that Aboriginal people own 50 sheep and cattle stations in Western Australia. The Mungari industrial park was set up four or five years ago between Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. The park, subject to the native title claim system, carried out the mining concern's clearance obligations. Local Aboriginal representatives identified two small sites of significance. The planning then protected those sites by appropriate buffers against any surrounding development, limiting the area of the park.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the development was completed, another group of different Aboriginal people claimed other significant sites, and these too were subsequently deleted from the park boundary. During a further clearance process for the industrial waste site, an anthropologist identified a site which is now protected under the relevant act. That site measures only 0.5 metres by one metre and consists of a broken bottle described in the report as `a scatter of green bottle glass with a total of 16 pieces'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I now shift on to sandalwood operators&mdash;not people associated with St Georges Terrace entrepreneurs, not people associated with multimillionaires, but hardworking people who use their ingenuity and their bushcraft to survive. Sandalwood operators, harvesting on crown land, now have to obtain native title clearance prior to commencing operation. This obviously, to people who know the industry and who know the area, is going to take years and will destroy the sandalwood industry. The industry is dealing with overseas purchasers who obviously demand action. Pastoralists who have operated on stock accounts with pastoral houses and overdrafts at banks have had severe limits placed upon them due to the insecurity of their tenure. Their ability to maintain viable operations with limited financial accommodation is restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Towns like Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Leonora, Laverton, Yalgoo, Meekatharra, Mount Magnet and Cue have all been curtailed in their expansion because of native title being claimed right up to their boundaries. For instance, in Kalgoorlie a house purchased for $56,000 in 1995 recently sold for $162,000, because of the restricted supply of land. A quarter acre lot purchased for $80,000 eight months ago has attracted an offer of $120,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether all of this is worth the dissension, the division, the hatred and the antipathy that is going on. I do not want to see my country divided, but what I can tell this house tonight is that this is my country. This country belongs to 19 million people. This country does not belong to any section or community. This country does not belong to two per cent of the population. This coun 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9437"> try belongs to those people who live and reside here and who choose to be called Australians. I do not want to see my country further divided. I do not want to see the continuing hatred, although I fear it is going to burgeon. I do not want to see these problems artificially promoted that are likely to divide us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that this is the greatest country in the world. It will only continue to be so if we are able to cope with this problem before us&mdash;if we are able to debate it and if everyone has the opportunity to so do and not be curtailed in what they have to say. Neither one side nor the other can lay claim to being more passionate about being an Australian&mdash;not your sectional interests, Labor, not yours, Democrats, not yours, Greens, and certainly not mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to finish by saying this: I do believe that we can resolve the problem. I do not believe that division is necessarily the best way to go. I do not believe that an adversarial approach to it is the best way. I am sure we can resolve it. We need the 10-point plan to be implemented to resolve it. I have watched it, I have studied it and I have read it carefully. It will resolve the problem. It will not detract from Aboriginal claimants, nor would I support it if it did. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the next two weeks this parliament will be given a unique, historic opportunity to meet the moral, cultural and economic challenges surrounding the native title entitlements with which we are faced. These challenges we cannot ignore; we might wish to, but we cannot. We are faced with a number of High Court decisions which we must consider, the latest of which is the decision known colloquially as the Wik decision. All that that decision in fact did was to hold that the granting of a pastoral lease, whether or not the lease had now expired, did not necessarily extinguish all native title rights and interests that might otherwise exist. It sounds somewhat innocuous. But that decision raised more questions than it solved, and it is those questions that we must address when we are giving consideration in the committee stage to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the clauses of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we faced with these challenges which emerge from the courts? The reason is that legislatures, both state and federal, over a number of years, have refused or failed to deal with the important issue of native title. The 1993 Native Title Act was a response by the then government to Mabo. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is this government's response to Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: how do we in this parliament respond? We can either do so negatively or positively. We can see this as an opportunity&mdash;an opportunity to contribute to reconciliation and restoration of trust; an opportunity to address these issues, applying the principles of social justice, of fairness, of distributive justice; an opportunity to deal with the issues without affecting, but in fact promoting, the development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are we going to do that? It would be desirable for all of us to do so with a degree of decorum and dignity, if we can bring it out, and also with as much nous as we possibly can. There should be an informed debate. When we walk into this place, we should leave the guns of ambit claims at the door. We should not approach the issue with an `ambit attitude'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be said by the drafters of the 10&hyphen;point plan that there were consultations; indeed, there were&mdash;a large number of consultations in the development of the 10&hyphen;point plan. By and large, that plan has been incorporated in the legislation that is before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I feel that nobody would be surprised to be told that the legislation, as printed, requires substantial amendment before it passes this chamber. I believe the Prime Minister has indicated as much, inferentially at least, by the fact that he gave a commitment prior to the last election that the Racial Discrimination Act would not be impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as a result of that, one needs to look carefully at this legislation to assess whether it contains any discriminatory provisions and any decisions which would arbitrarily extinguish native title. We also have to have regard, I suppose, to what might occur 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9438"> in the Hindmarsh Bridge case, and the interpretation that may be given in that judgment to the constitutional provisions and how they should operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, and I hope, that there will be an absence of political points scoring during the debate. There has been a little bit of that up to date in the second reading stage&mdash;a little disappointing. But I do not think this measure, as important as it is, should be used as a political football or for the grandstanding of members to the media or anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media at times inflames more than it informs; but on this particular subject, by and large, those times have been the exception. However, I do appeal to the media to let us get on with it and give us a bit of space, a bit of a breather, so that we can, over the next week, be able to engage in those discussions, without everybody breathing down our necks as to what we are doing, whom we have talked to and what arrangements we have come to, and so on. I do make that appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do want to get on with it. We should be open to honourable compromise. It will be a difficult time. Of course, not all of the measures in this piece of legislation are contentious. Quite a considerable amount of this legislation is not contentious&mdash;for example, those provisions that are to amend the Native Title Act 1993, having regard to the Brandy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, at the end of the day, we want to have a bill which, as far as is possible, gives certainty&mdash;certainty about the rights and interests of the various stakeholders; certainty about the procedures to be adopted. Hopefully, those procedures&mdash;those streamlined procedures&mdash;are to be such that it will not cost an arm and a leg either to pursue applications for native title, or to contest them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do hope that at the end of the day we come up with some piece of legislation&mdash;we have got to have something&mdash;which, whilst it will not satisfy all the stakeholders, nevertheless will be a piece of legislation that they can live with. Obviously, whenever it might be, at the end of the day the government will need to consent to the legislation, since whatever happens here will have to go to the House of Representatives. I do hope that, if 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we take that approach, the government is more likely to hear and ultimately to agree. I certainly do not want to see a divisive election, and the prospect of a double dissolution election about this particular matter is something that is concerning me. It is, I believe, a weight on people's minds right around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this matter I have received thousands and thousands of letters and representations. Let me say to those who have written to me that I do appreciate what you have done and I am most grateful for your sending those letters and making those representations. It certainly improved my knowledge of the situation. I am grateful to my staff and grateful for the persons who are praying about this issue, praying that parliament will make the right decision. I have also been assisted by the stakeholders. I have been assisted by the Parliamentary Library and the parliamentary officers of this chamber and the other chamber. As an Independent, I rely considerably on the work of the committees, and in this particular regard I pay tribute to the work of the native title committee, and particularly the staff of that committee. There have been 30 volumes of submissions, and I very much appreciate their help. Before I go on, I must say that I hope you recognise that it is impossible for me to write to all of those people who have written to me. I feel embarrassed about that, but I hope you understand that it is impossible for me to write in response to all of the letters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe also that the various task forces, including the Wik task force, have been quite helpful. I do not accept really that they approach their task with a racist approach. I do not accept that. That type of statement does not help the situation, nor does the statement of attack on the churches. I know that some of these statements are born of frustration and false fear. I will not go into that, because time does not permit me to, but there were certain beliefs as a result of the 1993 Native Title Act which have been found to have been unwarranted. One could make a number of quotes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I voted for the Native Title Act. I just refer you to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for what I said on that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9439"> particular occasion. But I also said that it was flawed and we would have to revisit it. Well, we have had to revisit it, and we are doing that right here and now. Mabo, of course, decided that terra nullius was a legal fiction. There have been Aboriginal tribes here for thousands of years. There has been a tradition established, and we need a respect for that tradition and the relationship which Aboriginals have with the land. For thousands of years they have savoured the soil and the land. Some would say, `Forget tradition. We are in a modern society. We are a democracy, we are in control. In today's quick fix economic rationalist democracy there is no place for tradition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who say that there is little or no place for tradition, I would like to say that a modern nation which ignores tradition is unworthy to be called a true democracy. Why? Because tradition is the democracy of the dead. Through tradition, our ancestors have their say; through tradition, our forebears speak to us. We must be sensitive to these non&hyphen;material truths. Many Aboriginals are in fact concerned about some of their own who adopt a purely materialistic view. There is good and bad in everyone. There are ratbags around the place, and I know there are some concerns being expressed on some of the claims by the Aboriginal people themselves. Some suggest that some of those who are involved in it are attempting to make a fast buck. There are certain measures in this legislation which might in fact address that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The skills of Aboriginals have been very important over the years. My father, who was a great hunter out bush where I was born and raised, used to tell me and show me how the Aboriginals tracked their prey. Of course, tradition is not confined to the Aboriginal stakeholders. Other stakeholders, whether miners or pastoral leaseholders, do themselves have great traditions. Many of them were distressed, and feel distressed now, by the actions of some of their forebears. But let us not judge too much in those particular areas. There were certain abhorrent actions taken and those actions need to be condemned&mdash;but the question is whether they should be visited upon future generations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament is challenged. We cannot walk away from that challenge. It is our responsibility. It surely is not the court's responsibility to legislate. We are the legislators; they are the judges. But there are certain matters of principle that we must uphold. Terra nullius was described as a `legal fiction'. And so it was. When the first fleeters came there were people in this land. When those first fleeters came this country was already declared, and is still, Terra Australis&mdash;the great southern land. We all have a passion for Terra Australis. We are all stakeholders in Terra Australis and we in this Senate do have a responsibility to address this matter against the principles that I have suggested. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 December 1862 Abraham Lincoln in his annual message to Congress said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fellow&hyphen;citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honour or dishonour, to the latest generation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was talking during a momentous civil war whose genesis was a conflict within the nation over how a particular race ought be treated. The war followed a split decision made in March 1857 by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in Dred Scott v. Sandford which held that black inhabitants of that country could not become citizens and that Congress had no power to abolish their slavery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is now engaged in a historic debate involving race relations. This follows a split decision of the High Court of Australia made on 23 December 1996 in The Wik Peoples v. The State of Queensland and Others. We cannot escape history. This is so in two senses. First, we are engaged in seeking a solution to a great issue which has been several generations in the making. We have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9440"> inherited a national circumstance which has evolved over two centuries and we must deal with it fairly and effectively in less than a fortnight. Secondly, generations following ours will measure our worth as parliamentarians by the way we so deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We face a great moral issue in this debate. We face an economic and commercial issue but it is predominantly a moral one. Senators before me have spoken about the effect that the native title regime may have on the commercial and economic fate of this country. They are matters to be taken into account. But predominantly the issue is a moral one. The Australian clergy have understood that and have responded accordingly. Along with all other Australians, they have a right and a duty to see to it that the great matter before us is properly resolved. Indeed, their sense of the spiritual gives them a special responsibility. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> has Isaiah saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Woe to those who enact unjust statutes and who write oppressive decrees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the clergy thought that this parliament was about to do that then clearly they ought speak out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that past generations have in large measure left us the issues to which the Wik decision has drawn attention. We should acknowledge this and seek to resolve them with as much consensus as possible. That means the language of debate should be appropriate and that the various parties directly affected by its outcome should be properly recognised as having real interests to sustain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential in this debate that there be accuracy in the community's perception of the relevant facts and law; that the concepts upon which the discussion proceeds be true ones. For example, there is a perception abroad that it is unusual for a multiplicity of people to have various and discrete interests in a single piece of property. So much of the debate has turned upon who owns the land, who should own the land and what effect native title has on the land. And that debate has been carried out in the context that it is unusual in English law, which we have inherited, for there to be a multiplicity of title. But that is just not right. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go into that a little and in doing so&mdash;I noticed Senator Harradine acknowledged his family&mdash;I would like to acknowledge my wife, who I think is one of the outstanding land lawyers in Victoria, in my discussion of land law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a good one, too; but I will make it. For pastoralists and Aborigines to have coexisting interests in a particular area of land is in keeping with the concepts that have underpinned our legal system. We have heard a discussion of the pastoralists, and they are certainly entitled to the full extent of the property rights that the lease gives them. But there is a perception&mdash;which may come from the country&mdash;that city folk do not have other interests than their own in land or the house which they live in. That is not right. We have easements of way, of light&mdash;even in Darwin you have those things, Senator Collins&mdash;of sewerage and of drainage in favour of a neighbour or government. A person may own a house which is both mortgaged and tenanted and is subject to the rights of his mortgagor and of his tenant. A tenant has rights of entry and occupation, and so do the various people who bring services to the house, such as the people who bring gas, electricity and water to the house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have said that in recognising native title the High Court has allowed too much uncertainty to enter Australian law. May I say that, if you can bring certainty to the law and certainty to the situation, that is a good thing. Hopefully, at the end of the debate we will have brought more certainty than presently exists to the land law which provides a context for native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land law, by its very nature, is uncertain, and Justice Brennan pointed that out in Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2) where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land law of England is based on the doctrine of tenure. In English legal theory, every parcel of land in England is held either mediately or immediately of the King, who is Lord Paramount; the term `tenure' is used to signify the relationship between tenant and lord not the relationship between tenant and land. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9441">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will quote a passage&mdash;I know you should not quote passages in giving speeches&mdash;which I think brings it out well. It is from a textbook that we were given when we were taught law. I do not know whether Senator Forshaw had this put upon him, but I thought it was not a bad quote. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most students find the land law difficult. This is due probably to two causes: first, the method of reasoning with its almost casuistical refinements is sometimes difficult to follow; secondly, and probably more importantly, the land law is not very much concerned with land, but with interests in land that have only a notional existence. No man&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was written a while back, and now I would hope it would say `no man or woman'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ever saw a fee simple, which is the greatest interest in land which any citizen can hold and is usually described as ownership of the land. In fact, what is owned is the legal estate in fee simple. Again, the same piece of land may be subject to a number of different interests owned by different persons. Thus, Blackacre may be owned in fee simple by Jones, but his interest may be subject to a lease of Blackacre to Smith for ninety&hyphen;nine years who may in turn have underlet the premises to Robinson for twenty&hyphen;one years. Here are three who will talk of Blackacre of "his." In fact each is an owner, but each owns an interest and does not own the land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear&mdash;Senator Forshaw acknowledges this as he remembers it from his university days&mdash;that there can be a multiplicity of interests in land. To go ahead in the debate on the basis that you have pastoralists' rights and indigenous people's rights, as if those rights were contradictory and could not exist together, is just wrong and against the very concept of the law which we inherited, and that is the common law of England, from which our own law has developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has been a lot of debate based on a concept that is just wrong&mdash;that somehow native title introduces a new concept into the scheme of things which was not there before. As my wife pointed out to me, if you look at the various acts that operate, say, in Victoria&mdash;the Heritage Act, the Town and Country Planning Act and various regulations put forward by the councils in that state&mdash;and which are repeated in other states, it becomes quite apparent that it is a wrong journey for us to go upon when we start talking about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conflict in the giving of native title and pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just make this point before closing: a number of outstanding lawyers have given opinions about various matters to do with this bill, and clearly the Senate must work within the legal parameters set by the constitution and accordingly give great weight to their advice. But we as legislators cannot shift any part of our own responsibility onto others. We must, in the discharge of our personal duties to all the nation, enact measures which are fair and effective in dealing with the legitimate claim every person has in respect of land over which native title does or may exist. In looking at that land, we must ask, `Who has interests in this?' and accord their proper entitlements to them&mdash;not simply to the indigenous people but to all those people who may have a right in that land. Parliament is the one body elected by all adult Australians and accordingly it must fulfil its functions in a proper way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to comment on two unrelated but equally bizarre appearances in the national media this morning. I woke up today to see and hear Territory euthanasia campaigner, Dr Philip Nitschke, announcing to the world that he and a number of unnamed researchers were close to developing a do&hyphen;it&hyphen;yourself suicide pill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Dr Death, his amazing laptop killing machine is about to be superseded. Dr Phil's new kill pill will be concocted from readily available household substances. He is not quite sure if he will dispense this in a form that can be readily popped into your kitchen Mixmaster or whether it will  already come in pill form. He is also not sure how you get around the problem of ensuring it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9442"> does not get into the wrong hands, but that has not prevented him from appearing on national television and radio to tell the world that it will be shortly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One assumes that the pill will be the ultimate upper or downer, depending on how you have lived your life. The timing of the good doctor&mdash;or Nitschke of the Never&hyphen;Never as he is known in some quarters&mdash;is ill&hyphen;timed to say the least. He does not seem to understand that suicide, legally assisted or not, is not the province solely of the terminally ill. No-one could be unmoved by the plight of the lingering, painful death of those with a whole range of terminal illnesses, but the point does need to be reinforced, if only in Dr Nitschke's mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australia, unfortunately, has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world. To the utter devastation of both myself and my wife, last year a 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy whom we knew well committed suicide after attending what appeared to be a perfectly normal day at school. Many young people are still trying to come to terms with the tragic suicide last weekend of Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS. To many young people, Michael Hutchence had it all&mdash;glamour, money and prestige. Many are legitimately confounded by the circumstances of his death and I am sure all of our hearts go out to his partner and their children. I would have thought that the last thing the public debate needed at this point in time was a media blitz by Dr Death and his suicide pill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But possibly more bizarre&mdash;and also dealing with death&mdash;was the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the story detailing the decision of the Member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) to videotape her last will and testament in case of political assassination. I picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to read the headline, ``Fellow Australians, if you are seeing me now, it means I have been murdered'&mdash;Pauline Hanson's video from the grave.' Madam Deputy President, I would like to inform you and reassure you and fellow Australians that, if you are seeing me now, it means I am alive and well and in the Senate and I have not been assassinated by anybody.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is truly bizarre. Sixty seconds of the 12&hyphen;minute video was actually broadcast tonight on national television. The Member for Oxley must now be the only member of any parliament in the world with one soundbite in the grave. What next? Coffin-cam? I believe that this extraordinary video and its public airing on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS> program tonight will indeed remove the last shreds of public credibility from Pauline Hanson and One Nation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it is, Senator. It is clearly a last, desperate attempt by Hanson and her acolytes to arrest the substantial erosion of the nine per cent support she enjoyed at the peak of Hanson media mania. The facts are that no&hyphen;one needs to destroy Pauline Hanson; she has done a great job on herself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy, in fact, to lampoon her and her fears of assassination. I enjoyed very much Mikey Robbins's reference to her on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good News Week</EMPHASIS> when he said that she had the face that launched a thousand chips. I don't know why I am a big fan of Mikey Robbins&mdash;people will have to draw their own conclusions about that. I also agree with Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett's statement today that, if he had recorded a last message to the media every time he had received a death threat in his five years as Premier, he would not have had time to do any other work. Strangely enough, I have no trouble believing that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a serious question about Ms Hanson and her security which remains unanswered. It is this: how much are the extraordinary security measures which surround every move by this backbencher costing Australian taxpayers?  My Labor colleague, Janice Crosio, attempted to find out in a series of questions on notice to the government last year and all she received was a refusal to divulge any information on the spurious grounds that the government did not divulge any matters relating to the operational procedures&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;of the federal or state police. But what a nonsense; she was not asking for any details of operational procedures. She simply wanted to know, as we are all entitled to know, the cost of the extraordi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9443"> nary security which surrounds every movement of this bizarre backbencher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have since placed my own series of questions on notice making that very point. The opposition does not want to know anything about the procedures; it simply wants to know how much it is costing taxpayers to provide such security to a backbencher. Needless to say, I await the government's response, and goodnight to you all.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.35 p.m." PAGE="9443"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.35 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
